1
00:00:04,421 --> 00:00:05,713
Approved

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,759
Chef from South Park. It's genius.
Just some chef.

3
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:14,596
I've decided to pre-screen all of
the Halloween costumes this year

4
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:15,889
I have three simple rules

5
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,100
don't be offensive
don't be clichÃ©

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:20,936
and don't take the first
two rules too seriously

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,982
The gorilla from Rise of
the Planet of the Apes.

8
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:26,275
Huh?

9
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,569
The one who
sacrifices his life

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,820
Whoa! Oh

11
00:00:29,904 --> 00:00:32,698
Spoiler alert It's been
out for ages, man.

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,575
Costume vetoed

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:37,369
Uh.

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,080
It's... Somebody's
already called that

15
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:43,375
Who? Kevin has a gorilla
suit you could borrow.

16
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:46,211
This is ridiculous! Why can't there
just be two Kate Middletons?

17
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,381
Guys, I know, I mean I
wish there could be too

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,925
It's like I can't choose

19
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,886
They're both
amazing, it's just

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,722
Look, I stayed up all night and
I watched that g. D. wedding

21
00:00:56,806 --> 00:00:58,974
and then I came to work and I made
everyone else watch it all day

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,727
Meredith wasn't even here
Because I was there

23
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,773
You're the people's princess!
Diana was nothing!

24
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:07,649
I thought you were
at your sister's funeral

25
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,195
What I said was "My sister's
funeral is this weekend.'

26
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,404
Didn't say
I'd be there

27
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,324
Why is it such a shock
that I follow the royal story?

28
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:19,369
Warms my heart thinking
about them two kids...

29
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,955
...doing it

30
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,404
Can I maybe
squeeze through?

31
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,742
Here you go
There we go. Thank you.

32
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,995
When they talk about app the nice
things about dating a co-worker,

33
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,997
they don't mention
one of the best parts.

34
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,835
After you're done dating, you still
get to work together every single day

35
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,964
Jim, put it on

36
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:14,007
Put it on, man

37
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,969
I don't know if I can.
Come on the Three Amigos

38
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,138
Three Kings.
All right

39
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,224
I know, I know, I know. But
Darryl and Kevin needed a third.

40
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,643
They bought me
this jersey. I said no

41
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:28,397
Kevin started crying, so
I am Chris Bosh.

42
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:32,317
If you get into season
one, you know, really

43
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,570
Oh, my God, what the he
is wrong with you?

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,989
It's called a costume

45
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,740
What are you? Some kind
of Jamaican zombie woman?

46
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,493
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
Whoopi Goldberg.

47
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,746
Has no one here heard
of Kerrigan, from StarCraft?

48
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,999
Queen of blades

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,335
It's all Toby's fault

50
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,171
Every Halloween,
I tell him the same thing

51
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,089
You can't bring weapons
into the office.

52
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,216
And every year he says
the same thing.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,802
"As soon as I get my weapons
back, I'm going to kill you."

54
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,556
But there I am at
Thanksgiving alive, you know?

55
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,184
I'm a lucky turkey

56
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:11,273
Everybody looking good?
This is the best we can do?

57
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,068
I'm not judging. I think you
guys look great, I just

58
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,864
...want to make sure this
is the best we can do

59
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,450
I just got a text
from Broccoli Rob. "Boo!'

60
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,702
It scared me

61
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,205
And then I got this text
from Robert California

62
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,082
"Looking forward to Halloween
party Expectations are high.'

63
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,502
Scared the *
out of me

64
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,381
G'day, Pameroo Could you
shoot this off for me?

65
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,342
Yeah.
Australian accent

66
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,891
What are you doing? I just
wanted to see how you do it.

67
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,392
If you're doing
something I don't

68
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,235
Are you That Andy
so hot and cold

69
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,278
One day he's like,
"Fax these documents, please.'

70
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,657
The next he's like, "Pam, you fax them.
Who cares what Erin's feeling." Right?

71
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,408
Oh, Erin
Pam

72
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,994
how would you rate me as a receptionist
on a scale of one to three?

73
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,412
Um

74
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,538
Two?

75
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,415
It's like the second to
last thing I wanted to hear

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,792
No, I mean
you're doing great

77
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,628
and Andy put you in charge
of the whole party, right?

78
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,171
Yeah
Yeah.

79
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,509
Send completed. You are the
best in the biz. I can't deny

80
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,887
Bob and I are doing this
Scranton haunted walking tour

81
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,181
I always wondered what kind
of people went on that thing.

82
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,267
Hey, if you go
by the Banshee Pub

83
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:31,520
tell the Man in Black
I say hello

84
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,360
What happened, Pam?
Okay.

85
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:42,155
When I was 22, I worked there and
everybody said the place was haunted.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,367
I didn't believe it until
one day before we opened

87
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,287
I look up into the mirror
you know, behind the bar?

88
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,541
And I see this old man
dressed all in black,

89
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:56,545
but when I turn around
there's no one there.

90
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,048
So, I tell the cook my story
Wait, they have food there?

91
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,633
...and he said

92
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:05,887
"That's what everyone sees
That's the Man in Black.'

93
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,018
No. My wife does not
believe in ghosts

94
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,272
Hey
Hey

95
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,356
Oh

96
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,234
This Man in Black thing What
do you think that was about?

97
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,486
What do you mean? Was it
like trickery in the lights

98
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,780
or maybe you were so primed
to see it then there it was

99
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,158
I saw a ghost
Mm-hmm

100
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,910
What I'm saying is, like do
you ever wonder what it was?

101
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,288
It was a ghost. I told you
this on like our first date

102
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,333
Yeah, I had just told you about the
day that I met the Blue Angels.

103
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,336
I figured you had to top it I
don't know what to tell you, Jim

104
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,171
but I saw a ghost

105
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:46,345
Hey

106
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:47,637
Uh-oh

107
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:50,766
Looks like we're under a Jack attack.
- Yes, Andrew.

108
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,436
And you, on this day of
fantasy, are a labourer

109
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,359
Yes Everyone, this
is Bert, my son.

110
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,279
Bert, this is
a paper company

111
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,697
Hey, Bert

112
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,282
Hello

113
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,993
Can I use a computer?
I need to check a hurricane

114
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:11,703
Here, use this one

115
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:15,624
All right

116
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,461
Oh, look, pin the word
on the witch

117
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,463
How did you know
I was bringing my son?

118
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,633
I didn't. It was for us
But he can play.

119
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,760
Berty Boy, would you
like to play this game?

120
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,261
That stuff's for babies

121
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,557
Perhaps this party will
awaken the baby in all of us

122
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,520
Wow. Who shot our grownup
party with the kiddy ray gun?

123
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,856
We're still getting it set up
It's going to be really cool

124
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,446
Extraordinary.
Did you plan this?

125
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,657
Well, Toby and I did, yeah

126
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,411
And I overheard and thought "Hey,
that'd be fun don't mind if I do.'

127
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,247
If you turn out the lights
we'll do a little dance

128
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,165
One, two, three

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,836
Dem bones, dem bones,
dem dry bones

130
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,839
Now we're the skeleton crew

131
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,259
Delightful.
Thank you

132
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,428
Now then
how are we today?

133
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,887
Fine
Great.

134
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,431
Just fine, Kelly?
Everything all right?

135
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:13,598
Mm-hmm

136
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,475
You feeling fulfilled
in your life?

137
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,685
I guess

138
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,604
You guess? So there is
something you want that you

139
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,815
do not have

140
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,025
Try not to think
about it

141
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,737
Because it's too
terrifying to imagine

142
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,198
Now we're cooking

143
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,453
What is it, Kelly? What is
this great fear of yours?

144
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:39,541
Never marrying Yes. Dying
alone, that is very scary.

145
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,587
And how are you, Toby?

146
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,547
So great

147
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,180
Oh, I put those up. I know.
I'm taking them down.

148
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,767
I almost wonder if putting
nothing on this wall

149
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,021
is more Halloween-y

150
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,814
I don't know
about this, guys

151
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,941
Andy put me in charge of
the Halloween party, so.

152
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,360
Well, Andy sent us
in here, so which is it?

153
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:09,154
Oh

154
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:12,949
So can we speak our minds now? Or
are we still sparing feelings?

155
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,243
Because I hate
all of this.

156
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,915
Very low pressure
in the Sargasso Sea

157
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,125
Warm air from South America

158
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,004
Cold air from Greenland All signs
point to the perfect storm.

159
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,256
Perfectly mediocre

160
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,549
What are you, anyway?

161
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,427
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman
Leave me alone, ghoul

162
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,138
If you had some really big
wings with blades on the end

163
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,766
you'd kind of look like
Kerrigan from StarCraft.

164
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,353
Damn it! I am Kerrigan from StarCraft.
I've been censored.

165
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,939
If you're going to be a
Zerg, at least be a lurker

166
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,192
Not some girl. Kerrigan is
ruler of the Zerg swarm

167
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,779
Yeah. She also has boobs.
Yeah, but no nipples

168
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,117
Hey
Hey, what's up?

169
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:59,955
November's sure creeping up, ain't it?
You can't stop that month

170
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:07,295
Hey, what's the jive with Angela and
Phyllis helping with the party, you know?

171
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:10,423
Um

172
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:12,717
I just thought you could
use some help, you know?

173
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:16,096
'Cause Robert came in and thought
the party seemed a little kiddy.

174
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:19,099
And I guess I agreed
And maybe we could

175
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,561
mix a little more 13
into the PG.

176
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:27,816
But that's it?

177
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,443
There's nothing
about me or I?

178
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,198
Can we talk about it
at the end of the day?

179
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,159
I got a call
I got to make a call

180
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,121
Yeah, sorry
Yes, we can

181
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,550
Yes. I don't know

182
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,343
Mm-hmm

183
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,264
Gabe?
Sweet Erin

184
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,017
I'm throwing the Halloween party and
I just want to amp it up a little.

185
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:05,103
I think it could use
some extra pizzazz

186
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,147
Okay. Where does
Gabe factor in?

187
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,566
Remember that Halloween
party you took me to once?

188
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:13,278
The one where I started crying
as soon as I walked in

189
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:16,156
and I didn't stop crying?
Yes. Lars and Takako's

190
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,868
Okay, well let's say that I
wanted this party to be a tiny

191
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,162
tiny bit like that one

192
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,584
just more adult,
more scary and sexy

193
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,628
I will make this sexier
than you could ever imagine

194
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,256
No, just scary. If we wanted
ideas for scary stuff

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,641
No, that'd be scary
What are you thinking about?

196
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,560
All right, let me go get it

197
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,608
Pam Halpert
Hey. It's Jim Halpert.

198
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,319
I was wondering if you wanted
to see a movie tonight

199
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,905
'cause I've read a lot about
this really great documentary

200
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,824
Is it called Ghostbusters?
It's called Ghostbusters.

201
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,410
It didn't look like that

202
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,329
He didn't have
a buster sign around him?

203
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,706
Why don't you draw him? Why
don't we see this old man?

204
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,084
Okay. Yeah. Fine,
I'll draw him Okay.

205
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,545
I ain't afraid of no ghosts

206
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,091
Whoa

207
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,093
Mm-hmm

208
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,553
Dwight, are you eating a stick?
It's a root, idiot.

209
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,930
Okay

210
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,101
Everyone hates you.
That's really rude

211
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,770
I don't tell you hurricanes
suck even though it's true

212
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,023
What do you like, tornadoes?
Try influenza

213
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,693
Yeah? What's the vaccine you
could take to avoid a hurricane?

214
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,029
Open up a newspaper.
Look, a hurricane's coming

215
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,949
I suppose you're going to tell me
the scariest animal is a shark.

216
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,534
Try box jellyfish

217
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,872
What are we talking about?

218
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,375
I was talking about my wife and
how she believes in ghosts

219
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,878
Then we had a little debate and then
Meredith said that she believes in them too

220
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,381
You seem unimpressed.
Ghosts don't scare you?

221
00:11:56,465 --> 00:12:01,845
I'm only scared of real things,
like serial killers and kidnappers.

222
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:05,473
Not things that don't exist
like ghosts or mummies

223
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,351
Mummies are real There
are mummies at museums

224
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,478
Yeah

225
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,272
You prank

226
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,441
It's true. They've
been preserved for

227
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,902
thousands of years
They're all over.

228
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:24,993
Why on Earth would a
museum put a mummy in it?

229
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,460
A little
witch's brew?

230
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,171
I grew this party
up real fast.

231
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,257
Get out of here, little kid party.
Nobody loves you.

232
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:43,094
And clean up your room Grownups
are going to use it later

233
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,181
The party looks fun
doesn't it?

234
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,017
Everybody seems to be in
there having a great time

235
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,228
So maybe now would be a great time
for me to pop back on the computer

236
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,148
I'm using it. I'm about to
play StarCraft with him

237
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,402
You serious?
Yeah, I'm serious

238
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,571
Hey, hey. That's funny

239
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,699
Okay.
Loser

240
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,287
Pam, do you think anyone's going to
notice I've worn this costume before

241
00:13:09,371 --> 00:13:11,164
when I wasn't pregnant?

242
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,792
You know I guess nobody would
believe it still fits.

243
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:19,964
Hey, guys, I'm
an Oscar Liar Weiner

244
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,716
Oh, my God

245
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,969
Party's tight, E Fog is cool.
Thanks

246
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,846
It's on medium
Perfect

247
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,724
It really looks great
You did a great job

248
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,560
Oh. So we don't have
to have that talk?

249
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,479
We should still
have that talk

250
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,065
Maybe you could come by
my office at like 4:45?

251
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,943
Cool

252
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,862
Okay.

253
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,365
Okay, everybody,

254
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,494
be prepared
to be scared

255
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,579
Okay

256
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:13,101
The Cinema of the Unsettling
is a growing film movement.

257
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,479
The most well known film in the
genre is an hour long shot

258
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,107
of a squirrel
with diarrhea

259
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,613
Okay. Ew

260
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,826
Is that my grandmother?

261
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,537
What's the story?
- There is no story.

262
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,581
Yeah, seems like
there isn't a narrative.

263
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:38,042
Maybe the filmmaker realized that
even narrative is comforting

264
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,546
What the he
is going on here?

265
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,714
Okay, I think
we've seen enough

266
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,799
You can turn it off now
- Yeah

267
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,969
Yeah, kill it. go ahead
and turn it off.

268
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,721
Thank you - How'd
you get in my car?

269
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:51,639
Where is this from?
That is so upsetting

270
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,893
That was awful
Robert, I apologize

271
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:58,646
I'm sorry. I got confused
I heard that you

272
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,067
wanted to make the party more adult
but I think I know what to do now

273
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,779
This game is called
"Pecker Poker.'

274
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,825
It's the game of cards
that gets you hard.

275
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,497
What we have here is a
classic misunderstanding.

276
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,500
Why didn't you simply
ask Andy to clarify?

277
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,420
Asking is a very
easy thing to do

278
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,006
The two of you are
obviously very close

279
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,682
Oh, I see. This no longer
seems like my business

280
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,190
All I knew is that

281
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,567
you wanted to have a talk
with me at the end of the day

282
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,110
and I got nervous, so

283
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,738
You were going
to talk at the end of

284
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,906
I'm not here

285
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,369
Did you think I was
going to fire you?

286
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:57,163
No, I wasn't

287
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,210
I'm sorry This must be
really uncomfortable for you

288
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,379
I'm never uncomfortable

289
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,797
Okay

290
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,551
Erin, I think you know
I've been dating someone

291
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,012
Sure

292
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,264
And it's getting
a little more serious

293
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,893
She's never come by, so
And she's never called here

294
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,646
Unless it's your mom

295
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,984
No, I didn't want her to call because
I thought it would be weird, but

296
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,986
now it's weird
that she's not calling

297
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,071
Two dates?

298
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,615
Three dates?

299
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,575
Thirty-one

300
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,245
Wow

301
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,665
I'm so happy
for you guys.

302
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,583
Um. Let me know
when you get to 40

303
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,753
I'll see you guys

304
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,258
I should go

305
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,637
I just don't get it, Pam

306
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:56,514
I mean, you're a rational
person Thank you.

307
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:59,100
Jim doesn't let me wash his NFL
jersey during the playoffs

308
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,602
How is this any less logical?
Careful. Whoa

309
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:05,148
First of all, it's not like I think
that's going to help the Eagles win

310
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:06,566
Really?
No.

311
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,402
That is just a bunch of people
participating in a collective thing.

312
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,697
And maybe the Eagles will hear about
it and want to play better. It's not

313
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,032
Exactly.
Thank you

314
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,408
Go! Get up there
right now.

315
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,868
Got it
Dwight

316
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,120
You want to attack, or let them come to us?
Your call, B.

317
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,372
Unleash the hell storm.
- Dwight

318
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,291
Nice
Dwight

319
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,584
Got 'em. Go

320
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,422
Is she Asian? I don't know.
She's from somewhere, I bet

321
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,717
Maybe from the forest
Forest?

322
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,594
Did Andy say his girlfriend's
from the forest?

323
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,263
I don't know, Phyllis
Maybe she's from the city

324
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,146
Looks terribly real
doesn't it, Creed?

325
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,899
No
Are you scared of snakes?

326
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,358
You don't live
as long as I have

327
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,402
without a healthy fear
of snakes, Bobby.

328
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:56,908
Yeah, I guess sometimes I have
nightmares about being buried alive.

329
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,828
Honestly, Jim gives
me the creeps

330
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,790
What am I up to?

331
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,293
Like a few years
down the road, Cece says

332
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,587
"Mom, there's
a ghost in my closet.'

333
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:12,840
Now you say one of two things One,
"You're just having a bad dream."

334
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,759
Or two, "Let's go see
what it wants."

335
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,594
I'm not going
to freak her out, Jim

336
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,429
Okay I'm not going
to lie to her either

337
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,557
Oh, come on
When I was a boy,

338
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:27,188
there was an empty house just
up the h from my family's

339
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,483
It was rumored a man
committed suicide there

340
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,069
after being possessed
by the devil

341
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:36,364
One day, a young woman, Lydia

342
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:39,450
moved into the house
with her infant child.

343
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:45,081
That very night Lydia was awakened
by a loud heinous hissing sound

344
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:52,213
She walked to the nursery and
there in baby's crib was a snake

345
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,507
wrapped around baby's neck

346
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,968
squeezing tighter and tighter

347
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,054
Oh, my goodness
The crib was full of dirt,

348
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:03,266
baby struggled to free
itself from underneath

349
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:07,270
reaching and clawing
gasping for air

350
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:11,774
Embalmed bodies rose
from their sarcophagi,

351
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,818
lurching toward baby

352
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,656
For they were mummies
No.

353
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,783
Amongst them was a man

354
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,287
Tall, slim.
Jim

355
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,915
Almost instinctively
she turned to her husband

356
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,001
"Wait," she thought

357
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,463
"I don't have a husband.'

358
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:39,677
For Lydia and her husband had had an
argument one they couldn't get past

359
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:44,515
Each night they slept one inch farther
apart until one night Lydia left

360
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,978
It was about this time she lost
herself in imaginary worlds.

361
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,481
She had quit the
book club the choir,

362
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,735
citing something about
their high expectations

363
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,488
Her lips slowly
grew together from disuse

364
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,116
Every time she wanted
to act, and didn't,

365
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,536
another part of her face
hardened until it was stone

366
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,290
And that fevered night
she rushed to the nursery

367
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,877
and threw open the door
"Baby, are you okay?"

368
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,963
Baby sat up slowly

369
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,051
turned to mother

370
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,177
and said

371
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,558
"I'm fine, bitch. I'm fine.'

372
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,987
Fear plays an interesting
role in our lives.

373
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,282
How dare we let
it motivate us?

374
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,037
How dare we let it into our decision
making? Into our livelihoods.

375
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,164
Into our relationships.

376
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:56,254
It's funny, isn't it? We take a day a year
to dress up in costume and celebrate fear.

377
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,551
Toby. Hey, Bert. Want
to see the dance?

378
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,428
Dem bones,
dem bones, dem dry...

379
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:05,596
You're fired

380
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,724
What?
You heard me.

381
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:09,850
Pack your things

382
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,146
What? You can't
Gabe? Are you

383
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,274
I'm the CEO's son

384
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:18,693
Pack your things
You're done.
