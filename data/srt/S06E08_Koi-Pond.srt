1
00:00:02,467 --> 00:00:06,460
And then, I think I'm going
to go to the garlic festival.

2
00:00:06,538 --> 00:00:08,597
Wow. Sounds like fun.
You guys would love it.

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:10,470
No, we wouldn't.
They have a TCBY booth.

4
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:12,373
Cool. Same stuff you get downtown.

5
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,036
Do you like TCBY?
Who doesn't?

6
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:19,311
"I can't believe it's
yogurt." Lt'll be fun.

7
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:22,683
I confirmed with Raskin Design and they're
expecting the both of you in an hour.

8
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:24,449
Oh, actually, it's just going to be me.

9
00:00:24,523 --> 00:00:26,150
They said
the both of you.

10
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:27,384
That's a mistake.

11
00:00:27,459 --> 00:00:29,586
You should give them
a call, check that out.

12
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:32,027
All right,
just clear this up.

13
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,395
Well, there's actually been
a few changes in the company,

14
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,900
and Michael and I are
actually at the same level.

15
00:00:36,968 --> 00:00:39,232
So, I can... No.

16
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:42,035
No, why would
that be a problem?

17
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:43,904
Jim's a good kid,
he can handle a lot,

18
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:47,843
but sometimes you
have to call in a master.

19
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:52,983
Why would you date an amateur
when you could date a professional?

20
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:55,579
Great. See you then.

21
00:00:55,654 --> 00:00:57,019
What?

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,114
They said that they would feel
more comfortable if you came along.

23
00:01:00,192 --> 00:01:02,126
Why don't they just want
you to go by yourself?

24
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,628
Why do they want me to come,
too? I don't understand.

25
00:01:04,696 --> 00:01:06,664
I absolutely don't
understand, either.

26
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:10,633
I don't want you to feel like
I'm babysitting you or something.

27
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:13,037
All right.
All right.

28
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:15,698
Let me go get your stroller.

29
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,873
Sure.
Michael's a good teacher.

30
00:01:18,944 --> 00:01:20,809
A teacher is someone who stands

31
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,312
right next to you
your whole life

32
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,280
and never lets
you do anything.

33
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:26,214
That's what
a teacher is, right?

34
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,631
What are you going to call him? Dave.

35
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:50,607
No. What is his name? Dave.

36
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,734
Mr. Borchard.
They're very formal.

37
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,210
Yeah. I've spoken
to them on the phone.

38
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,747
Yeah, well,
this is not the phone.

39
00:01:56,815 --> 00:02:00,216
This is real life, baby,
and you got to own it.

40
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:01,650
Is that what
you are wearing?

41
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,744
Yes, it is.

42
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,847
And that is the watch
that you are going to wear?

43
00:02:05,924 --> 00:02:08,984
No, it is not. You
should wear this watch.

44
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,288
I will loan it to you.

45
00:02:10,362 --> 00:02:12,887
It is a Tankard. I highly
recommend you wear that.

46
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:14,898
No, thanks.
They are into style.

47
00:02:14,966 --> 00:02:15,955
Mmm-hmm.

48
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,002
They are into appearance.
We are selling success.

49
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:20,663
And paper.
That's sort of secondary.

50
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,866
Nope. No.

51
00:02:23,208 --> 00:02:26,075
He's trying to
micro co-manage me.

52
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:30,342
Or co-micromanage me.

53
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,518
Here we are outside of
the Wilkes-Barre... W.B.

54
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:36,019
...lndustrial Park.
Industrial P.

55
00:02:36,688 --> 00:02:38,121
Making cold calls.

56
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:39,952
The two people
with the lowest sales

57
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,219
in the quarter
have to do them.

58
00:02:42,527 --> 00:02:46,088
<i>Palpabon
Drilling, where are you</i>

59
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:50,123
<i>Dean Trophies,
suite 100</i>

60
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:53,432
<i>Sherman Blinds & Rugs,
suite 202</i>

61
00:02:53,505 --> 00:02:54,529
Here it is.

62
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:55,766
<i>Palpabon Drilling</i>

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,364
Suite 401.

64
00:02:57,442 --> 00:02:58,932
Yeah, I was going
to sing that part.

65
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,136
I know. Now you
don't have to.

66
00:03:00,211 --> 00:03:02,406
Well, except it was going
to resolve the melody,

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,141
so now my head hurts.

68
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:06,149
It feels like
I held in a sneeze.

69
00:03:06,217 --> 00:03:09,186
I hate this feeling.

70
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:13,950
<i>Suite 401</i>

71
00:03:17,062 --> 00:03:18,654
All right.

72
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:20,823
Hi. Any messages?

73
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:21,923
You're soaking wet.

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,991
Oh, well, Jim and I
got caught in a little

75
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,266
flash rain, flash winds,
flash lightning.

76
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:28,966
Wow. Sounds scary.

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,532
It was. It was. And then
in an instant, it wasn't.

78
00:03:32,978 --> 00:03:34,104
Why isn't Jim wet?

79
00:03:34,179 --> 00:03:35,237
I outran it.

80
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:38,214
I don't think it rained.
My hip would be throbbing.

81
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:40,217
It rained. Michael,
can I get you something?

82
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,411
A towel, some cocoa?

83
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:43,249
Nothing. Cocoa.

84
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,388
I'll just leave that
suit in your office, then?

85
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,425
Good, yeah.

86
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:49,719
Must be nice to have
company on these cold calls.

87
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:52,319
We're kind of
a dynamic duo.

88
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:53,625
Or trio.

89
00:03:53,898 --> 00:03:56,867
How exciting! Do you
guys know the sex yet?

90
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:58,834
Oh, no, no.

91
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:03,407
We're not together. No,
no, no. Definitely not.

92
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,445
Definitely not. No,
we just work together.

93
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:11,412
Looks like somebody's got
a case of the definitelys.

94
00:04:15,253 --> 00:04:18,313
Michael, the custodian from
Raskin Design is on the line.

95
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,119
He said they found your
keys in the koi pond.

96
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:21,783
Okay, thank you.

97
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:24,489
Did you say
koi pond?

98
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:29,095
Yeah? Michael, people
are asking questions.

99
00:04:29,167 --> 00:04:31,533
<i>Okay. Put them on speaker.</i>

100
00:04:31,603 --> 00:04:32,797
Hey, guys,
what's going on?

101
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:35,499
<i>Hey, Michael, did you
fall into a koi pond?</i>

102
00:04:35,573 --> 00:04:38,906
<i>I can't really hear you. I think
we have sort of a bad connection.</i>

103
00:04:38,977 --> 00:04:41,605
Jim, did Michael
fall into a koi pond?

104
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,407
It's like Michael said.
It was something else.

105
00:04:46,484 --> 00:04:49,612
Okay, this is what it was.
It was these bunch of idiots

106
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:54,125
that had put a fish tank in the
ground with no cover and no railing.

107
00:04:54,192 --> 00:04:55,318
So you fell in?
No.

108
00:04:55,393 --> 00:04:57,861
Maybe I was trying to save
a child that had fallen in.

109
00:04:57,929 --> 00:04:59,157
So a child
had fallen in?

110
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,424
Not yet.

111
00:05:00,498 --> 00:05:01,829
That is hilarious.

112
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,391
No. Don't. I'm not going to
bump. I'm not going to bump.

113
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:08,132
And it was not hilarious.
It was very, very terrifying.

114
00:05:10,308 --> 00:05:12,333
Truthfully, it wasn't
the way he fell in.

115
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,937
It was how long it
took him to get out.

116
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,881
And we'd like to offer you
15% off your first purchase

117
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:21,316
as our way of welcoming
you to the area.

118
00:05:21,386 --> 00:05:23,149
Well, that sounds
like a really nice deal.

119
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:24,245
Sha-bow!

120
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:27,052
And I must say that since
we are a family business,

121
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,717
it's nice to see
that you are, too.

122
00:05:28,793 --> 00:05:30,260
Oh!

123
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:33,422
Wow. You thought that...

124
00:05:33,498 --> 00:05:36,058
Oh, my gosh.
Definitely not.

125
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:37,761
My mistake.
I'm sorry.

126
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:38,860
It's okay.

127
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:41,929
Nah, actually,
it's kind of not okay.

128
00:05:42,574 --> 00:05:45,042
I date models.
Face models.

129
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:49,775
My girlfriend, on a
scale of one-to-Gisele,

130
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:52,642
a nine.

131
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:53,775
That's good for you.

132
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:56,286
Anyway, we also have a
special on envelopes...

133
00:05:56,354 --> 00:05:58,549
Pam's carrying
our surrogate

134
00:05:58,623 --> 00:06:03,390
because my girlfriend needed to
keep her figure for Fashion Week.

135
00:06:03,895 --> 00:06:06,125
So, we put
our baby in Pam.

136
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:07,960
It doesn't matter
what Pam looks like.

137
00:06:09,033 --> 00:06:10,057
Yeah.

138
00:06:10,135 --> 00:06:12,365
You were way meaner
to me than I was to you.

139
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:14,268
No, I wasn't, okay?

140
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,069
The very idea of us together
made you burst out laughing

141
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:20,111
like you just bit into an Adam
Sandler and jelly sandwich.

142
00:06:20,178 --> 00:06:22,976
You blew the sale,
you idiot!

143
00:06:23,047 --> 00:06:24,514
Let me tell you something.

144
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,107
I was never going
to make that sale.

145
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,615
Erin, do we have any of those
clips that hold paper together?

146
00:06:30,688 --> 00:06:31,916
Staples?

147
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,458
David Wallace called.

148
00:06:35,527 --> 00:06:36,926
Oh, he did?
What did he say?

149
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:39,088
He heard you made a big
splash at the meeting.

150
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:41,359
Oh, my God, that was so mean what
I just said, and I didn't mean it.

151
00:06:41,432 --> 00:06:42,922
It was Kevin and Meredith
who put me up to it.

152
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:45,026
Okay.

153
00:06:45,103 --> 00:06:46,730
I'm going to kill you.

154
00:06:46,805 --> 00:06:48,636
Michael, don't
listen to them.

155
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:49,695
Thank you, Stanley.

156
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:51,833
You just ignore
their carping.

157
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:52,934
Okay.

158
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:54,035
Michael?
Yes.

159
00:06:54,112 --> 00:06:56,774
A carp is both a fish
and a term for complaining.

160
00:06:56,848 --> 00:06:58,247
They're mocking you
with word play.

161
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,546
Hey, boss,
did you find Nemo?

162
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:02,745
I can name
Pixar movies, too.

163
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,255
<i>Toy Story.
Don't you mean Koi Story?</i>

164
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:09,187
And when you fell in,
did you flounder?

165
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:12,595
Michael, flounder is
both a kind of a fish...

166
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:13,995
I know what a flounder is.

167
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,057
Hey, Michael.
No! No!

168
00:07:16,134 --> 00:07:17,761
No more! That is it!

169
00:07:17,836 --> 00:07:19,599
Everybody in the
conference room, right now!

170
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:22,606
I'm not usually
the butt of the joke.

171
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,471
I'm usually
the face of the joke.

172
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:29,106
I wish Jim had fallen
into that pond.

173
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,807
Then he'd have
to put on my suit,

174
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,783
and it would be too
short, and he'd look...

175
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,853
Damn it,
he'd still look good.

176
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:40,580
The most fundamental thing
about sensitivity training

177
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:45,254
is that you cannot make fun of a
person for something or some action

178
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:47,730
that they have done
that they regret.

179
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,926
You can only make fun of things
that they have control over.

180
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:55,235
Like, Oscar is gay.
That is his choice.

181
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:59,743
We can make fun of that. I did
not choose to fall into a koi pond.

182
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:01,904
Michael, you still
can't make fun of people

183
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,710
for race or gender or sexual
orientation or religion...

184
00:08:04,782 --> 00:08:07,080
Who let the lemonhead
into the room?

185
00:08:07,151 --> 00:08:08,982
You are a waste of life
and you should give up.

186
00:08:11,456 --> 00:08:14,220
Is what I want to say
but I won't,

187
00:08:14,292 --> 00:08:17,261
because that is why we
are doing this right now.

188
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:20,923
So, Toby, welcome to sensitivity
training for real. Show of hands.

189
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,292
Who here has
been koi-ponded?

190
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:28,532
Who here has been the butt of
a joke that has gone too far?

191
00:08:28,606 --> 00:08:31,769
Phyllis. Michael, you
make fun of us every day.

192
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,640
Yeah. Every single day.

193
00:08:33,711 --> 00:08:35,076
You never said anything.

194
00:08:35,146 --> 00:08:36,613
We have. Countless times.

195
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:40,742
Well, it is hard to tell the
difference between you guys saying,

196
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:42,410
"Stop, because
I want you to stop,"

197
00:08:42,487 --> 00:08:46,423
or stop as in, "Stop, you're
making me laugh so hard.

198
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:49,255
"What you're doing is so
funny. You're on a roll.

199
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,090
"I am busting
a gut. Stop!"

200
00:08:52,063 --> 00:08:53,553
That's never
been the case.

201
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:55,963
We are going to make

202
00:08:56,034 --> 00:09:01,995
a Do Not Mock list.

203
00:09:02,073 --> 00:09:07,238
Okay? Anything that we think might
be out of bounds, we put on this list.

204
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,012
Anything you put on this list,
you cannot be teased about.

205
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:12,140
Got it?

206
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:13,774
I'm going to kick it off.

207
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:19,619
Let's see what I have
to put on the list, right?

208
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,022
Okay.

209
00:09:21,092 --> 00:09:25,051
I also have fallen into the
fountain at the Steamtown Mall.

210
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,290
You fell into
a second fountain?

211
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,861
Can you kick me
out of the meeting now?

212
00:09:30,935 --> 00:09:32,368
Go. Go.

213
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,741
Starting today, teasing
will no longer be tolerated.

214
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:41,539
You mean there's
no teasing of any kind?

215
00:09:41,612 --> 00:09:45,048
No, no, no, just things that are on
the list. That is the beauty of it.

216
00:09:45,116 --> 00:09:47,516
Okay, who else? Who
else? Dwight, come on.

217
00:09:47,585 --> 00:09:49,485
I don't want people
making fun of my nose.

218
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,021
Your nose?

219
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,986
It's too small.

220
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:56,993
The geometric proportions of my face
are perfect in every way but one.

221
00:09:57,895 --> 00:09:59,829
My nose is too small.

222
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:01,888
I mean, it still works.
I can smell things.

223
00:10:01,966 --> 00:10:05,163
I just have to be a lot
closer than most people.

224
00:10:05,903 --> 00:10:07,029
Oh, my.
That is small.

225
00:10:07,105 --> 00:10:08,732
Just write it
down, please.

226
00:10:08,806 --> 00:10:10,000
Can you
breathe okay?

227
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:11,666
What keeps your
glasses on?

228
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,142
Hey, it's on the list,
everybody.

229
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:15,509
No, I haven't
finished writing.

230
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,880
Did you sneeze it off?
That's it. No more. Okay.

231
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,976
Who else, who else? Everybody's
going to get their chance.

232
00:10:22,053 --> 00:10:24,886
I don't want people
making fun of my weight.

233
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,151
Okay, that's too broad. It's
got to be something else.

234
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,386
How about your
stomach? Yeah?

235
00:10:31,496 --> 00:10:34,727
Who else? I'm very sensitive
about my petite figure.

236
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:35,988
Oh, God.

237
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:39,795
I am. I'm afraid of being
thrown around like a football.

238
00:10:40,204 --> 00:10:42,604
Well, you know, Nicole Richie
might think that you are fat.

239
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:44,402
Does that make
you feel better?

240
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:45,533
Meredith?

241
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,770
I don't want to
say it out loud.

242
00:10:46,844 --> 00:10:49,472
Okay, fine. Come on up
here, write it yourself.

243
00:10:49,547 --> 00:10:52,607
And don't sign your name
to it, and nobody look.

244
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:56,216
Everybody,
look away, look away.

245
00:10:56,621 --> 00:10:58,816
Well, I really didn't want
to put it on the board,

246
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,154
but I thought maybe it was
going to come out somehow.

247
00:11:01,225 --> 00:11:03,420
So, what are you
going to do?

248
00:11:09,067 --> 00:11:10,056
Okay.

249
00:11:10,134 --> 00:11:11,829
Some of you
may have noticed

250
00:11:11,903 --> 00:11:18,206
I'm in that kind of ill-defined
relationship type of thing.

251
00:11:18,276 --> 00:11:19,709
Okay, what do you
want me to write?

252
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:21,472
Just put Kelly.
Aw!

253
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:22,535
That still going on?

254
00:11:22,613 --> 00:11:24,137
I will claw
your tiny nose off.

255
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:25,648
It's on the list.

256
00:11:25,716 --> 00:11:27,081
Creed, your turn.

257
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:29,517
If I write it down,
I can't be charged with it.

258
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,114
No one said that.

259
00:11:31,556 --> 00:11:34,753
That is our sales pitch,
and we are sticking to it.

260
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,791
Well, you two are quite the
salesmen, and a very cute couple.

261
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:42,593
Well, it's...
Oh...

262
00:11:44,469 --> 00:11:45,902
Thank you.
Thank you.

263
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,929
Some couples don't seem like
a good match, but you two do.

264
00:11:50,007 --> 00:11:51,235
Well, you know.

265
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,937
Yeah, you know,
two peas in a pod.

266
00:11:54,011 --> 00:11:55,638
We complete
each other.

267
00:11:55,713 --> 00:11:57,408
What can I say?
She loves to cook...

268
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:59,109
He loves to eat.

269
00:11:59,617 --> 00:12:00,845
I love to dance...

270
00:12:00,918 --> 00:12:02,078
I love to watch
him dance.

271
00:12:02,153 --> 00:12:05,316
Yeah, right. Sometimes I'll just
dance for hours in the living room.

272
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,617
And I'll watch him.

273
00:12:06,691 --> 00:12:09,489
And a baby on the way?
You must be so excited.

274
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,050
Mmm.
Yes.

275
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:13,359
Yeah, we are thrilled.
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:14,921
In fact, we spent
the whole weekend

277
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:17,263
researching various
birthing coaches.

278
00:12:17,335 --> 00:12:18,324
Wasn't that
fun, honey?

279
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:19,528
It was, sweetie.
Yeah.

280
00:12:19,604 --> 00:12:22,505
Oh, I know the best teacher.
Her name is Miss Janet.

281
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:23,801
Yeah, on Clearview Avenue.

282
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:24,899
Yeah!

283
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:26,068
Yeah.

284
00:12:26,777 --> 00:12:31,544
This sounds ridiculous, I know, but some
people say that I eat like a squirrel.

285
00:12:31,616 --> 00:12:35,143
So now you're comparing
yourself to a cute, tiny animal?

286
00:12:36,354 --> 00:12:37,378
Michael?
Hmm?

287
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:41,050
The custodian called again.
Apparently a koi has died.

288
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,217
Oh, man!

289
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,317
It's a fish.

290
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:45,291
They want you
to pay for it.

291
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:46,955
It could have died of
natural causes, though.

292
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:50,728
Well, they said you stepped
on its head. He did not suffer.

293
00:12:52,236 --> 00:12:53,567
When is the funeral?

294
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:56,106
Do not mock, Oscar.
Do not mock.

295
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,005
How much do they want?
$300.

296
00:12:58,075 --> 00:13:01,704
What? No. I could get a
fish for a five-cent worm.

297
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:05,772
You're paying way too much for
worms, man. Who's your worm guy?

298
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,047
Okay, great meeting,
everybody. That's it. No, no.

299
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,453
Thank you. No, we are
not done here. This...

300
00:13:14,926 --> 00:13:16,018
One of the baby
books suggests

301
00:13:16,093 --> 00:13:19,426
the best birthing posture is
on all fours, like an animal.

302
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,124
I just wish I had
a special telephone

303
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:24,362
so I could find out exactly
what the little soybean wants.

304
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:27,563
Right? Hey, little
soybean. What do you want?

305
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,731
Right? How do...

306
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,307
I felt it kick.
Oh, that's great!

307
00:13:34,378 --> 00:13:37,541
Oh, my gosh, like a little
magical foot just high-fived me.

308
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,014
Yeah, well,
that'll happen.

309
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:40,414
Oh, my gosh.

310
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:44,285
It's like he's trying to say,
"I love you, too, Daddy.

311
00:13:44,355 --> 00:13:45,515
"I love you, too."

312
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,717
Sometimes we're so excited,
we forget where we are.

313
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,986
Like at a business meeting.

314
00:13:51,896 --> 00:13:53,921
Message received,
little soybean.

315
00:13:54,165 --> 00:13:55,598
I think you just got to
ride this one out, man.

316
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,964
No, Jim, you don't understand.

317
00:13:58,035 --> 00:14:00,128
Things like this
just don't die.

318
00:14:00,905 --> 00:14:03,840
Kids in high school still call
me "Ponytail." No, they don't.

319
00:14:03,908 --> 00:14:06,468
Yes, they do, Jim.
Because of the time

320
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:09,069
I got my ponytail
stuck in the power drill.

321
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,774
Maybe if you make fun of
yourself, it'll all go away.

322
00:14:11,849 --> 00:14:13,111
I want to make fun
of you right now.

323
00:14:13,184 --> 00:14:17,621
Really? Do it. I am a
big, stupid goofball.

324
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:20,282
No, don't do that.
You're not stupid.

325
00:14:21,692 --> 00:14:22,750
See?

326
00:14:24,028 --> 00:14:25,120
Oh, my God.

327
00:14:25,496 --> 00:14:30,798
Hey, I just want to say
that I cannot believe

328
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,699
that I walked
into a koi pond.

329
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,965
I mean, seriously,
walk much?

330
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,134
Oh!

331
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,302
I should wear a snorkel to the
next business meeting that I go to.

332
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:43,279
Michael, you know, when you think
about it, it's not all your fault.

333
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:45,212
I mean, who puts
a koi pond in a lobby?

334
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,012
Well,
you know what?

335
00:14:47,084 --> 00:14:50,053
You're right, Phyllis,
but I've been there before.

336
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:52,385
I've seen that pond.
This is the thing,

337
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,356
I am a world-class moron,
is the problem.

338
00:14:54,425 --> 00:14:56,985
Michael, please stop it now.
You're embarrassing yourself.

339
00:14:57,061 --> 00:14:58,392
It's okay.
We're having fun.

340
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,625
It's actually not the first time
I've been embarrassed by a pond.

341
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,891
In high school,

342
00:15:03,968 --> 00:15:06,903
the girls volleyball team always
used to throw me into the frozen lake.

343
00:15:06,971 --> 00:15:08,734
Four years in a row.

344
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:15,371
It was freezing! No, no,
no. This is even worse.

345
00:15:15,746 --> 00:15:18,237
Couple of weeks ago, I
went to get a new cell phone

346
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:19,874
and I wanted one
of those packages

347
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,144
where you have
the five, you know,

348
00:15:21,218 --> 00:15:23,209
the friends
and family thing?

349
00:15:23,287 --> 00:15:25,312
And the guy was like, "Who
are your five friends?"

350
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:28,119
And I'm like...
I didn't even know.

351
00:15:28,192 --> 00:15:32,322
I couldn't even think. Oh, my
God, it was so embarrassing.

352
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,320
That was so...

353
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:38,360
I don't even have Jan's cell
phone number, and I hate her.

354
00:15:39,036 --> 00:15:42,972
She won't give it to me. I was
like, "I guess I'm a loser."

355
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:46,969
A loser!

356
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:49,777
Too far! God!

357
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:54,378
Thanks a lot, man.
Thanks for the advice.

358
00:16:03,894 --> 00:16:05,418
Enjoying your nut?

359
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:06,485
Why?
- Kevin.

360
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:07,553
I'm not mocking.

361
00:16:07,631 --> 00:16:11,226
I was just making an
observation about her nut.

362
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:12,860
I was.

363
00:16:12,937 --> 00:16:15,735
Hey, who wants to watch
Michael's pond dive?

364
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:19,367
My roommate's friend is the
night janitor over there.

365
00:16:19,443 --> 00:16:23,106
He swiped the security tape for
me, and he's bringing it over.

366
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:26,980
Mmm. You know what? Maybe we
should go easy on Michael, guys.

367
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,075
You know,
you watch that tape,

368
00:16:28,152 --> 00:16:31,747
and you're going to have to stay late
for more sensitivity training, so.

369
00:16:31,822 --> 00:16:33,722
We'll stay late.
Yeah.

370
00:16:35,326 --> 00:16:37,419
You are not a joke.

371
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,519
I am.

372
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:39,654
You are smart.

373
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:40,754
Jim is smarter than me.

374
00:16:40,831 --> 00:16:42,799
You are handsome.
Jim is more handsome.

375
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:47,770
No, Jim is ugly. Please. I mean, I'd
give anything for his nose. It's true.

376
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:50,432
The rest of him, God,
he looks like Popeye's wife.

377
00:16:50,508 --> 00:16:52,442
Wow, Wilma.

378
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:55,244
See, that is funny.
That is a joke.

379
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:57,940
I know jokes
and you are not a joke.

380
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,383
Her name's not Wilma.

381
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:03,217
Stop making me laugh.

382
00:17:03,654 --> 00:17:04,712
Well, that went
pretty well.

383
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:05,778
Yeah, I guess.

384
00:17:05,856 --> 00:17:07,881
We got a maybe.
It was our first maybe.

385
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:10,927
Going by the Nard-Dog curve,
I'd say we nailed it.

386
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:11,984
If I'm being
completely honest,

387
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:13,689
I could have done
without the belly kiss.

388
00:17:13,764 --> 00:17:15,322
You know what?
I'm sorry,

389
00:17:15,399 --> 00:17:18,664
'cause in that moment, I knew I
was kissing your belly too much.

390
00:17:18,736 --> 00:17:20,135
Yeah, way too much.
Yeah.

391
00:17:20,204 --> 00:17:21,967
I mean, what the hell was that?

392
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:23,438
What the heck was that?

393
00:17:23,507 --> 00:17:24,496
When you cried.

394
00:17:24,575 --> 00:17:27,100
Try "almost cried." Okay?

395
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:29,112
I just got caught
up in the fantasy.

396
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:32,411
Your fantasy involves comparison
shopping birthing classes?

397
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:35,748
No. I know I'm going
to go with Miss Janet.

398
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,153
I just... I don't know, it
was fun to role-play, right?

399
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:40,247
Hmm.

400
00:17:40,324 --> 00:17:43,760
It was fun for me, having
a wife and a little baby.

401
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:47,227
I'm so sick of
being single.

402
00:17:47,298 --> 00:17:49,596
Well, are you
dating anyone?

403
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:53,398
What do you think of Erin?
I mean, she's kind of cool.

404
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:56,398
You think
I can do better?

405
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:00,569
Got to get my
going out on.

406
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:02,835
Hey, let's watch
this thing.

407
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:04,380
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
okay, yeah.

408
00:18:04,448 --> 00:18:05,540
We're not watching this.

409
00:18:05,616 --> 00:18:06,981
How can we
not watch this?

410
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,541
What happened
to "Do not mock"?

411
00:18:08,619 --> 00:18:10,052
We're not mocking,
we're watching.

412
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:12,088
That will inevitably
lead to mocking, so.

413
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,418
Well, we'll
deal with it as it comes.

414
00:18:13,491 --> 00:18:14,651
Is this the tape
of me falling?

415
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:15,817
Yes, put the DVD in.
Yep.

416
00:18:15,893 --> 00:18:17,292
Open up QuickTime.
It starts on its own.

417
00:18:17,361 --> 00:18:19,226
No, use QuickTime,
trust me, I've done this.

418
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:21,355
Guys, Michael
can't handle this.

419
00:18:21,432 --> 00:18:23,764
And as your boss, I'm
saying, we're not watching it.

420
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:26,496
No, it's okay, watch it.
He can't fire all of you.

421
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,594
What are you doing?

422
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:29,104
It's all right.
I can handle it.

423
00:18:29,173 --> 00:18:30,504
No.
I am a grownup, Jim.

424
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:31,563
It's on.

425
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:32,631
There they come.

426
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:36,043
Boom!

427
00:18:36,113 --> 00:18:37,808
Oh! Did you see that? See what?

428
00:18:37,882 --> 00:18:39,144
Wait, why did
you stop it?

429
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:40,945
Oscar, yes, you're right to stop it.

430
00:18:41,018 --> 00:18:42,280
Thank you, eject it.

431
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:44,150
Jim, you let
Michael fall in.

432
00:18:44,221 --> 00:18:45,347
Play it again.

433
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,551
He purposefully
leaned away and let you fall.

434
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,854
Oh, man!

435
00:18:56,867 --> 00:19:00,166
I think when I started to see
you go in, I think I just froze.

436
00:19:00,237 --> 00:19:02,205
I don't think
you froze.

437
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,973
It's a killer
new dance move.

438
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:10,406
Do you want
to talk in your office?

439
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:11,505
No.

440
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:15,582
I didn't ask you.
Would you like to talk?

441
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,586
Judas.

442
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:21,352
Jim is my enemy,
but it turns out

443
00:19:21,425 --> 00:19:23,552
that Jim is also
his own worst enemy.

444
00:19:23,627 --> 00:19:28,257
And the enemy of my enemy is my
friend, so Jim is actually my friend.

445
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:33,067
But, because he is
his own worst enemy,

446
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:34,934
the enemy of my
friend is my enemy,

447
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,132
so actually
Jim is my enemy.

448
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:38,964
But...

449
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:42,140
I should have
grabbed you. I'm sorry.

450
00:19:43,213 --> 00:19:47,013
Look, I thought I could have
done today's sales call alone.

451
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:49,611
I mean, I may never be as
good a salesman as you are,

452
00:19:49,687 --> 00:19:52,679
but I at least need
the chance to do the job.

453
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:56,055
Jim is jealous of me?

454
00:19:59,396 --> 00:20:01,193
Jim is jealous of me.

455
00:20:05,302 --> 00:20:06,894
Hey, what's up,
lifeguard?

456
00:20:06,971 --> 00:20:08,939
Jim, I think
I'm in your way.

457
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,506
Oscar's a douche.

458
00:20:20,084 --> 00:20:21,483
He's all right.
No.

459
00:20:21,552 --> 00:20:23,816
He's... Yeah,
he's all right.

460
00:20:26,557 --> 00:20:27,649
Okay.

461
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:33,557
Thanks, Michael.
You're welcome.

462
00:20:33,831 --> 00:20:36,129
Whoa! Almost fell.

463
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:44,931
Hey, Erin, do you mind
faxing this for me? Oh, sure.

464
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,738
Wait, hand them
to me upside down,

465
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:49,244
so I don't accidentally read them.

466
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,104
Okay.
Thanks.

467
00:20:51,181 --> 00:20:52,205
Mmm-hmm.

468
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,944
How did today go, by the way?
Did you make any sales?

469
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:57,419
No, it was a total
waste of time.

470
00:21:00,624 --> 00:21:01,682
It was fun, though,

471
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,317
because I got
to spend the day

472
00:21:03,394 --> 00:21:05,658
with Andy Bernard
and he's really cool.

473
00:21:05,729 --> 00:21:07,094
Yeah, he is.

474
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:08,461
Yeah, he is.

475
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,693
He's like the coolest
person I've ever met.

476
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,633
That's right.

477
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,705
He's like Marlon Brando.

478
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:21,843
Oh, do you mean Marlon
Wayans? 'Cause he is.

479
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,081
I actually do mean
Marlon Wayans. Yeah.
