1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:05,963
Val, I need the space

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,965
All right
guys, clear out

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,008
Everybody out

4
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:10,300
Promise me you're
going to clean up.

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:12,636
What I'm going
to do or not do

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,721
Promise me

7
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:15,097
Obviously
I'm going to clean up

8
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:18,058
Stress is like the uptight
mayor of a town who's saying

9
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,310
"Hey, we're uptight
You can't dance."

10
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:24,106
And then, you have to be like "Oh,
yeah, Mayor Stress? Well, watch this.'

11
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:26,442
And then, we dance.

12
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:30,320
Oh, how we dance.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,732
Sex also works

14
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,299
Hey, Jim's back
from jury duty.

15
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,844
Hey! Tuna
He's back

16
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,387
Hey

17
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,430
Oh, look at this

18
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,265
Tuna wrap
Okay

19
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,060
Hand roll

20
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,937
How was jury duty?

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,480
Pretty uneventful
actually.

22
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,774
Let someone like you
serve on a jury

23
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,818
Makes me question
the whole judicial system

24
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,111
What was the case?

25
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,278
A hit and run

26
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,781
Ooh! The case of the hit and run.
That's exciting.

27
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,199
Did you send him
to the slammer?

28
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,826
No. Not guilty

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,536
Of course you
found him not guilty

30
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:04,540
He apologized And I just really
want him to like me. Mmm!

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,333
We're best friends
actually.

32
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,460
We're going wine tasting next
weekend if you want to come

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,837
Not coming
Have plans.

34
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,130
Okay

35
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,423
I did get called
into jury duty

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,384
And they
released me around noon

37
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,469
so I didn't
think it was worth it

38
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,596
to come back to work
for a half day.

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,641
And then the next morning, Pam was
a little overwhelmed with the kids

40
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,227
so I took an extra day
to help out.

41
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,689
And then
three other days happened

42
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,732
Ah

43
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,734
Angela had the baby

44
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,863
Is it black? Because
that would be hilarious

45
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,030
Why?

46
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,116
You know

47
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,077
Would it be more hilarious than
Angela having a Chinese baby?

48
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:45,914
A little bit. Yeah.
Right, guys? Back me up

49
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:47,875
Maybe a little bit

50
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,710
Oh. Did I win the pool?

51
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:52,296
Uh, no Right month wrong year.

52
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,465
No one won the pool Angela
wasn't due for another month.

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,509
We should all go to
the hospital and visit her

54
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,720
Oh, I'd love to, but

55
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,347
Oh, man, I would, but I
can't miss any more work

56
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:05,934
Well, Kevin and I have to go because
accounting is its own little family.

57
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:10,814
Yeah, Oscar's the dad I'm Oscar's
dad and Angela's my mom.

58
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,650
Everyone,
our very own Angela

59
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,777
We all got the e-mail Some
of us are going to go visit

60
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,529
Oh, I am so in

61
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,201
It's the perfect blend
of love and horror

62
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,037
Things can go so
wrong or so right

63
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,334
Come on, Judge Judy tell us your case.
What were the deets?

64
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:32,044
It was actually
a pretty boring case

65
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,172
How could it be boring? You were
there for five days Titillate us

66
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,508
Yeah, you owe us. I had to stay
until 6:00 twice to cover for you.

67
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,385
My wife got to
the TV first.

68
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,055
I had to sit through damn
Rizzoli & damn Isles.

69
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,933
Yeah. My car got smashed
visiting one of your clients

70
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:49,019
and I had to have it detailed
and they took my meter change

71
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,395
Wow. I'm really sorry

72
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,521
Yeah

73
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,857
I never considered
that my week off

74
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,443
would make everyone
else's job harder

75
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,655
The least I could do
was give them a good story

76
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,907
So Phyllis
he was here and then

77
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,576
the car came and
it was like that.

78
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,745
Yeah, so it had to be a
double backflip, actually

79
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,374
You know when I was on
J-duties strangler case,

80
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,337
we used to recreate the various
stranglings with empanadas from Ernesto's

81
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,172
Oh, man, Ernesto's

82
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,882
That was our
favorite restaurant, too

83
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,218
You mean food truck
Ernesto's was a food truck

84
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:22,844
Toby, shut your hole
about the empanadas

85
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,763
Nobody cares
about the empanadas

86
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,556
I was in Los Angeles
last year

87
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:30,102
Jim tricked me into thinking I'd
won a walk-on part on NCIS,

88
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:31,144
but that's not important

89
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,773
While I was being kicked off the
lot, I saw food trucks everywhere

90
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,733
Everyone in Los Angeles
eats from them

91
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:39,820
and nobody calls
them restaurants

92
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:49,621
Guys, I don't know how
many of you have seen

93
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,456
Gabe, bring it in

94
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,459
how many of you have seen
a premature baby before.

95
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,421
It's going to be really tiny so
please don't say anything offensive

96
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,047
Got that, bimbo?

97
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,632
Got it, bimbo

98
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:02,884
Yes?

99
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,012
Knock, knock.

100
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,722
Hi.
- Uh

101
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,477
I don't want What are
you guys doing here?

102
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,855
We wanted to say hi to the
newest little Dunder Mifflinite

103
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:20,527
Well, meet our not-so-little bundle
of joy Philip Halsted Lipton

104
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,154
Philip is so fat

105
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,363
Kevin

106
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,866
You warned me not to say
anything if it was tiny, Oscar

107
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,827
You didn't prepare me
for a big, giant, fat baby

108
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,746
Yes, he's substantial
Hey

109
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,749
He's more than substantial
He's a monster.

110
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,003
So this whole
hit and run thing

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,005
there's this one part
I can't figure out.

112
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,548
You said it was
at a four-way stop?

113
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:42,632
Mmm-hmm

114
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,803
And the victim rode his bicycle
into the left-hand turn lane

115
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,598
but the perp was already in
the left-hand turn lane?

116
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:50,932
Mmm-hmm

117
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:54,770
See, that's what I'm having
trouble with, because the fact is

118
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,482
you never said he
was on a bicycle.

119
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:05,364
Busted, Halpert! Yes
Wait. No

120
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,615
Andy, get out here

121
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:07,824
was on a bicycle

122
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,242
wasn't listening to you

123
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,577
a citizen's arrest

124
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,912
You have the right
to remain silent.

125
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:13,205
You have the right
to beg for mercy.

126
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,333
You have the right to request
judgment by combat Dwight's rights

127
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:17,876
What's up, gangsters?

128
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:20,712
Jim was lying
about jury duty

129
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,132
He was lying the whole time so he
could go do yoga or go canoeing,

130
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,718
I don't know what this pervert likes.
Fire him!

131
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,888
Dwight, not everything
is a conspiracy theory

132
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:33,433
saying that the victim...

133
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,644
Dwight I have me on the record

134
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,855
saying to you take a
chill pill all right?

135
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,482
I don't need to
take a chill pill

136
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,817
Here, right there

137
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,905
Down the hatch

138
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,783
I really don't want
to take a chill pill.

139
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:53,453
That a boy, good
Now, chill.

140
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,538
Okay, okay

141
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,211
But let's just say that Jim
was lying about jury duty

142
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,879
you would have to
fire him, right?

143
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,591
Yeah, sure. Of course.
I'd fire him to Timbuktu

144
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,759
Ha-ha

145
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,179
Good enough for me

146
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,390
Ah

147
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,438
And Pam was just going crazy
trying to take care of Philip

148
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,857
because Cece has been
out of control recently.

149
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,611
Look, Andy, it doesn't matter The truth
is I just feel terrible lying to you.

150
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,030
Getting lied to

151
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,366
No one's ever
lied to me before

152
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,453
Okay

153
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,371
I think the best
thing to do right now

154
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,248
is just come clean
and tell everybody

155
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:41,126
No. Not after what I told
Dwight about firing you. No

156
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,210
Here's what
we're going to do

157
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,880
We're going to have ourselves
a good old fashioned cover-up

158
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,258
You ever heard of a
Connecticut cover up? No

159
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,343
You know why you
never heard of it?

160
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:51,470
Covered it up

161
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,514
Are you sure you can
keep this under wraps?

162
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,433
They used to
call me King Tut

163
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,102
because I'm so good at
keeping things under wraps

164
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,855
My nickname was
actually King Butt

165
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,690
because I had
a king-sized butt

166
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:13,742
Where do you
want it parked?

167
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:18,663
Okay, everybody
Gather round.

168
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,790
Got a real special
surprise for you

169
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,083
Ernesto

170
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,793
Hola, Toby!

171
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:34,137
Uh, I'm going to say "I"
when I'm talking for Ernesto

172
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,473
so instead of,
"He says blah, blah, blah, '

173
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,434
I'm going to say, "I say blah,
blah, blah, ' but that's for him.

174
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,396
Anyway, it was something
like he remembers Toby.

175
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,232
"I remember Toby.'

176
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,736
Oh, Jim. Hey, this
guy look familiar?

177
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,363
It's the empanada guy

178
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,572
The empanada guy

179
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:56,117
Holy *. Damn it, Toby
No, I wasn't asking you.

180
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,745
Ask him if he
remembers Jim

181
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,751
No

182
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,169
He says no

183
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,504
He says no. Boom

184
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:09,130
Yeah, but who remembers
all their customers?

185
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,341
I mean, I can name
like three of our clients

186
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,469
He remembers Toby the most
forgettable man in the known world

187
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,684
He doesn't want
any trouble.

188
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,352
He sees lots of people

189
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,272
they come from all around to eat
his delicious meat pockets.

190
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:29,484
Uh, you guys are going to love
these, so empanadas on me

191
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:30,569
You guys got to try them

192
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:34,906
Usually I'm a burrito guy but if you
won't tell, I won't. Wink, wink.

193
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,784
Great And while we're enjoying
these delicious empanadas

194
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,161
Jim, why don't you
tell us your story again?

195
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,329
Why? Everybody's heard it

196
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,123
Walk us through it

197
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,666
What time would you get
there every morning?

198
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,751
Hey, Murder, She Wrote,

199
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:50,380
how about we drop the whole
Murder, She Wrote thing, okay?

200
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,425
Jim was at the courthouse
for jury duty every morning

201
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:56,177
How do I know?
Because I drove him there

202
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,763
Why?
Why?

203
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,390
Why?

204
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,685
Because my car broke down

205
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,770
His car broke down
so he called me

206
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:06,938
because I live
near the courthouse

207
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,983
Wait, wait,
you live by the courthouse

208
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:13,445
You drove from near the
courthouse out to Jim's house

209
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:14,988
and then back to
the courthouse?

210
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,616
Thirty minutes out 30
minutes back easy hour.

211
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,492
And I would watch
that cute, little tooshy

212
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:21,828
scurry up those courthouse
stairs every morning

213
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,580
and that was that

214
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:28,043
I'm sorry, do you have
any American Mexican food?

215
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,295
We're getting
buried out there

216
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,005
What was that stuff about
the car breaking down?

217
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,882
Well, I think you
handled it pretty well

218
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:37,427
I'm not Rumpelstiltskin, Jim, I can't
keep spinning gold out of your *

219
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,137
Okay, listen, all right?

220
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,431
Dwight's onto us. He's going
to figure it out really soon

221
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,350
So let's just get ahead of it.
Let's tell the truth

222
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,478
I don't even know what
the truth is anymore.

223
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,813
Wow, it's so

224
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,815
healthy

225
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,443
I'm going to call
him Little Kevin

226
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,903
No, you will not

227
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,323
Is he really five pounds? Because
I squat with five pounds

228
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,949
This

229
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:02,369
Yeah, this feels like
more than that

230
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:05,080
No, no, no he's nine
pounds seven ounces.

231
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,916
Nine pounds? Really?

232
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,836
I thought you said five You know what?
I was under so many drugs

233
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:15,632
a James Taylor concert
or something

234
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:17,801
So, what did you bring?

235
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,970
Oh, yeah, I don't know
if it's right, but...

236
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:24,349
Well, if it's anything like
that gorgeous wrapping paper

237
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,517
you hit it
out of the park

238
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:27,894
Oh

239
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,729
Preemie pajamas

240
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:31,523
Again, it may not be
the right size, I can

241
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,984
No, I think he came early
just so he could wear these

242
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,194
Thank you

243
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:38,697
Call of Duty.

244
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,241
This baby is
clearly not premature

245
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,201
They're lying about
the date it was conceived

246
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,161
It's very interesting

247
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:49,332
And her husband's gay I don't
even know which thread to follow.

248
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,677
Uh, excuse me, can I have
everyone's attention for a second?

249
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,512
First off, I just want to
say that I'm really sorry

250
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,389
I didn't know that
my absence last week

251
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:06,224
would have been
a burden on any of you

252
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,394
Because, though I did
have jury duty last week,

253
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,981
they did dismiss me
early on Monday.

254
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,818
And I think you're going to
find this pretty hilarious.

255
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:20,864
I kind of, well
maybe took the week off

256
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:23,241
What?

257
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,368
Funny? No? Nobody laughed

258
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,455
You're screwed

259
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:32,459
Oh! It's happening.
It's really happening

260
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,295
What the hell, Jim I
covered for your bony butt

261
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,589
Pam really needed some help
with the kids, so...

262
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,174
I promise my
intentions were good

263
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,884
Your clients,
they're all mine

264
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:45,305
Jim, I got my ass chewed out because
one of your orders got messed up.

265
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,766
And Andy, you said you drove
him to the courthouse

266
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,058
Uh, I did

267
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:53,188
Every morning And if I
didn't then I hope I die

268
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:58,026
All right, well, let's get this
show on the road, shall we?

269
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,029
Allow me to give you
a hand Here we are.

270
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:03,239
So long, clump mate

271
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,575
I'm going to miss you
Truth be told,

272
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,328
I never thought that this
was how it was going to end

273
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,455
I was going to
defeat you somehow

274
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,664
but you've
defeated yourself

275
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,876
Dwight, cut it out
I'm not firing Jim.

276
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,628
No, no, no, no
you said...

277
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,463
ANDY
I know what I said

278
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,634
Jim, you're in deep
doo-doo you understand?

279
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,010
And I have one
thing to say to you

280
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,304
and I'm going to say it in
front of this whole office

281
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:27,722
Look me in the eye

282
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,477
That's it?

283
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,313
This is crap

284
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,068
You've reached Gabe Lewis.
I'm currently indisposed.

285
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,070
Leave me a message. Ciao.

286
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,321
Gabe, it's Dwight again

287
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:45,490
Highest priority
triple urgent.

288
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,159
Call me immediately
That means ASAP

289
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:50,662
I'm going to find Gabe
tell him what Jim did

290
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,748
and let the little stickler
do what he does best, stickle

291
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,418
Honestly, I can return
this for a larger size

292
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,421
It's fine Pajamas aren't
supposed to be baggy, right?

293
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,756
It's not the barrio

294
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,594
The only premature baby in this
room is the baby this baby ate

295
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,807
Little Kevin

296
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,725
Really?
Angela

297
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,269
Fine. God

298
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,896
Philip was conceived
nine months ago.

299
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,817
The Senator and I
wanted to wait

300
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,194
but we had just seen Thor,

301
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,697
and there was way too much
wine in my chicken piccata

302
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,532
Chicken marsala
Right

303
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:31,202
And, the point is, Philip was
conceived out of wedlock

304
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,370
Hmm

305
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:35,707
And now you all know
but you can never tell

306
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,584
I'm serious

307
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,461
Dwight

308
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,671
Hey

309
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:42,839
Oh. Hey, have you
seen Gabe?

310
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,091
He went to the car or
something but he'll be back.

311
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,467
Okay

312
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:50,889
Don't you want
to see the baby?

313
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,309
Why? I know what Angela
and the Senator look like

314
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,728
I can mash that up
in my head right now

315
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,065
wouldn't tell

316
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,358
So don't

317
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:06,070
Angela got pregnant
before the wedding.

318
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,365
What?

319
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,742
She got pregnant
before the wedding

320
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,493
How long before?
A month

321
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,293
You didn't hear it
from me

322
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,753
Yes, I did

323
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,051
Dwight?
Dwight.

324
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,180
Well, Angela will make you cut
your fingernails It's not worth it

325
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,098
Oh

326
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,600
Yes

327
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,518
Oh

328
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:42,482
What a beautiful child Prominent
forehead, short arms, tiny nose.

329
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,860
You will lead millions

330
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,863
willingly or as slaves

331
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:53,368
That baby is a Schrute, and
unless somebody taught Mose sex

332
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,370
that baby is mine

333
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,289
He's hungry

334
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,458
Oh, that's my cue
to leave.

335
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,251
No, you don't have to I'm
going to wear this cover.

336
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:05,254
Still

337
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,464
You won't be seeing

338
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:09,884
Do you want the giraffe?

339
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,887
Yes, I am bringing my kids in to
help me get out of this hole.

340
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,722
And you all remember
my beautiful wife, Pam

341
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,848
Hi

342
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,810
Wow, I really thought I'd
be more excited to be here

343
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,687
Whoa, whoa, whoa Game face, baby.
Game face

344
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:21,813
Oh, right. Okay

345
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,606
Hey, Stanley
it's great to see you

346
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,649
No, that's overdoing it I think.

347
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:26,818
Hi, Stanley.
Split the difference

348
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,569
Jim.
Okay. Let's go

349
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,029
Hi

350
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,824
Hi, everybody

351
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,492
What?
Oh, hi

352
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,952
How about
a little visit?

353
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,997
Wow. What a surprise
That's crazy

354
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:40,999
You guys get to meet
the little heck raisers

355
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,750
Hey, Angela's back
with her baby.

356
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,502
Yes, well, you guys
all know Cece,

357
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,587
but we wanted to introduce
you to baby Philip.

358
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,717
You guys

359
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,013
He's licking on my finger
just like my cat does.

360
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,222
Let me have a turn

361
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,348
No, it's
the pacifier's turn

362
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:58,474
All right

363
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,184
Did you say
something about

364
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,438
this one bringing in
something for these people?

365
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,691
Yes. Cece wanted
to thank everybody

366
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:10,236
for letting her daddy stay home
with her all last week and play

367
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,904
so she brought
you a little treat

368
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,156
Oh, cookies?

369
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,782
No. But that would have
been a really good idea

370
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,867
That would have
been really good

371
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,619
No, she
brought you drawings

372
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,205
Oh, my goodness,
let's take a look at these

373
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,918
They're usually amazing so let's see.
Yep, they are

374
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,378
Uncle Andy

375
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,504
Oh

376
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,839
Aunt Phyllis

377
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:33,092
Wow. These are incredible
Cece, did you do these?

378
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,218
No

379
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,972
She says no to everything. You
know, she thinks my name is "No.'

380
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,891
Cece, do you want
some broccoli?

381
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:40,975
Yes

382
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,060
No

383
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,936
It's crazy

384
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,647
Why am I shorter than the table
that I'm standing next to?

385
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,817
ANDY There is crosshatching
in some of these

386
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,736
That's kind of advanced
for a 2-year-old.

387
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:54,447
Cece, this is your
big sister, Kelly

388
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,407
Did you color
this pretty picture?

389
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,533
No

390
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,827
So then this
means nothing to you?

391
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,663
Hey, Cece

392
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,460
why don't you draw another picture
for us exactly like this one

393
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,588
or at least in
the exact same style?

394
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,841
You know what? I don't think you
need to do things on command.

395
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,761
That's very weird Just take that.
Thank you.

396
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,014
I think we should just wrap
up the show kiddos, right?

397
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,308
Else we can do here

398
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:24,769
Okay. All right

399
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,562
It's okay, sweetie
All right

400
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,272
All right. Okay

401
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,693
It's okay

402
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,487
Shh

403
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:41,119
Angela, this child is definitely mine.
He looks just like me

404
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,912
Every baby
looks just like you

405
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,372
Your face kind of
looks like a baby

406
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:48,960
Need I remind you that we were
together a month before the wedding?

407
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,129
That is completely untrue

408
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,213
Completely true

409
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,297
No
Remember?

410
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,258
You said that Robert
was not fulfilling you

411
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,676
And I said that I
could fulfill you

412
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,052
and you said
"I'd like to see you try.'

413
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,304
And then I kissed you with the
force of a thousand waterfalls

414
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,722
That didn't happen

415
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,391
Then I inserted my
penis into your...

416
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,017
No! Stop it! Dwight

417
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,227
...vagina and

418
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,520
And even if it did,
it's just a coincidence

419
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:09,147
Admit that there is a chance.
I will not

420
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,273
Admit it
I will not

421
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,274
It's not

422
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,568
All done?
Yes

423
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,236
Yes. He's sleeping

424
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,071
Before I go, may I?

425
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,573
Sure

426
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,826
Watch the head
Watch the head

427
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,588
Nurse! You know that baby in there?
Baby Philip?

428
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,131
Cancel the circumcision

429
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,215
Who are you?

430
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,764
What that means

431
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,434
We're going to
circumcise him

432
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:49,854
Cece, want to come?

433
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:50,897
No

434
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,523
Want to come play?
Oh, bud, I know.

435
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,566
Do you have a pacifier?

436
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,610
Yeah. I'm looking I'm
looking for the pacifier.

437
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,695
Cece
Okay, we're going

438
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,114
We got to go All right,
we're going home

439
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,951
I know

440
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,830
You gotta grab her
I'll go grab her. Okay

441
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,249
Okay. Here we go
Here we go.

442
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,752
Okay, I'm just going to go down to
the car, and I'm going to put her

443
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,629
in her seat and
I'll be right back up

444
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,548
We'll see you tomorrow

445
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:18,758
No, no, it's okay
I'll be right back.

446
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,926
No, just go home

447
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,053
It's all good
We got this.

448
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,765
Last week
Jim at home

449
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,976
that was no vacation

450
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,561
Jim, just go

451
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,605
Hey, we'll be just fine

452
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,900
Thanks, guys

453
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,653
All right, here we go
Let's go

454
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,155
Oh!

455
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,448
Phew

456
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,043
Dwight, what the hell?

457
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,712
You can't smoke in here

458
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,297
Oh, all right

459
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,258
Ah

460
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,635
The office looks
different now Mmm

461
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,053
Smaller

462
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,722
Maybe I just feel bigger

463
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,099
Hello, Gabe

464
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,308
You had something
important to tell me?

465
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,522
Oh. You know, I did but now it
seems infinitely insignificant

466
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,901
Jim? Oh, right
No, forget it.

467
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,487
He was doing it for
his kids I get it

468
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,115
Kids drive us dads crazy.

469
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,908
Sometimes I feel
like they're raising us.

470
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,618
Am I right?
