1
00:00:02,402 --> 00:00:04,403
Tonight the Scranton Business
Park is having Casino Night.

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,305
And we are converting
our warehouse

3
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:07,873
into a full-blown
gambling hall.

4
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:11,043
And I know it's illegal
in Pennsylvania.

5
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,611
But it's for charity.

6
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:15,581
And I consider myself
a great philanderer.

7
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,850
It's just nice to know
at the end of the day

8
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,351
I can look in the mirror
and say,

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,453
"Michael, because of you,

10
00:00:21,455 --> 00:00:23,455
"some little kid in the Congo

11
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:26,225
has a bellyful of rice
this evening."

12
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:29,361
Just... makes you feel good.

13
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,632
Ahem.

14
00:00:38,104 --> 00:00:39,271
Excuse me.

15
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:41,774
How long is the wait
for a table for two?

16
00:00:41,776 --> 00:00:44,843
I would never, ever serve you.

17
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:47,546
Not in a million, billion years.

18
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,148
It's a nice tux.

19
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:51,550
I know. It belonged
to my grandfather.

20
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,821
He was buried in it,
so... family heirloom.

21
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:00,092
So what's the deal?

22
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,093
We've gotta pay
for our own drinks?

23
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,828
That's lame.
Come on, it'll be fun.

24
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:04,596
And besides,
I'm a roulette expert.

25
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:07,366
Impossible.
Roulette is not a game of skill.

26
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,068
It is a game of chance.

27
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,270
I can always kind
of win at roulette.

28
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:12,838
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm?

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,339
How would you do that?

30
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,675
Mind control.

31
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,777
You can't be serious.

32
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:21,747
Are you serious?

33
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,816
Ever since I was little kid,

34
00:01:23,818 --> 00:01:25,451
like eight or nine,

35
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,287
I could sort of control
things with my mind.

36
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:30,889
I don't believe you.
Continue.

37
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,357
It was just
little things, you know.

38
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:33,559
Like I could make
something shake.

39
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:35,260
Or I could make a marble
fall off the counter.

40
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,663
You know, just little things.

41
00:01:37,665 --> 00:01:40,332
Heh!
That's ridiculous.

42
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:42,401
You know what? Uh...

43
00:01:42,403 --> 00:01:45,304
Why don't you move
that coat rack?

44
00:01:45,306 --> 00:01:46,672
Excuse me, everyone!

45
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:48,440
Attention in the office, please.

46
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:51,710
Jim is about to prove
his telekinetic powers.

47
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:53,679
And he needs absolute silence.

48
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:54,847
Go ahead.

49
00:01:54,849 --> 00:01:57,483
Okay. I'll try.

50
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:26,812
Oh, my God.

51
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:08,687
I try not to think of it
as lagging behind.

52
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,356
It's more of a David
and Goliath thing.

53
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,025
Well, the fact of the matter is,

54
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,526
that your branch is
currently number four

55
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,295
of the five branches
that I oversee.

56
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,330
Top 80%.

57
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,831
Michael...
Yep?

58
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,867
You know that
I'm very serious here.

59
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,836
Jan, listen. I promise I will
kick it up a notch.

60
00:03:24,838 --> 00:03:26,004
Bam!

61
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:27,372
What?

62
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:30,409
Emeril. Oh, actually,
while I have you...

63
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:32,578
Not that I have you
or have ever had you.

64
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,880
But we're having
our Casino Night tonight,

65
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:36,615
and I think everyone
would love to see

66
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,916
their fearless leader here.

67
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:40,485
I thought that you were
their fearless leader.

68
00:03:40,487 --> 00:03:45,791
I am, but you are my Eva Perón
to my César Chávez.

69
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,561
I, um, think you can
handle it probably, Michael.

70
00:03:49,563 --> 00:03:52,798
Oh, come on, come on!
It'd be fun.

71
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,633
I can hear it in your voice.

72
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:55,767
You need a break.

73
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,537
Goodbye, Michael.

74
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,873
Jan and I understand each other.

75
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,009
The romance thing is sort of
on hold for the time being.

76
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,044
But we've remained good friends.

77
00:04:06,046 --> 00:04:08,080
Good friends with privileges.

78
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,049
Not now.
Someday.

79
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,285
Okay, everybody.
Tonight's event

80
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,420
is to benefit
the Boy Scouts of America.

81
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,756
Again.
We do that every year.

82
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,024
Well, they need our money.

83
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,559
They don't have cookies
like the Girl Scouts.

84
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:22,527
It'd be nice to do
something for people

85
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,862
who are actually suffering.

86
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,831
Well, Oscar,
if you don't like it,

87
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,166
then you should
concentrate on winning.

88
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,103
Because the person
at the end of the evening

89
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:34,806
with the highest chip count
will receive $500

90
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:37,075
to donate to the charity
of their choice.

91
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,211
And they will get a mini fridge

92
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,812
compliments of
Vance Refrigeration.

93
00:04:40,814 --> 00:04:43,515
So, get your charities into Pam.

94
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:46,285
I, for example, am playing
for Comic Relief.

95
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:47,719
That doesn't exist anymore.

96
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:51,823
Comedy's very much alive,
as are homeless people.

97
00:04:51,825 --> 00:04:54,092
No, they stopped
making that show.

98
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:57,429
Well, then they need
our money more than ever.

99
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,598
You have to pick an approved
nonprofit organization.

100
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,933
There's a great soup kitchen
in downtown Scranton.

101
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:04,236
Delicious pea soup on Thursdays.

102
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:06,104
I'll probably give
the money to them.

103
00:05:06,106 --> 00:05:09,141
Something with animals.

104
00:05:09,143 --> 00:05:10,909
Or people.

105
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,379
Kobe Bryant has a foundation,
and he is so hot.

106
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,649
And he gave his wife
the biggest diamond ring.

107
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,384
I know he didn't do it.

108
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,055
Maybe he did it.

109
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:26,391
We are giving money
that has been gambled.

110
00:05:26,393 --> 00:05:28,894
Why don't we just deal drugs
or prostitute ourselves

111
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,829
and donate that money
to charity?

112
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:33,799
Oh, and another fun thing.

113
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,100
We, at the end of the night,

114
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,768
are going to give the check

115
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,037
to an actual group
of Boy Scouts.

116
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,772
Right, Toby?
We're gonna...

117
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,973
Actually, I didn't think
it was appropriate

118
00:05:41,975 --> 00:05:44,643
to invite children since it's...

119
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:47,279
You know, there's gambling
and alcohol.

120
00:05:47,281 --> 00:05:48,780
And it's
in our dangerous warehouse.

121
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:51,550
And it's a school night.

122
00:05:51,552 --> 00:05:54,052
And, you know,
Hooters is catering.

123
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:57,522
Is that enough?
Should I keep going?

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,694
Why are you the way
that you are?

125
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,564
Honestly, every time I try
to do something fun

126
00:06:05,566 --> 00:06:06,932
or exciting,

127
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:10,502
you make it not that way.

128
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:14,039
I hate so much

129
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,942
about the things
that you choose to be.

130
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:19,878
Okay, you know what?

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,881
I will not donate my winnings

132
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,751
to Comic Relief since
apparently it doesn't exist.

133
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:30,255
I am going to donate to
Afghanistanis with AIDS.

134
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,023
I think you mean
the Aid to Afghanistan.

135
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:35,026
No, I mean Afghanistanis
with AIDS.

136
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,995
Afghani.
What?

137
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:39,164
Afghani.
That's a dog.

138
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,298
No, that's Afghan.

139
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,800
That's a shawl.

140
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:42,934
Wait. Canine AIDS?

141
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:44,636
No, humans with AIDS.
Who has AIDS?

142
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:47,572
Guys, the Afghanistananis.

143
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,674
You know what?
No. No.

144
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:52,043
AIDS is not funny.

145
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,945
Believe me.
I have tried.

146
00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:57,082
There are certain topics that
are off-limits to comedians.

147
00:06:57,084 --> 00:07:00,852
JFK. AIDS.
The Holocaust.

148
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,655
The Lincoln assassination
just recently became funny.

149
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:06,892
"I need to see this play like
I need a hole in the head."

150
00:07:08,429 --> 00:07:10,796
And I hope to someday
live in a world

151
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:14,132
where a person could tell
a hilarious AIDS joke.

152
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,967
It's one of my dreams.

153
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,602
What are you doing?

154
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,504
Oh, nothing.

155
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:23,308
"Till Death Do Us Rock."

156
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,876
They're wedding bands.
Oh.

157
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,178
Roy was supposed to
pick the band,

158
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,414
but he's concentrating more
on the bachelor party now.

159
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:30,749
Wait, wait, where are you going?

160
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,184
I mean, even if you don't
hire a band,

161
00:07:32,186 --> 00:07:34,686
you still have to
watch the bands.

162
00:07:34,688 --> 00:07:38,323
Pam, these are people who have
never given up on their dreams.

163
00:07:38,325 --> 00:07:40,192
I have great respect for that.

164
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,161
And yes, they're all
probably very bad.

165
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:44,362
And that'll make me feel better

166
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:46,631
about not having dreams.

167
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,433
There's a KISS
cover band in here.

168
00:07:48,435 --> 00:07:50,001
Let's do it.

169
00:07:51,338 --> 00:07:52,671
I'm pretty happy these days.

170
00:07:52,673 --> 00:07:54,506
I'm getting married soon,

171
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:57,309
and I'm getting along
with everybody at work.

172
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,847
Why did I talk to Jan
about transferring?

173
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:03,915
Well, you know...

174
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,352
I have no future here.

175
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,823
I have already put down
the deposit.

176
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,226
Do you understand
how a deposit works?

177
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:17,429
Mike, I am not having fire
eaters in a paper warehouse.

178
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,964
It's Casino Night.

179
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:21,099
Like Las Vegas. There are
fire eaters all over the place.

180
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,501
Except my warehouse.

181
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,768
Actually, it's my warehouse.

182
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,137
Actually, it's owned
by Beekman Properties,

183
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:29,040
and Dunder Mifflin is four
years into a seven-year lease.

184
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:31,243
Why are you here?

185
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:32,244
When Darryl was coming,

186
00:08:32,246 --> 00:08:33,945
you said you wanted me
here for protection.

187
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:38,717
N-N... I said not that.

188
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,819
We just have a lot
of stuff down there

189
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:42,087
that could be stolen.

190
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:44,089
That's ironic.

191
00:08:44,091 --> 00:08:45,323
What?

192
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,392
That you are afraid.

193
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,227
Why? 'Cause
I'm from the hood?

194
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,496
Dinkin flicka.

195
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:54,866
Dinkin flicka.

196
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:58,136
I taught Mike some phrases

197
00:08:58,138 --> 00:09:00,972
to help with his
interracial conversations.

198
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,275
You know, stuff like
"fleece it out,"

199
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:06,111
"gormac five,
"dinkin flicka."

200
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:09,548
You know, things us Negroes say.

201
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,283
Give me some.

202
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:15,387
Oot!
Oot!

203
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,256
Oh, yeah. I taught him
a handshake, too.

204
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,781
Wow. I don't know
how you're gonna decide.

205
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,749
They are all extremely good.

206
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,951
I think I should hire them all.

207
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,520
Do like Lollapalooza.
Have three stages, yeah.

208
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:50,522
Your mom would love that.

209
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:52,257
She would.

210
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,926
Now this band is
called Scrantonicity.

211
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,363
Let's take a look.
Nice.

212
00:09:58,365 --> 00:10:00,765
Oh, wait.
That's Kevin.

213
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,634
On the drums.
What?

214
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,903
On the drums! Oh, my God!
That's Kevin.

215
00:10:04,905 --> 00:10:08,340
Great song, Kev.

216
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:12,377
Oh, my God. He's the drummer
and the singer.

217
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,113
We really don't do
a lot of weddings.

218
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:19,050
We actually don't play
in public very often.

219
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,488
We're all really hoping
that Pam's wedding works out.

220
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:26,791
This could be a turning point
for the band.

221
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,226
Wow. Oh!

222
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:32,063
Yeah, you haven't seen
that since 1983.

223
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,832
That is amazing.

224
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:36,601
Okay, we have to sign him.
I'm gonna call the label...

225
00:10:36,603 --> 00:10:38,770
No, no, no!
Come back!

226
00:10:38,772 --> 00:10:40,372
Hey, you're gonna lose him
to another wedding. Kev!

227
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:42,307
Jim is great.

228
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,042
Being with him just takes away

229
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:46,277
all the stress
of planning my wedding.

230
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:49,047
Yes?

231
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,682
Michael, Carol Stills for you.

232
00:10:50,684 --> 00:10:53,652
Who?
Carol Stills.

233
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:55,020
Do I know a Carol Stills?

234
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:56,154
Your realtor.

235
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,856
Oh, yeah, put her through.

236
00:10:57,858 --> 00:11:00,759
Hey, Carol, how goes
the real estate biz?

237
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,694
Is it real good?

238
00:11:02,696 --> 00:11:03,795
Still me.

239
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:05,397
Sometimes I don't put
Michael through

240
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,298
until he's already
said something.

241
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,168
I look at it as
a practice run for him.

242
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,671
He usually does better
on the second attempt.

243
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,606
Carol, you're on with Michael.

244
00:11:14,608 --> 00:11:15,740
Hello, Michael.

245
00:11:15,742 --> 00:11:17,642
Hi, Carol.
how you doing?

246
00:11:17,644 --> 00:11:19,911
I'm great. I just needed
one last signature

247
00:11:19,913 --> 00:11:21,146
for your mortgage insurance.

248
00:11:21,148 --> 00:11:23,181
Oh, hey, no problemo.

249
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:24,616
Incidentally, I love the place.

250
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:25,984
Oh, great.

251
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,252
Has a little bit
of a weird smell.

252
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:29,454
It's okay. At Christmas,
the tree helped.

253
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:31,256
Oh, good.
I'm glad.

254
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,525
Um, can I drop it over later?

255
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,262
Actually, I'm sort of
hosting this charity thing

256
00:11:37,264 --> 00:11:39,030
in our warehouse.
Casino Night.

257
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,532
Oh, great.

258
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,933
Yeah, it'll be good.

259
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,302
You know what?
Why don't you come by?

260
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,937
Bring the papers.
I'll sign 'em.

261
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,106
And then you can stay
and have a drink.

262
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,441
To the casino thing?

263
00:11:49,443 --> 00:11:51,476
Yeah, it'll be fun.
What do you...

264
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,879
Oh, I'm sorry.
Can you hold on?

265
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,382
Michael, Jan's on line two.

266
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,850
Okay.
Put her through.

267
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:03,288
Jan Levinson, I presume?

268
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:07,692
It's still me.
Jan, here's Michael.

269
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:08,793
Michael?

270
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:10,095
Hey, Jan.
How you doing?

271
00:12:10,097 --> 00:12:12,831
You know, I... I thought
about it,

272
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,799
and you are right.

273
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,034
I am?

274
00:12:16,036 --> 00:12:17,402
I could use a little fun.

275
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:20,438
So I am going to drive up
for your Casino Night.

276
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,273
Uh... okay.

277
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:24,909
Incidentally,
what is the charity?

278
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,977
AIDS.

279
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,081
Okay then. I will...
I'll see you tonight.

280
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,117
Okay.
Sounds great.

281
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:33,585
Bye-bye.
Bye.

282
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,755
Uh, hello, Carol?

283
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,757
Sorry about that.

284
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,325
No problemo.

285
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:43,061
Right. Um...

286
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:45,563
To answer your question, yes.

287
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:48,133
What?
I'd love to go.

288
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,768
Okay.
I have to get a sitter,

289
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,102
but that shouldn't be a problem.

290
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:52,303
Problem. Good.

291
00:12:52,305 --> 00:12:53,905
And I'll bring the papers too.

292
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,308
Good. All right.
Sounds great.

293
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,010
Well, I'll see you tonight.
Bye.

294
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,411
Bye.

295
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,751
Two queens on Casino Night.

296
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,356
I am going to drop a deuce
on everybody.

297
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:20,598
Oh, my God!

298
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:25,670
Mwah!
That's great!

299
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:28,540
Hey, Carol.
You look great.

300
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:30,475
Thanks.
Thank you for inviting me.

301
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:31,743
It looks so great in here.

302
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:33,378
Well.

303
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:38,750
That's how we do it
in the paper biz.

304
00:13:38,752 --> 00:13:41,085
It's European.

305
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,822
Michael.
Yes? Ah, Dwight!

306
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,793
Codename Re/Max is here.

307
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:51,229
No sign of Ian Jevinson.

308
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,798
I'm Michael's wingman.
I've got his back.

309
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,066
Two dates.

310
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:58,069
He's got two dates tonight.

311
00:13:58,071 --> 00:14:00,305
My job is keep Jan
away from Carol.

312
00:14:00,307 --> 00:14:01,940
And vice versa.

313
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:06,377
Michael said, "We must deceive
them so as not to hurt them,

314
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,714
and in that way,
we honor them."

315
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,750
Can I get you a drink?

316
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:15,220
The food is from Hooters.

317
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:17,388
A drink would be good.
Okay.

318
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,527
Oh, I steal things all the time.

319
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,495
It's just something I do.

320
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,598
I stopped caring
a long time ago.

321
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,268
You should see how many supplies
I've taken from this place.

322
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,338
Honestly, I love
stealing things.

323
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,306
I'm gonna get a drink.
Do you need anything?

324
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,008
No, I'm fine.
Thanks, sweetheart.

325
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,815
Billy, your nurse is hot.

326
00:14:43,817 --> 00:14:45,717
That's my girlfriend.

327
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,786
Your nurse became
your girlfriend. Sweet.

328
00:14:48,788 --> 00:14:50,355
She was never my nurse.
I met her at Chili's.

329
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:51,589
She was my waitress.

330
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:55,727
Chili's is great.

331
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,669
Willkommen. Bienvenue.

332
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:08,039
And welcome to Monte Carlo.

333
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:11,242
Dwight.

334
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,078
I am no longer your boss.

335
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,314
Lady Fortune is your boss.

336
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,516
Will Lady Fortune
give me a raise?

337
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,351
Shut it, shut it.

338
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:21,452
Will Lady Fortune
be your mistress?

339
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:26,257
Only time will tell, my friends.

340
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:29,794
Leave all your preconceived
notions about casinos

341
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:31,362
at the door.

342
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,767
Old friends.
New lovers.

343
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:40,171
And the disabled.
Welcome all!

344
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,472
Great. Okay.

345
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:43,007
Shuffle up and deal.

346
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,909
Let's get it started.

347
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,178
Black-eyed crows.

348
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:49,414
Okay, the game is no-limit
Texas Hold 'Em.

349
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:51,382
Good luck, everybody.

350
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,755
That's at least
four red chips to you, sir.

351
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,761
All in.

352
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,196
Oh!

353
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:06,464
Bluffing is a key part of poker,

354
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:08,032
which is too bad,

355
00:16:08,034 --> 00:16:11,903
because I am not
very good at bluffing.

356
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,838
Did you believe me?

357
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,607
I'll call.

358
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:20,311
What are...
That's insane.

359
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,447
I have good cards.

360
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,816
Well, Toby, I went
all in on the first hand,

361
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:27,585
so doesn't that tell you that
I might have good cards too?

362
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:29,687
So don't be stupid.
Just take it back.

363
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,022
I'm sorry. He can't, sir.
He's gone all in.

364
00:16:31,024 --> 00:16:32,023
Okay, all right, whatever.

365
00:16:32,025 --> 00:16:34,125
Flip 'em.

366
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,932
You really screwed that up.

367
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:43,101
Way to go, Toby.

368
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:46,371
I don't really play cards,
but I'm not gonna lie to you.

369
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,873
It felt really good to take
money from Michael.

370
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,311
Gonna chase that feeling.

371
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,812
That's the normal question.

372
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,949
I expect to do
very well tonight.

373
00:16:57,951 --> 00:17:00,718
I have an acute ability
to read people.

374
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,554
Jim for instance
has a huge tell.

375
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:06,924
When he gets a good hand,
he coughs.

376
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,728
Uh, I will raise.

377
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,871
Thanks.

378
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:24,275
It's the weirdest thing.
Every time I cough, he folds.

379
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,309
Wow. Bad luck.

380
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:26,978
Ah, yeah, whatever.

381
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,580
Hey, you know what?
If luck weren't involved,

382
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,650
I would always be winning.

383
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:35,386
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

384
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,788
Michael.

385
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,790
Jan.
Hi.

386
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,592
Look, okay.
I think we're all adults here.

387
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,661
And it has always been
my understanding

388
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:45,897
that we have
an open relationship.

389
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,932
What are... Wait.
What are you talking about?

390
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,834
What does that mean?

391
00:17:49,836 --> 00:17:52,470
After you said
you weren't coming,

392
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,138
I invited Carol to come.

393
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,541
And I don't think that
I did anything wrong.

394
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,545
No.
No, you didn't.

395
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,612
Hi, I'm Jan.
I'm Michael's boss.

396
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:02,747
Hi.

397
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,849
Does anyone want a drink?

398
00:18:04,851 --> 00:18:06,150
No, I'm good.

399
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:07,718
Okay.

400
00:18:09,888 --> 00:18:14,225
Heh. Um...

401
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,494
Hey, hey.
Hey... what?

402
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,796
Jan's here.

403
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,201
Give me the dice.

404
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:26,237
Come on, Dwight.
It's on you, baby.

405
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,439
Good evening, Dwight.
What is this?

406
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,842
Evening, Angela.
This is craps.

407
00:18:30,844 --> 00:18:33,678
I need to roll an eight.
If I do, everyone wins.

408
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,546
Then roll an eight.

409
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,914
Thank you, Angela.

410
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,884
Good luck, Dwight.

411
00:18:39,886 --> 00:18:44,355
Yeah! Yeah! Mwah!

412
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,157
That's good stuff.

413
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:49,160
Dwight, let's keep it going.
Let's keep it going.

414
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,361
Let it ride.
Let it all ride.

415
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:52,063
Give me the dice!

416
00:19:00,372 --> 00:19:01,405
Yeah, right.

417
00:19:01,407 --> 00:19:02,440
"Yeah, right," what?

418
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:03,908
What was this?

419
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,544
I have good cards.

420
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:08,246
Really?
Mm-hmm.

421
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:11,415
And I'm gonna take you all in.
Wow.

422
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,552
I think you're bluffing.

423
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,265
Yeah, I think she's full of it.

424
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,504
Straight.
Oh.

425
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:35,306
Three nines.

426
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:37,875
Jim Halpert,
ladies and gentlemen.

427
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,244
Thank you very much.
It was fun.

428
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,714
Cosmopolitan, please.

429
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,184
Can I get a red wine?

430
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,821
So, uh, so two hours.
That's a long drive.

431
00:19:50,823 --> 00:19:52,356
Well, it's part of the job.

432
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,325
You know, keep an eye on things.

433
00:19:54,327 --> 00:19:57,828
So... why not?

434
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:06,204
So how long have
you and Michael been, um...

435
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,340
Oh, uh, well, actually,

436
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:13,344
I guess this would be
our first date, I guess.

437
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:15,213
Casino Night in the warehouse.

438
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,614
Good sport.

439
00:20:16,616 --> 00:20:18,182
Well, I'm having a nice time.

440
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,285
Oh, me too.
Me too.

441
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,262
One beer, and one 7 and 7

442
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:32,830
with eight Maraschino cherries,

443
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,899
sugar on the rim,
blended if you can.

444
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,568
So that's still going on, huh?

445
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,003
You and Kelly?

446
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,506
All right!

447
00:20:42,508 --> 00:20:44,275
Point is four.
Shooter roll a four.

448
00:20:44,277 --> 00:20:47,378
Come on, shooter!

449
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,913
Blow!
Blow for luck.

450
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,815
Yeah!

451
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:53,818
Also you.
Not playing favorites.

452
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,255
All right, here we go.
Yeah!

453
00:20:57,257 --> 00:20:59,757
Five.
Aw, so close, so close.

454
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,425
Come on.

455
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,261
So, where are you
staying, Radisson?

456
00:21:03,263 --> 00:21:06,364
What? Super 8? Motel 6?
Best Western.

457
00:21:06,366 --> 00:21:09,066
I didn't...
Holiday Inn?

458
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:10,301
The Hyatt
in Wilkes-Barre?

459
00:21:10,303 --> 00:21:11,702
Are you staying with Michael?

460
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:13,704
All right!

461
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,112
I won the 2002 $2,500

462
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,381
No-Limit Deuce to Seven
Draw Tournament

463
00:21:23,383 --> 00:21:26,083
at the World Series
of Poker in Vegas.

464
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:29,754
So, yeah, I'm pretty good
at poker.

465
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:33,991
All in.

466
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:35,693
Okay, let's do it.

467
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:37,028
Good luck, honey.

468
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,562
Oh, thank you, Bobby,
but it doesn't matter.

469
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:39,797
It's just fun to play.

470
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,599
Three queens.

471
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:42,867
Nice, very nice.

472
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:43,868
I have an Ace.

473
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,871
No, that's a flush.
Oh, man!

474
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,239
I have a flush!
Yes!

475
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:50,941
Look, I won. Look,
I have all the clovers.

476
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:52,410
You want to play again?

477
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:54,011
I suck.

478
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,349
She took you down, huh?

479
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,419
I do not want to talk about it.

480
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:03,854
Hey, I saw your tape.

481
00:22:03,856 --> 00:22:07,024
Your band, Scrantonicity.
You guys rock.

482
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,259
Yeah?

483
00:22:08,261 --> 00:22:11,095
Yeah, you guys want
to play our wedding?

484
00:22:11,097 --> 00:22:12,730
Awesome.

485
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,165
Did Pam say it was okay?

486
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,168
Whatever.
I'm in charge of the music.

487
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,137
Dude, you will not be sorry.

488
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:21,572
Sweet.

489
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:23,474
All right.
All right.

490
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,151
Smoke?

491
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:35,419
No, thanks.

492
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,090
You having fun?

493
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,992
Fabulous time.

494
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,298
I drove two and a half hours
to get here.

495
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,169
Yeah, we all really... Left
work early, drove down here.

496
00:22:52,171 --> 00:22:55,606
And I am completely
underdressed.

497
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:57,808
I think you look great.

498
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:02,513
Why did I hook up with Michael?

499
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,217
Yeah, why did you?

500
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:12,123
It was very late, Jim.
Very late and, uh...

501
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,626
Have you given any more thought
to the transfer?

502
00:23:15,628 --> 00:23:17,895
Oh, yeah.

503
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:19,764
Good.
Mm-hmm.

504
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,267
Have you told anyone?

505
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:26,670
No.
Well, you should.

506
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:36,213
Uh, excuse me.

507
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,415
Uh, big moment.

508
00:23:37,417 --> 00:23:40,418
The evening's chip leader

509
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,988
and winner of this beautiful
mini refrigerator

510
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:48,058
courtesy of Vance Refrigeration,

511
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,561
Creed Bradden,
Dunder-Mifflin.

512
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,368
Thanks. I never owned
a refrigerator.

513
00:24:02,307 --> 00:24:04,508
Sorry, babe.
I'm just beat.

514
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,178
It's okay. I'll see you at home.
Okay.

515
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,146
Hey, don't try to lose
too much money, all right?

516
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,681
Okay. In case you still
want a honeymoon.

517
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:15,886
Hey, Halpert.
Keep an eye on her, all right?

518
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,088
Okay.
Will do.

519
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:20,224
Bye.

520
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,827
Hey.

521
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:24,295
Hey, how's it going?
Good.

522
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:28,799
Especially after I took all your
money in poker. Ha-ha, yeah.

523
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:33,671
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

524
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:35,272
About when you wanna give me
more of your money?

525
00:24:35,274 --> 00:24:36,674
No. Did you wanna do that now?

526
00:24:36,676 --> 00:24:39,143
We can go inside.
I'm feeling kinda good tonight.

527
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,745
I was just, um...

528
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:47,551
I'm in love with you.

529
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,786
What?

530
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,190
I'm really sorry if that's
weird for you to hear,

531
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:56,026
but I needed you
to... hear it.

532
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,898
Probably not good timing.
I know that, I just...

533
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,566
What are you doing?

534
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,272
What do you expect me
to say to that?

535
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:13,344
I just needed you to know.

536
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:14,845
Once.

537
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,250
Well, I, um...

538
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,052
I...

539
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,990
I can't.

540
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:27,391
Yeah.

541
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:31,495
You have no idea...
Don't do that.

542
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:34,231
...what your friendship
means to me.

543
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:37,368
Come on.
I don't wanna do that.

544
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,303
I wanna be more than that.

545
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,139
I can't.

546
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:50,214
I'm really sorry
if you misinterpreted things.

547
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,685
It's probably my fault.

548
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,788
Not your fault.

549
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,426
I'm sorry I misinterpreted
our friendship.

550
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,403
Hey!

551
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,538
I'm leaving. Hey! Okay.

552
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,539
So I just wanted
to congratulate you

553
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,574
on a fantastic evening.

554
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:17,775
Did the company proud.
Thank you.

555
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,343
And, uh, thanks for inviting me.

556
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,078
You were right.
I needed it, so thanks.

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,646
Okay. Thanks for coming.
Nice to meet you.

558
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,449
And you guys have a good
time together. Okay.

559
00:26:25,451 --> 00:26:26,617
Talk to you Monday.
Yep.

560
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,719
Bye-bye.
Good night.

561
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,689
She's a good boss.

562
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:32,923
She seems really nice.

563
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,525
Oh, she's great.

564
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:36,594
Love triangle drama.

565
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,929
All worked out
in the end though.

566
00:26:38,931 --> 00:26:42,032
The hero got the girl.
Who saw that coming?

567
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,300
I did.

568
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:44,935
And Jan is really happy for me.

569
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,937
So actually,
the hero got two girls.

570
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,772
He got the girl
that he works with,

571
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,942
and he got the girl
that he buys real estate from.

572
00:26:53,178 --> 00:26:57,948
So I've got my New York girl
and my local flavor.

573
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,351
Life is good.

574
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,021
About ten minutes ago.

575
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:08,025
No, I didn't know what to say.

576
00:27:08,827 --> 00:27:10,427
Yes, I know.

577
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:13,597
Um, I don't know, Mom.

578
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,466
He's my best friend.

579
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:19,903
Yeah, he's great.

580
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:24,208
Yeah, I think I am.

581
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,078
Um, I have to go.
I will.

582
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:32,349
Listen, Jim.
