1
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:33,667
Tonight is the Dundies,

2
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,753
the annual employee awards night
here at Dunder Mifflin.

3
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:40,923
And this is everybody's
favorite day.

4
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:42,258
Everybody looks forward to it.

5
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:44,360
Because, you know,
a lot of the people here

6
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:47,463
don't get trophies very often.

7
00:00:47,465 --> 00:00:48,731
Like, Meredith or Kevin.

8
00:00:48,733 --> 00:00:50,233
I mean, who's gonna give
Kevin an award,

9
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:51,267
Dunkin' Donuts?

10
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:52,368
Plus, bonus,

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,569
it's really, really funny.

12
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:56,372
So I... You know, an employee
will go home,

13
00:00:56,374 --> 00:00:58,975
and he'll tell his neighbor,
"Hey, did you get an award?"

14
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,110
And the neighbor'll say,
"No, man."

15
00:01:01,112 --> 00:01:03,613
I mean, I slave all day.
Nobody notices me.

16
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:05,014
Next thing you know,

17
00:01:05,016 --> 00:01:06,849
employee smells
something terrible

18
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:08,751
coming from
the neighbor's house.

19
00:01:08,753 --> 00:01:10,887
Neighbor's hanged himself.

20
00:01:10,889 --> 00:01:13,122
Due to lack of recognition.

21
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:14,791
So...

22
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:17,593
So you ready for the Dundies?

23
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:18,761
Ugh.

24
00:01:18,763 --> 00:01:20,396
You know what they say
about a car wreck,

25
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:23,232
where it's so awful,
you can't look away?

26
00:01:23,234 --> 00:01:25,835
The Dundies are like
a car wreck that,

27
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,003
you wanna look away,

28
00:01:27,005 --> 00:01:28,638
but you have to stare at it

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,841
because your boss is making you.

30
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:33,209
Hey-hey-hey!

31
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,944
It's Fat Halpert!

32
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,314
What?

33
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:39,515
Fat Halpert!

34
00:01:39,517 --> 00:01:41,484
Jim Halpert.

35
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,621
So why don't I take
you on a tour

36
00:01:45,623 --> 00:01:47,523
of past Dundie winners?

37
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,493
We got Fat Jim Halpert here.

38
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:52,795
Jim, why don't you show off
your Dundies to the camera?

39
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:54,664
Oh, I can't
because I keep them hidden.

40
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:57,066
I don't wanna look at them
and get cocky.

41
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:58,367
Oh!
That's a good idea.

42
00:01:58,369 --> 00:01:59,435
Mine are at home,

43
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,504
in a display case above my bed.

44
00:02:01,506 --> 00:02:04,207
Yeeaacck! TMI.
TMI, my friends.

45
00:02:04,209 --> 00:02:05,274
TMI?

46
00:02:05,276 --> 00:02:06,576
Too Much Information.

47
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:09,479
Uh, it's just easier to say TMI.

48
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,781
I used to say "Don't go there,"
but that's lame.

49
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:14,150
And here we have
Stanley the Manley.

50
00:02:14,152 --> 00:02:15,952
Now, Stanley is
a Dundie all-star.

51
00:02:15,954 --> 00:02:17,320
Aren't you, Stanley?

52
00:02:17,322 --> 00:02:19,388
Why don't you, uh,
show them some of your bling.

53
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,556
I don't know where they are.

54
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,724
I think I threw them out.

55
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,359
Oh, no, you di-in't.

56
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,795
Uh, think I did.

57
00:02:25,797 --> 00:02:27,363
Mm... Why did...

58
00:02:27,365 --> 00:02:30,466
Say, we gotta order some more
appe-teasers this time

59
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,968
We ran out last year, remember?

60
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,402
Yes, we should.
I... You know what?

61
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:36,005
I wanted one of those
skillets of cheese.

62
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,673
But when I got off stage,

63
00:02:37,675 --> 00:02:40,376
someone had eaten all of them.

64
00:02:42,513 --> 00:02:44,514
To Oscar Martinez,

65
00:02:44,516 --> 00:02:47,083
it's the
Show Me the Money award.

66
00:02:47,085 --> 00:02:50,653
Michael has taped
every Dundies Awards.

67
00:02:50,655 --> 00:02:53,222
And now he's making me
look through

68
00:02:53,224 --> 00:02:56,192
hours of footage
to find highlights.

69
00:02:56,194 --> 00:02:58,094
For the ladies.
Hit it, Dwight.

70
00:03:08,206 --> 00:03:09,705
Oh, yeah.

71
00:03:09,707 --> 00:03:11,307
This is the part where Kevin sat

72
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:13,075
in front of the camcorder
all night.

73
00:03:13,077 --> 00:03:14,610
It's great.

74
00:03:21,152 --> 00:03:22,585
It was you.

75
00:03:22,587 --> 00:03:23,686
It wasn't.
I swear.

76
00:03:23,688 --> 00:03:24,720
Yeah, it was.

77
00:03:24,722 --> 00:03:25,788
So what's the joke?

78
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,089
You're not perfect either.

79
00:03:27,091 --> 00:03:29,425
We're not laughing
at you, Dwight.

80
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:30,660
So who are we laughing at?

81
00:03:30,662 --> 00:03:32,795
Um, just something
somebody wrote.

82
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,530
Who? Dave Barry?

83
00:03:34,532 --> 00:03:36,232
No, no.

84
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:38,868
Just something that was written
on the ladies room wall.

85
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:40,336
What is it?
Who wrote it?

86
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:41,938
Um, it's kind of private.

87
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,639
It's about Michael.

88
00:03:44,842 --> 00:03:46,742
That is defacement
of company property.

89
00:03:46,744 --> 00:03:48,044
So you'd better tell me.

90
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:51,347
Kelly, if you tell me,
you'll be punished less.

91
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:54,083
Okay, now I'm laughing at you.

92
00:03:56,187 --> 00:03:59,221
Will her highness
Jan Levinson-Gould

93
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:02,658
be descending from her corporate
throne this evening

94
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,228
to visit us lowly serfs
here at Dunder Mifflin Scranton?

95
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,732
It's a two-and-a-half-hour
drive from New York, Michael.

96
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:11,100
Well, you could take the bus.

97
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:12,668
You could work on the way here,

98
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:13,836
sleep on the way home.

99
00:04:13,838 --> 00:04:14,870
No.

100
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,706
Come on, Jan.
This is important.

101
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:18,674
I mean, this is,
this is validation

102
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:20,042
to my employees here

103
00:04:20,044 --> 00:04:22,311
that you and corporate
approve of this.

104
00:04:22,313 --> 00:04:24,313
Well, we don't
approve of this, Michael.

105
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:26,315
W... I mean, you only
have the budget

106
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,451
for one office party
a year, so...

107
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:30,886
we're not paying for this.

108
00:04:30,888 --> 00:04:33,990
Um...

109
00:04:33,992 --> 00:04:35,291
Can you...?

110
00:04:35,293 --> 00:04:37,026
Are you there, Michael?
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

111
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:38,327
I just wanted to, uh...

112
00:04:38,329 --> 00:04:40,129
talk to you for
a second about that.

113
00:04:40,131 --> 00:04:42,765
Um, what, uh, what is...

114
00:04:42,767 --> 00:04:45,301
I mean, come on!
Jan.

115
00:04:45,303 --> 00:04:47,403
What's... You're droppin'
an A-bomb on me here.

116
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,672
Really? I'm dropping
an atomic bomb on you?

117
00:04:49,674 --> 00:04:51,007
Well, yeah.
I mean, what is...

118
00:04:51,009 --> 00:04:52,375
Right.

119
00:04:52,377 --> 00:04:54,710
You already had a party
on May 5th for no reason.

120
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:57,980
No reason!
It was the 05-05-05 party.

121
00:04:57,982 --> 00:04:59,415
It happens once
every billion years.

122
00:04:59,417 --> 00:05:00,816
And you had a luau.

123
00:05:00,818 --> 00:05:02,585
And the tsunami relief
fundraiser,

124
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:04,487
which somehow
lost a lot of money.

125
00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,722
Okay, no, that was a fun raiser.

126
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:08,991
I think I made that
very clear in the flyers.

127
00:05:08,993 --> 00:05:10,326
Fun, F-U-N.

128
00:05:10,328 --> 00:05:11,694
Okay, well, I don't
understand why anyone

129
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:12,862
would have a tsunami
fun raiser, Michael.

130
00:05:12,864 --> 00:05:14,030
Well, I think a lot of people

131
00:05:14,032 --> 00:05:16,332
were very affected
by the footage.

132
00:05:16,334 --> 00:05:19,735
It's a little character
I like to do.

133
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:23,072
It is, uh,
loosely based on Carnac,

134
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:25,775
one of Carson's
classic characters.

135
00:05:25,777 --> 00:05:28,644
Here we go.

136
00:05:28,646 --> 00:05:30,379
The PLO, the IRA,

137
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:34,283
and the hot dog stand
behind the warehouse.

138
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:41,857
Name three businesses that have
better heath-care plans

139
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:45,561
than Dunder Mifflin.

140
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:48,264
Here's the problem.

141
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:50,733
There's no open bar
because of Jan.

142
00:05:50,735 --> 00:05:53,335
And it's the reason why

143
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:57,306
comedy clubs have
a two-drink minimum.

144
00:05:57,308 --> 00:06:00,509
I mean, it'll be fine, I just...

145
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:03,913
wish people were gonna be drunk.

146
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:15,758
Dwight, get out of here.

147
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,927
What are you doing in the ladies room?
It's not what you...

148
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:19,361
No! Why were you in there?

149
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:21,831
What were you doing in there? I am not.
You are in there...

150
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:26,135
The Dundie award
for longest engagement

151
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,938
goes to Pam Beesley.

152
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,774
Pam, everybody!
Yoo!

153
00:06:31,776 --> 00:06:33,809
When is that girl
gonna get married?

154
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,878
That's what I have to say.
Aha, Roy's accepting.

155
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,646
Thank you, Roy, are there
any words you'd like to say

156
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:39,682
on Pam's behalf?

157
00:06:39,684 --> 00:06:41,083
Uh, we'll see you next year.

158
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:45,221
Yeah! Oh, hope not!
Hope not.

159
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:46,756
I'm not changing that.
That's the best one.

160
00:06:46,758 --> 00:06:48,524
No, it's hilarious.
You're right.

161
00:06:48,526 --> 00:06:52,428
I just think, um,
World's Longest Engagement,

162
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,196
um, we're all expecting it,
you know?

163
00:06:54,198 --> 00:06:55,664
That's why it's funny.

164
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,167
Every year that Roy and Pam
don't get married

165
00:06:58,169 --> 00:06:59,568
it gets funnier.

166
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,504
Well, I think if you use
the same jokes,

167
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:03,172
it just comes across as lazy.

168
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:08,177
Oh. Lazy.
Uh-huh.

169
00:07:08,179 --> 00:07:09,445
Excuse me, everyone.

170
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:12,014
Can I have your attention,
please?

171
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,783
I just wanted to say

172
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,051
that the women in this office
are terrible.

173
00:07:16,053 --> 00:07:17,553
Especially the ones

174
00:07:17,555 --> 00:07:19,021
who wrote that stuff
about Michael

175
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,689
on the bathroom wall.

176
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:22,558
Having a bathroom
is a privilege.

177
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,161
It is called a ladies' room
for a reason.

178
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:27,763
And if you cannot behave
like ladies,

179
00:07:27,765 --> 00:07:30,933
well then, you are not
going to have a bathroom.

180
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,835
You're taking away our bathroom?

181
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:35,738
We are going to have
two men's rooms.

182
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,339
But where would we... go?

183
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:39,608
Be prepared to hold it, folks.
Okay, okay.

184
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:40,910
From 9:00 a.m...
Look.

185
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:42,444
Michael...
Yes?

186
00:07:42,446 --> 00:07:43,879
Dwight's banning us
from our bathroom.

187
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,848
Okay, well, that's ridiculous.
So just don't...

188
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,316
I don't have time
for this right now.

189
00:07:47,318 --> 00:07:50,386
There needs to be repercussions
for people's behavior.

190
00:07:50,388 --> 00:07:53,489
Stop it! Stop it!
Okay.

191
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:55,791
Look, I know there have been
a lot of rumors flying around

192
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,560
about the Dundies this year.

193
00:07:57,562 --> 00:08:00,596
How there is no money,
and how there is no food,

194
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,233
and how the jokes
are really bad.

195
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:07,469
But, what the hell, everybody?
I mean...

196
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:13,309
God, the Dundies are about
the best in every one of us.

197
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,946
Can't you see that?
I mean...

198
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,915
Okay, we can do better.

199
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,918
So tonight, for the first time,

200
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,921
we are inviting all of your
friends and family

201
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:28,424
to attend the awards with us.

202
00:08:28,426 --> 00:08:29,625
Yes.

203
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:31,961
Yeah, not bad, right?

204
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:34,330
So let's make this
the best Dundies ever.

205
00:08:34,332 --> 00:08:36,398
Best Dundies ever.

206
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:46,109
Welcome to the eighth annual
Dundies awards.

207
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:48,712
Before we get started,
a few announcements.

208
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,714
Keep your acceptance
speeches short.

209
00:08:50,716 --> 00:08:52,649
I have wrap-it-up music,

210
00:08:52,651 --> 00:08:56,953
and I'm not afraid
to use it, Devon.

211
00:09:15,607 --> 00:09:18,141
Card!
Come on.

212
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,044
The Dundies are kind of like
a kid's birthday party.

213
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:25,482
And you go, and there's really
nothing for you to do there.

214
00:09:25,484 --> 00:09:27,917
But the kid's having
a really good time.

215
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,053
So you're kind of there.

216
00:09:30,055 --> 00:09:31,988
That's... that's kind
of what it's like.

217
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,561
The waitress tripped
on the cord.

218
00:09:38,563 --> 00:09:39,829
All right.
All right.

219
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,531
Joke landed.
So we are here.

220
00:09:41,533 --> 00:09:46,069
Thank you all for coming
to the 2005 Dundie awards.

221
00:09:46,071 --> 00:09:49,439
I am your host, Michael Scott.

222
00:09:49,441 --> 00:09:52,742
And I just wanna tell you,
please, please,

223
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,644
do not drink and drive.

224
00:09:54,646 --> 00:09:57,213
Because you may hit a bump
and spill the drink.

225
00:09:58,616 --> 00:10:00,817
I'll just put these
on the group tab.

226
00:10:00,819 --> 00:10:03,820
Nope, actually,
this year, no group tab.

227
00:10:03,822 --> 00:10:05,588
We're gonna be doing
separate checks.

228
00:10:08,093 --> 00:10:09,793
You said we could bring
our families.

229
00:10:09,795 --> 00:10:14,164
I did, and why didn't you,
Stanley?

230
00:10:14,166 --> 00:10:16,800
I did, and my wife's
name is Teri.

231
00:10:16,802 --> 00:10:19,135
Well, I'm looking forward
to meeting Teri.

232
00:10:19,137 --> 00:10:21,337
It's this person whose hand
I'm holding, Michael.

233
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,841
Oh, yeah.

234
00:10:24,843 --> 00:10:25,909
Shut it.

235
00:10:25,911 --> 00:10:27,310
Um, good.

236
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:29,546
Speaking of relationships
of all...

237
00:10:29,548 --> 00:10:31,414
all waves, shapes, and forms,

238
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:33,983
um, I was out

239
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:35,952
on a very, very hot date
last night

240
00:10:35,954 --> 00:10:37,787
with a girl
from H.R., Dwight.

241
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:40,323
Really? We don't have any
girls from H.R.

242
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,624
No, uh...

243
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,426
F-for the sake
of the story.

244
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:45,328
And things were getting
hot and heavy.

245
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:46,563
Yeah?

246
00:10:46,565 --> 00:10:48,264
And I was about to take
her bra off,

247
00:10:48,266 --> 00:10:51,334
when she had me fill out
six hours worth of paperwork.

248
00:10:51,336 --> 00:10:52,502
Like an AIDS test?

249
00:10:52,504 --> 00:10:54,404
No.

250
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:56,106
God.

251
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:57,474
Ahem!

252
00:10:57,476 --> 00:10:59,943
All right, so let's get
this pahty stahted!

253
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,511
Hey, let's go to Poor Richard's.

254
00:11:01,513 --> 00:11:03,813
Yeah, let's get out of here.

255
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:05,081
Um...

256
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,517
Guys, where are you going?

257
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,552
Pam, show's
just getting started.

258
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:11,087
Sorry.

259
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,725
And now to celebrate...

260
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:17,961
You staying?
Yeah.

261
00:11:17,963 --> 00:11:20,530
Gotta eat somewhere.

262
00:11:20,532 --> 00:11:24,567
The Busiest Beaver Award
goes to Phyllis Lapin!

263
00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:26,369
Yeah!

264
00:11:26,371 --> 00:11:30,006
Way to go, Phyllis.
Nice work. Per usual.

265
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:33,343
This says Bushiest Beaver.
What?

266
00:11:33,345 --> 00:11:36,045
I told them busiest... Idiots.
It's fine.

267
00:11:36,047 --> 00:11:37,313
We can fix it.
We'll fix it up.

268
00:11:37,315 --> 00:11:38,915
You don't have to display that.

269
00:11:38,917 --> 00:11:40,850
Because that's what happens every time!
He's a jackass!

270
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:42,018
Every year.

271
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,219
Come on, we're going
to Poor Richard's.

272
00:11:43,221 --> 00:11:45,455
No, I don't wanna go.
I don't want to!

273
00:11:45,457 --> 00:11:48,558
Pam, no. If you would've asked
me that, then you would know.

274
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,794
Herro, everybody!

275
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:54,998
Hey... how are you?
I thought you left.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Um, no, I just...
I decided to stay.

277
00:11:57,002 --> 00:11:59,169
Oh. I'll just get a
ride home from Angela.

278
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:03,473
I going to call the next award!

279
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:05,608
Oh, good, I'm just
in time for Ping.

280
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,877
Oh, that would be where?

281
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,215
Uh, me so horny, right?
You know what I'm talking about.

282
00:12:12,217 --> 00:12:14,951
Can I get a drink?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

283
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:21,592
This next award goes to somebody
who really lights up the office.

284
00:12:21,594 --> 00:12:25,429
Somebody who, I think,
a lot of us, cannot keep

285
00:12:25,431 --> 00:12:27,365
from checkin' out.

286
00:12:27,367 --> 00:12:32,003
The Hottest in the Office Award
goes to...

287
00:12:32,005 --> 00:12:34,472
Ryan the temp!

288
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:36,507
Yeah!

289
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:42,413
Here you go.

290
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,689
There you go.
There you go, whoo!

291
00:12:51,691 --> 00:12:54,191
What am I gonna do
with the award?

292
00:12:54,193 --> 00:12:57,661
Nothing.

293
00:12:57,663 --> 00:13:00,464
I... I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

294
00:13:00,466 --> 00:13:03,634
That's the least
of my concerns right now.

295
00:13:03,636 --> 00:13:07,371
And the Tight-Ass Award

296
00:13:07,373 --> 00:13:08,873
goes to Angela.

297
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:11,876
Not only because she is
everybody's favorite stickler,

298
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:15,046
but because she has
a great caboose.

299
00:13:15,048 --> 00:13:19,750
So, come on down.
No.

300
00:13:27,693 --> 00:13:29,927
I think those might be empty.

301
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:31,362
No, no, 'cause the ice melts,

302
00:13:31,364 --> 00:13:33,297
and then it's like,
second drink.

303
00:13:34,734 --> 00:13:37,435
Second drink?

304
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:38,936
The Spicy Curry Award

305
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,605
goes to our very own,
Kelly Capour.

306
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:44,075
Get on up here.

307
00:13:44,077 --> 00:13:45,676
There you go.

308
00:13:45,678 --> 00:13:47,578
"Spicy Curry," what's that mean?

309
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,713
Um, not everything means
something, it's just a joke.

310
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,282
Yeah, but why'd you
give it to me?

311
00:13:51,284 --> 00:13:53,084
I don't know.
I just...

312
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,485
This is a bowler.
I know.

313
00:13:54,487 --> 00:13:56,287
It's... they didn't have
any more businessmen.

314
00:13:56,289 --> 00:13:59,623
Yeah, but I don't...
Just sit down, Kelly.

315
00:14:02,194 --> 00:14:04,161
It's so freaking hot in there.

316
00:14:04,163 --> 00:14:05,796
Now I know what Bob Hope
was going through

317
00:14:05,798 --> 00:14:06,864
when he performed
in Saudi Arabia.

318
00:14:06,866 --> 00:14:08,232
Man!

319
00:14:08,234 --> 00:14:10,267
I got Dwight sucking
the funny out of the room.

320
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:12,470
But, you know, you do
what you can do.

321
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:15,106
Here we go,
he's early with the cue.

322
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:16,807
Gotta go.

323
00:14:21,414 --> 00:14:23,948
Ow! Sing it, Elton!

324
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,416
Hey, thanks guys.

325
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:26,984
Hey, where're you guys from?

326
00:14:26,986 --> 00:14:28,752
We just came
from your mama's house.

327
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:29,820
Are you guys gonna finish that?

328
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:31,322
Oh, right, yeah!

329
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:33,457
Sing another song, Dude.

330
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:34,892
Uh, you know what, guys?

331
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:36,393
We're just having a little
office party.

332
00:14:36,395 --> 00:14:38,195
So if you wanna...
Hey!

333
00:14:38,197 --> 00:14:39,497
You know, cool it guys, really.

334
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:41,198
You suck, man.

335
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,667
You suck.

336
00:14:48,441 --> 00:14:51,041
Let's cut it.

337
00:14:53,745 --> 00:14:56,614
I had a few more Dundies
to give out tonight.

338
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:59,583
But I'm just gonna cut it short.

339
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,652
And wrap it up

340
00:15:01,654 --> 00:15:03,554
so everybody can
enjoy their food.

341
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:08,125
Um, thanks for listening,
those of you who listened.

342
00:15:08,127 --> 00:15:10,261
This last Dundie is for Kevin.

343
00:15:10,263 --> 00:15:12,930
This is the Don't Go In There
After Me award.

344
00:15:12,932 --> 00:15:15,566
It's for the time that I went
into the bathroom after him,

345
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,903
and it was really,
really smelly.

346
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,941
There you go.

347
00:15:29,581 --> 00:15:31,882
Yay, Kevin!

348
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:34,485
Whoo hoo!
For Kevin!

349
00:15:34,487 --> 00:15:36,687
For stinking up the bathroom!

350
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:39,757
Yeah, all right, Kev!
Whoo!

351
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,258
Hey, I haven't gotten one yet.

352
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,727
Yes, I have not
gotten one either.

353
00:15:43,729 --> 00:15:45,729
So, keep going.
More Dundies!

354
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,831
Dundie, Dundie.
Dundie, Dundie.

355
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,003
All right, all right,
all right, okay.

356
00:15:53,005 --> 00:15:54,772
All right,
we'll keep it rolling.

357
00:15:54,774 --> 00:15:56,540
Okay, this is
the Fine Work Award.

358
00:15:56,542 --> 00:15:58,275
This goes to Stanley.

359
00:15:58,277 --> 00:16:00,611
For all the fine work
he did this year.

360
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:02,746
You know you did.

361
00:16:02,748 --> 00:16:04,815
Hear, hear.

362
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:07,351
Speech, speech, speech,
speech, speech, speech...

363
00:16:07,353 --> 00:16:10,421
Well, the last year,
I got Great Work.

364
00:16:12,992 --> 00:16:15,159
So I don't know what
to think about this award.

365
00:16:15,161 --> 00:16:16,994
But, at least I didn't get

366
00:16:16,996 --> 00:16:18,929
Smelliest Bowel
Movement like Kevin.

367
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:27,571
And this next award is going out
to our own little Pam Beesley.

368
00:16:27,573 --> 00:16:29,406
I think we all know what award

369
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:30,507
Pam is gonna be
getting this year.

370
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:34,044
It is the Whitest
Sneakers Award.

371
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:38,449
Because she always has
the whitest tennis shoes on!

372
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,651
Get on down here!

373
00:16:40,653 --> 00:16:42,953
Pam Beesley,
ladies and gentlemen.

374
00:16:42,955 --> 00:16:45,756
Ooh, here we go.

375
00:16:45,758 --> 00:16:49,426
I have so many people to thank
for this award.

376
00:16:51,697 --> 00:16:53,097
Okay, first off, my Keds,

377
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,733
because I couldn't have
done it without them.

378
00:16:55,735 --> 00:16:58,202
Thank you.

379
00:16:58,204 --> 00:16:59,903
Let's give Michael
a round of applause

380
00:16:59,905 --> 00:17:01,538
for emceeing tonight,

381
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,742
because this is a lot harder
than it looks.

382
00:17:04,744 --> 00:17:07,678
And also because of Dwight too.

383
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:11,148
Um, so, finally,

384
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:16,320
I wanna thank God
because God gave me this Dundie.

385
00:17:16,322 --> 00:17:21,392
And I feel God
in this Chili's tonight.

386
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,427
Whoo!

387
00:17:23,429 --> 00:17:25,663
Pammy B.,
ladies and gentlemen.

388
00:17:25,665 --> 00:17:27,298
Oh, thank you.

389
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,933
Yeah!
Chair?

390
00:17:33,872 --> 00:17:35,439
Oh!

391
00:17:38,844 --> 00:17:42,179
What a great year
for the Dundies.

392
00:17:42,181 --> 00:17:43,547
We got to see Ping.

393
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,150
And we learned Michael's
true feelings for Ryan.

394
00:17:46,152 --> 00:17:47,685
Which was touching.

395
00:17:47,687 --> 00:17:50,120
And we heard Michael
change the lyrics

396
00:17:50,122 --> 00:17:51,789
to a number of classic songs.

397
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:54,591
Which for me,
has ruined them for life.

398
00:17:57,263 --> 00:17:58,395
What?

399
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,963
Nothing.

400
00:17:59,965 --> 00:18:01,598
Okay.

401
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,569
What?
I don't know, what?

402
00:18:05,571 --> 00:18:07,204
Oh, my God.

403
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:10,874
- You are so drunk.
- Did you get that?

404
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:11,942
Please tell me that you got...

405
00:18:11,944 --> 00:18:14,144
Vince, Vince!
Woman has had a seizure!

406
00:18:14,146 --> 00:18:15,512
Grab her tongue!
Grab her tongue!

407
00:18:15,514 --> 00:18:16,847
It's okay,
I'm a sheriff's deputy.

408
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:18,849
Well, he's a volunteer.
Don't get into that now.

409
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,451
We need something
to cushion her head.

410
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,486
A throw pillow?
A cushion?

411
00:18:22,488 --> 00:18:23,987
Okay, I'm gonna use my shirt.

412
00:18:23,989 --> 00:18:26,023
Get off of me.

413
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:27,991
I'm sorry, sir, you're gonna
have to put your clothes on.

414
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:29,159
People are trying to eat!

415
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:30,627
Was this year's
Dundies a success?

416
00:18:30,629 --> 00:18:31,995
Well, let me see.

417
00:18:31,997 --> 00:18:34,498
I made Pam laugh so hard, that
she fell out of her chair.

418
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,266
That she almost broke her neck.

419
00:18:36,268 --> 00:18:37,935
So I killed.
Almost.

420
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:40,738
Oh, my God!

421
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:41,772
I just wanna say,

422
00:18:41,774 --> 00:18:44,575
that this was the best
Dundies ever!

423
00:18:44,577 --> 00:18:46,577
Whoo!

424
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:48,679
Whoa, whoa.
Careful, careful.

425
00:18:48,681 --> 00:18:51,315
We have a strict policy here
not to over serve.

426
00:18:51,317 --> 00:18:53,817
Apparently this young woman
was sneaking drinks

427
00:18:53,819 --> 00:18:55,352
off other people's tables.

428
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:57,287
I Xeroxed her driver's license,

429
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:58,689
and she is not welcome

430
00:18:58,691 --> 00:19:00,491
at this restaurant
chain ever again.

431
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:03,293
Great work tonight.
Watch your step.

432
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,028
Excellent.
Thanks.

433
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:07,164
I had to, uh, check her pupils

434
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:09,299
to make sure
that wasn't a concussion.

435
00:19:09,301 --> 00:19:11,568
Yes, that too,
but I mean with the audio.

436
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,003
Great, great work.

437
00:19:16,608 --> 00:19:19,309
I feel bad about what I wrote
on the bathroom wall.

438
00:19:19,311 --> 00:19:21,678
No, you don't.

439
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:26,316
Oh, here she is.

440
00:19:26,318 --> 00:19:28,252
Careful, careful, whoa.

441
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:30,254
All right.
Easy.

442
00:19:30,256 --> 00:19:32,523
Almost there.

443
00:19:32,525 --> 00:19:37,194
Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?

444
00:19:37,196 --> 00:19:39,329
Shoot.

445
00:19:44,602 --> 00:19:47,638
Um... I just wanted
to say thanks.

446
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,207
That's not really a question.

447
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,910
Okay, let's get
you home, pronto.

448
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:59,483
All right. Good night. Bye.

449
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:01,952
Have a good night.
Thank you, Angela.
