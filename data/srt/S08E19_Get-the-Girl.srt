1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,380
This is Pam

2
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,136
Oh, my God, are you sure? Okay,
okay, we'll be right there

3
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:14,013
Everybody

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,723
The balloon is falling
- What?

5
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,350
There's this balloon
that has been floating

6
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,352
in the rafters of the
warehouse for, like, ever.

7
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,478
And

8
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,440
Okay, it's not it doesn't sound
cool you just have to see it

9
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,112
Well, I guess it doesn't
look that cool either

10
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,489
But it's been up there
a long time,

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,950
so it's become
a pretty big deal

12
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:38,954
Wow. It's the end
of an era.

13
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,748
You did
a good job, buddy

14
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,791
Now it's time
to come home

15
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,212
I remember when that balloon went
up there I was still with Gil

16
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:49,256
We were so happy

17
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,634
When that went up there
I had hair like Rapunzel.

18
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,597
How long do you think
it's been up there, Kevin?

19
00:00:56,765 --> 00:01:00,809
I just remember pushing aside
my silky bangs to say,

20
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,145
"Look, a balloon.'

21
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:06,065
My Warcraft clan was
still on speaking terms

22
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,233
My kid didn't
have a face tattoo

23
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,736
of going back to school

24
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,988
And I was still
just a paper salesman

25
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,409
This has been fun, Pam Thanks
for calling us all down here.

26
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,291
Kill the balloon
Kill the balloon!

27
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,753
Kill the balloon
Kill the balloon

28
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,310
Hey

29
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:45,896
So they accidentally gave us an
extra egg sandwich this morning

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,065
Who wants it?
- Ooh! Right here

31
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,274
Right here! Pick me

32
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,068
Allow me to solve
your problem then

33
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,486
Nellie

34
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,695
Mmm

35
00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,368
Ugh! That is disgusting

36
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,496
Do you call that a King
James breakfast pie?

37
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,164
What brings you to town?

38
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:09,294
Certainly not the Harry
Houdini museum What a nobody

39
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,297
"Oh, look, some Hungarian just
found their way out of a sack,

40
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,049
"let's build a shrine.'

41
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,300
No, I've come
to work here.

42
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,510
What?

43
00:02:16,594 --> 00:02:20,097
How could Robert transfer Nellie
here after the Sabre store debacle?

44
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,890
She stinks of failure

45
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,059
The fact that she could
show her face around here

46
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,686
is an embarrassment

47
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,772
an identical situation

48
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:32,067
Robert did say you'd be joining us.
Welcome, I'm Tony

49
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,027
What?

50
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:38,866
Okay, I made a mistake I
thought it might go unnoticed.

51
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,034
But, I'm Toby

52
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,245
You messed up
saying your name?

53
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,830
It happens, okay?

54
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,040
So let's just find
an empty desk for you

55
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:50,836
and I'm sure Robert will be
with you as soon as he gets in.

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
That one looks empty

57
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,547
No. It's Andy's office

58
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,757
Oh, is it?

59
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:59,428
I have one simple
philosophy in business

60
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,097
if the seat is open
the job is open.

61
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,434
It's how I came to briefly
race a Formula One car

62
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,646
The three slowest laps
ever recorded.

63
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,277
Another beautiful day
in Tallahassee.

64
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,529
Good morning, Alonzo

65
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,031
Good morning, Erin

66
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:21,742
How are you?
How's your family doing?

67
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,077
Bye

68
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:28,290
Look at this place. Five rooms
and I get to clean them all

69
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,210
That's right. I'm a
maid for an old lady

70
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,172
Her grandson's staying with us,
too, because he ran out of money

71
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,008
Listen to me,
bragging away

72
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,845
Nellie
Robert

73
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:47,059
How are you adjusting
to life in Scranton so far?

74
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:50,979
So far, so good The water pressure
in the hotel is marvelous

75
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:56,902
It is astounding what a difference
that can make, isn't it?

76
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:57,986
Mm-hmm

77
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,823
Now, let's find you something
fun to do here shall we?

78
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,951
Oh, I've already found it

79
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,788
a natural next step
It fits like a glove.

80
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,373
We have a manager

81
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,793
Do you really?
Because it is 10:00

82
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,753
I've been in this
chair for an hour

83
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,673
and no other manager
has come and sat on my lap

84
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,721
Excuse me has anyone
seen Andy this morning?

85
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,268
Yeah, that's weird He's usually
here by now Right, guys?

86
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,771
Hello?
Andy, it's Robert

87
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,439
Why aren't you at work?

88
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,776
Hey, Robert, I really wish I
could come into work today

89
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,361
but I'm super sick.

90
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,700
Please come to
work immediately

91
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:49,037
Okay, I'll try to come in,
even though I'm really sick

92
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,166
with the Florida flu

93
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,296
He just hung up
on me mid-sentence

94
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,298
I'm in Florida to get Erin

95
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,966
As soon as I heard she wasn't
coming back to Scranton,

96
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,094
and drove straight down
until I hit the ocean.

97
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,887
My heart is my map

98
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,725
Turns out Tallahassee is about
two hundred miles inland,

99
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,394
so I overshot a good amount

100
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,272
But still, not bad
for a heart map, right?

101
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,984
Ew

102
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,404
Thanks a lot, BP

103
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:25,866
Not much we can do about this
until he gets here.

104
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,200
Can't you do
something about this?

105
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,704
Sometimes the flowers
arrange themselves, Jim

106
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,000
Right

107
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,045
What is going on,
and where's Andy?

108
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,464
And what is going on?

109
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,883
Erin, you got a package

110
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,634
ERIN
I'm in the bathroom

111
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,262
Where's the postage? I mean
there's no shipping label

112
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,930
Did you wash your hands?

113
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,599
Yes

114
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:56,438
Here I am, signed, seaped,
delivered I'm yours

115
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,190
Andy, what are you
doing here?

116
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,108
It's great to see you

117
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,069
Ah

118
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,698
Uh, I am here to take
you back to Scranton

119
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,868
because I love you and
I want to be with you.

120
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:11,828
Where's the ring?

121
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,038
Hmm?

122
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,664
Where's the ring, Lancelot?

123
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,209
Would you guys mind if we
talked privately for a second?

124
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,419
Sorry, Glenn

125
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,216
Um

126
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,136
Andy I am so happy to see you

127
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,180
but I'm not
coming back with you

128
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,766
GLENN Why won't she go with him?

129
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,645
I don't know. Maybe it's
because he's not that handsome

130
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:37,813
Hey

131
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,689
Don't listen

132
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,779
So what is going on?

133
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,573
That does seem to be the
question doesn't it?

134
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:54,037
"Hey, this is messed up, bro.
Who is this weird lady?'

135
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,336
So, who knows what's going on?
Anyone?

136
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:05,465
You, yes, wait. I am very
good intuiting names

137
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,136
Is it Chumbo?

138
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,475
A cross between "dumbo'
and "jumbo

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,018
with a hint of "chubby.'

140
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,688
It's not a name

141
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,940
So no one can tell me
what's going on?

142
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:25,235
Well, let me
illuminate things for you

143
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,487
We are getting to
know each other

144
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,198
"But why, my lady?'

145
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,702
Because I am
your new manager

146
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,622
Robert, is Nellie
our new manager?

147
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,168
This is an odd situation

148
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,796
But it's very interesting
how it's playing out.

149
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,967
We live in this world
of routines and rhythms

150
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,471
Kevin ate someone's lunch,
Phyllis has a new necklace

151
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,265
Who is this woman?

152
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:59,311
I came in here simply trying to
get to know you learn your names,

153
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,605
maybe have someone teach me
the company song.

154
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,484
And what I got in return
was nothing but disrespect

155
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,110
You leave me no choice

156
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,987
but to get to know you
in a more intimate way

157
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,322
Hot tub party?

158
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,324
Performance reviews

159
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,076
How can you give us performance
reviews if you don't know us?

160
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:19,372
On first impressions,
so I recommend smiling

161
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,625
It goes a long way with me

162
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,588
Erin, you really
nailed the hotdogs today

163
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,383
Thanks. I've been reusing the hotdog
water, so it gets more flavor.

164
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,135
It's only going to
keep getting better

165
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:38,058
So, Andrew, how does your skinny
brunette girlfriend, Jessica,

166
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,936
feel about you
visiting your ex-girlfriend?

167
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,193
Well, we're not
really dating anymore

168
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,529
so basically, I mean I just have to

169
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,656
cross a few t's and dot
a few I's you know.

170
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:57,077
So you came to get me but you
still have a girlfriend.

171
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:00,038
I think you should leave
young man

172
00:09:00,122 --> 00:09:05,126
All right, technically yes. I am
still technically dating Jessica

173
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,587
But when I realized
that I wanted you back

174
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,632
and I drove down here

175
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,968
and I didn't want to stop
until I saw you

176
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,846
You didn't even stop to pee?
Gross!

177
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,390
Any luck?

178
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:22,060
No, he just keeps letting all
the calls go to voice-mail.

179
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,647
Please leave a message

180
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,900
for Andy Bernard
Include your name...

181
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:33,905
Oh, you're doing so good! Oh, my
God, you're Superman over there

182
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,241
You should take it

183
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,077
It's probably your girlfriend
wondering where you are.

184
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,204
Nope, It's just work
Not important

185
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,123
You know I can really
feel this in my quads.

186
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,583
Getting stronger

187
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,086
You really wouldn't feel those
kinds of results after one session

188
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,132
Just let it vibrate
It's fine.

189
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,092
You could put it
on silent.

190
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,760
I don't think
it does that

191
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,679
Just go to preferences
then click...

192
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,805
Proctology

193
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,307
Andy?

194
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,933
Jim?

195
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,018
Andy, where are you?

196
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,689
I'm home in bed
I've been in bed all day

197
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,613
He's here in Tallahassee trying
to turn my life upside down.

198
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,032
What? You're in Florida?

199
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,326
Andy, Nellie Bertram's
trying to take your job.

200
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,660
What do you mean
take my job?

201
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,037
Like, set up camp
in your office

202
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,163
and is calling
herself the manager.

203
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,539
Okay

204
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,958
Jim, I really appreciate
you looking out for me

205
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,711
but I'm not coming home
without Erin

206
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,046
So, I'll talk to you later

207
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,506
Guys

208
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,177
We cannot do these
performance reviews okay?

209
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,470
If we go into them
you're basically

210
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:39,846
accepting Nellie
as your manager

211
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,057
And trust me You do not
want her as your manager

212
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,516
Trust you?

213
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,228
The way Pam trusted you to provide for
her so she wouldn't have to work?

214
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,940
Dwight
should she be our manager?

215
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,818
I wouldn't let her
manage a celery farm

216
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,363
Those who can't farm
farm celery

217
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,866
And when was the last time Dwight
and I agreed on anything ever?

218
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,869
All right
let's get going

219
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:07,499
First up, it is the woman with the
beautiful fingernails and the tiny feet

220
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,250
Phyllis

221
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,004
Nellie, I'm sorry,
but I don't feel comfortable

222
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,173
being evaluated by
someone I don't know

223
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,341
Oh

224
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,678
Okay. I understand. Let me show
you how these are going to go

225
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,179
Dwight

226
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,973
I refuse to be judged by
someone that I do not respect

227
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,350
I lost respect for you
in Florida.

228
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,644
If it was up to me,
you would be in jail forever

229
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,689
Dwight, I have
completed your evaluation

230
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:31,856
You're getting a raise

231
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:32,982
What?

232
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:37,904
Dwight, you carry this company
on your massive shoulders.

233
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,740
You are our Atlas

234
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,576
and for that do you not
think you deserve a raise?

235
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,870
There's no limit to
what I think I deserve

236
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,955
Then you accept it?

237
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,498
Five percent, no less

238
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,791
Absolutely not

239
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:51,084
Seven percent

240
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,502
Six percent
I know my worth

241
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,129
Raise isn't real

242
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,381
Money isn't real ever since
we got off the gold standard

243
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:59,718
So, Phyllis, now you know
the rules of the game,

244
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,680
do you care to have a go? I'm fairly
certain you're going to like it.

245
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,724
Phyllis

246
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:07,434
Pam

247
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,481
So, Phyllis, I have been
very impressed with you.

248
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,942
Really?
Oh, yeah

249
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,987
The way you conquered your
fear and came in here,

250
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,030
and now the way
you sit there.

251
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,659
All very impressive

252
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,746
Um

253
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,167
Are you aware that Nellie
is giving out raises?

254
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,298
Yeah, she gave one
to Dwight, Phyllis

255
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:40,592
Let me guess,
you want one, too

256
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,719
Take the family
to Disney Town

257
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:43,928
Land! World

258
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,806
It's not that I don't want Well,
yes, I guess I'd take a raise.

259
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,266
That's not what I'm saying
That's not... Sorry.

260
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,480
Jim, I told Andy to come in
and yet he is still not in.

261
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:59,319
By contrast, Nellie Bertram
saw a vacuum and filled it

262
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,530
of her business experience

263
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:06,034
or her relationship
with Jo Bennett, my boss

264
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,037
Jim, would you prefer a nature
metaphor or a sexual metaphor?

265
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,288
Oh, God, nature, please

266
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:12,332
When two animals
are having sex,

267
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:15,794
one of them is communicating
a message to the other.

268
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,046
Nothing is
This isn't very helpful

269
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,507
You're going to want
to hear the sexual metaphor

270
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,591
Was that not the

271
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,011
All life is sex

272
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,473
And all sex is competition

273
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,766
Mmm-hmm

274
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,810
And there are no
rules to that game

275
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,521
That wasn't so perverted
now was it?

276
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,231
Was that it?
No, that wasn't bad

277
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:42,028
My point is there is one person in
charge of every office in America.

278
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:44,489
And that person
is Charles Darwin

279
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:48,368
In the end, doesn't he
decide who the manager is?

280
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:55,583
No. I would have said no

281
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,297
Hmm. Let's see. Review, review,
review Yes, good stuff.

282
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,715
Here you go, have a raise

283
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,175
Oh, great

284
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,971
and take these raises,
what are we saying?

285
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:11,224
That it's okay for someone to
just take someone else's job?

286
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,600
Shouldn't work like that

287
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,186
No, you know what?
Nellie's right.

288
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,522
That is exactly
how it should work

289
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,024
Darryl,
this office is mine now

290
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:25,446
No.
Yes

291
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,158
Yes. Sorry it's too late, I'm here.
This is mine. Back off

292
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,870
Ow! Ow

293
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,456
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow

294
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,548
Well fought!
I accept the outcome

295
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,553
Touch me and I'll sue

296
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,850
I've heard that's
amazing when it works

297
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,059
Yeah. If I had my own

298
00:14:55,144 --> 00:14:56,603
Andy, I care about
you and I think...

299
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,563
Sorry. You go

300
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,689
No, go ahead

301
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:01,608
Well I was just
going to say that

302
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,359
if I had my own fountain
it would be two frogs

303
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:05,445
and they're spitting
into each other's mouth

304
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,323
It's just stupid. What
were you going to say?

305
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,199
Andy, you broke my heart

306
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,621
Do you know what it feels like
to be constantly rejected by you

307
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:18,207
and to have to watch
you date someone else?

308
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:19,918
You broke my heart, too

309
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:24,005
You broke my heart more
recently and more often.

310
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,052
And I think at some point in my
head it just sort of clicked

311
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:31,220
that we're not
meant to be.

312
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,312
I'm so sorry that we have not loved
each other at the same time.

313
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,292
So, Pamela, I'm going to
start this review

314
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,419
not by telling you
what you lack

315
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:06,547
but rather asking you
what it is you want

316
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,092
Really? Okay, we

317
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,635
Um

318
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:16,307
I like consistency in the manager's
position No weird silent coups

319
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,684
Stuff like that
I'm easy

320
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,018
That's not
really what you want

321
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,397
What you want is a good night's
sleep, working mother of two

322
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,606
Whoa

323
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,777
That's kind of condescending Would
you say something like that to Jim?

324
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,238
Does Jim
have to breastfeed?

325
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,367
Did Jim carry around those babies
for what is it, 12 months?

326
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,244
Be honest Does Jim really
get up in the night?

327
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:40,540
Well, I mean, the only reason he
doesn't is because I'm breastfeeding

328
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,500
and Philip
doesn't like a bottle

329
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,419
You must be exhausted

330
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,587
Fancy a nap?

331
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,506
No

332
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,383
Go on. Have a nap

333
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,180
Lie down right here

334
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,392
There's a blanket in here

335
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,773
Dreamt I could breathe
underwater like Jacques Cousteau

336
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,195
No one will know

337
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,115
I'll wake you up

338
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,121
When you wake up,
you will earn more money

339
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:29,630
I think you're amazing
You know that, right?

340
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:35,386
Go on. Say it,
"I'm amazing.'

341
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,097
I'm amazing

342
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,860
Erin, I think you're making
a big mistake right now

343
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:53,738
Andy is a nice boy

344
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,325
Really? Because you've been kind
of a "B" to him all afternoon

345
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,870
I was protecting you because
I thought he was no good

346
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,498
But I can tell
you really like him

347
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,833
And he's willing to
lose his job for you

348
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,461
In this economy,
with Europe on the brink

349
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,880
Irene what would
you do without me?

350
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,466
We're not your concern
sweetheart

351
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,761
Besides, Glenn's
going to sue Home Depot

352
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:17,887
Why?

353
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,432
He got his foreskin caught
in some lawn furniture.

354
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:24,268
Jim, time for
your review.

355
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,854
No, it's not, because you
don't really work here.

356
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,190
Why are you so
staunchly defending

357
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,609
your friend who
has abandoned you?

358
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:37,657
Wouldn't you rather come talk with
me maybe, definitely get a raise?

359
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:38,783
See, that's the thing

360
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,493
can even give raises

361
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:44,497
Jim, have you ever heard of a
character named Tinker Bell?

362
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,208
Yes
I'm Tinker Bell

363
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,876
No

364
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,922
I'm a magical fairy
who floated into your office

365
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:58,678
to bring a little bit of magic into
your lives to give you all raises

366
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,513
And we are grateful

367
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,808
But here's the thing
about Tinker Bell, Jim

368
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:08,104
everyone has to believe in her
or she doesn't exist.

369
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,939
And then she dies.
She dies

370
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:15,820
Now who here
believes in Tinker Bell?

371
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,197
Let's see it. Show of hands!
I do

372
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,702
Come on, everyone

373
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,078
All right, guys, stop

374
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:26,038
How?

375
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,541
Come on,
Jim, you're killing her

376
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,667
We believe

377
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,086
We believe

378
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,299
Look at this
wonderful recognition

379
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,759
of Nellie's leadership I believe!

380
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,936
That did not go
how I wanted it to

381
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,606
Ugh

382
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,234
I have a whole ton of Erin's
favorite food for the drive back.

383
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,944
Eggplant parm

384
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,950
It's biodegradable
Animals will eat it

385
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,787
Andy, wait! Andy

386
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,248
Andy, wait! Andy, don't go

387
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,958
Andy, I love you! Stop

388
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,921
Oh. This is the wrong Prius
I don't love you.

389
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,297
Erin
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,551
Andy

391
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,525
Let's get out of here

392
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,568
Okay.
Let's go

393
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,320
Wait, we have to go back
and get your stuff.

394
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,488
No, I don't have
any stuff.

395
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,323
Like your toothbrush and stuff.
I don't have one

396
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,325
You don't have a toothbrush? No

397
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,246
How do you not
have a toothbrush?

398
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,081
I just there's
always one around.

399
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,249
You just use whichever
one is sitting there?

400
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,001
Have you ever heard
of buying a toothbrush?

401
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,879
Of course,
I own my toothbrush

402
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,427
I grew up poor. I had little
formal education, no real skills.

403
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,763
I don't work
especially hard

404
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:09,433
and most of my ideas are either
unoriginal or total crap.

405
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,603
And yet, I walked right into a job

406
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,481
for which I was
ill-prepared, ill-suited,

407
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,110
and somebody else already
had, and I got it.

408
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:23,322
If you ask me, that's the
American dream right there

409
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:26,242
Anything can happen
to anyone.

410
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,036
It's just random
