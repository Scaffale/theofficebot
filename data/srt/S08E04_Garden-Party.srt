1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:05,295
Hey. So we saw
a new billboard.

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,589
Yeah. Pretty cool, huh?

3
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:10,843
What better way to announce
our new slightly lower prices

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,845
than with an ad campaign?

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,224
And what better face for an ad campaign
than our new regional manager?

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:19,768
How'd it look?
You've seen it, right?

7
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,271
No. Andy, somebody defaced it.

8
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,857
What? How?

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:27,317
Morning, Stanley

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,866
There's this thing that people
tend to do with billboards

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,743
How do I put this?

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:42,374
If there's an opportunity for a graffiti
artist to work in a phallic shape

13
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,919
interacting with the
artwork, it'll happen.

14
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:49,631
And Andy gave them
that opportunity.

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,884
Erin, how long did we order
those billboards for?

16
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,761
Six months
Oh, God.

17
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,429
I need you to call
the billboard company

18
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,767
great billboard. Funny, edgy right up to
the line without crossing it. Loved it.

19
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,518
Which one did you see?
Washington Street

20
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:04,271
The one with like 20 dongs on it.
Okay. Don't be gross

21
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,565
What's going on? Somebody
defaced the billboards

22
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:09,318
we just put out
in an inappropriate way

23
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,195
That's funny

24
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:16,200
Wait, from the photo
shoot with you and me?

25
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,618
Yeah, Dwight

26
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,162
No. No

27
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:29,505
No, no, no, no, no, no

28
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:33,842
No, no, no, no, no. No

29
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,992
Schrute Farms
is very easy to find.

30
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,911
It's right in the middle of
the root vegetable district

31
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,287
If the soil starts
to get acidic

32
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,622
you've probably
gone too far.

33
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,499
Just give us the address
we'll look it up online

34
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,459
It's simpler this way.
It's really not

35
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,212
Now stated arrival
time is 3:00 p.m.

36
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:13,090
I don't get the reason for this party.
Yeah. What's the reason?

37
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,175
What's the reason, Andy?
What's the reason?

38
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,719
It's just a garden party Sheesh!

39
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,972
You don't need a reason
to throw a garden party

40
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,392
any more than you need a reason
to throw a birthday party

41
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,395
It's a garden party
You don't need a reason

42
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,398
A few other super simple reminders.
No burping, no slurping

43
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,734
When eating, take small bites and chew
thoroughly with your mouth closed

44
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,986
Yes, Darryl?

45
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,529
What happens when
we're done chewing?

46
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,907
Do we spit it out on the floor or keep
it in our mouths the rest of the time?

47
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,826
I get it. I'm being
a little overbearing

48
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,744
But I promise to be
under-bearing for a week

49
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,581
if you guys just
all step it up.

50
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,833
Andy, we understand basic table
manners We're not children.

51
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,251
Yeah. It's just
a picnic

52
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,337
This is not a picnic, Phyllis
It's a garden party.

53
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,006
There's a grill in the
warehouse I could bring

54
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,383
Oh, ew Please don't.
Not a barbecue

55
00:02:56,467 --> 00:03:00,470
It's better than a barbecue It's dignified.
Quieter. There are rules.

56
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,722
How is that better
than a barbecue?

57
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,308
What's the dress code for this?
I'm glad you asked

58
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,517
Connecticut casual

59
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,770
Any chance Connecticut casual
is Pennsylvania business?

60
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,939
I.E., this is what
I'm wearing to your party

61
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,484
guys, my family just threw a garden party
to celebrate my brother's promotion.

62
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,986
It was a huge success

63
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,487
Check it out.
There's a video online

64
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,991
Heartwarming impromptu
father/son duet

65
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,534
Oh, yeah

66
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,952
Yeah. Oscar
you showed me this

67
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,454
I've seen this.
That's not you

68
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,997
Yeah. Who's the sausage?

69
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,665
It's my dad
and my brother

70
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,375
I would have joined in
but this melody

71
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,712
doesn't really support
another harmony part, so

72
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,088
Check it out
That's my brother's boss

73
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,382
Look how psyched he is
He's having an awesome time

74
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,508
Ah

75
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:41,386
And did Robert California
get an invite to your party?

76
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,514
Yeah, of course I mean,
yeah I think he did

77
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,644
Why didn't you just say this was
to impress Robert California?

78
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:53,690
I cannot believe that Andy is throwing a
party like this just to impress the CEO.

79
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,692
Classic Gabe move

80
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:58,779
Hey, Andy, how about you don't
steal my business strategies

81
00:03:58,863 --> 00:04:02,324
and I won't dress like my life
is just one long brunch

82
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,494
See you all there at 3:00
p.m Connecticut casual

83
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,746
Remember your manners
and have a wonderful time

84
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,458
And please refer to the map
Stay off of the web.

85
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,210
Thank you

86
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,629
So, we've typed in
the address.

87
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,881
Now let's take a look
at the street view

88
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,512
They don't warn you when the
cameras are driving by Ah.

89
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:26,223
Why do you keep reading
that garden party book?

90
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:28,517
I mean, how hard are
finger sandwiches and tea?

91
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,644
There's so much
more to it than that

92
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,437
I've been wanting
Schrute Farms to break into

93
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,606
the high-end event hosting
industry for some time,

94
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,276
and this party is
a great opportunity

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,653
Plus, I've got
a secret weapon

96
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,572
Only one copy
in the world,

97
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:46,034
and some sucker on the
Internet sold it to me for $2

98
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:52,249
I'm actually really disappointed
in how poorly my book is doing.

99
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,293
I've only sold one copy

100
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,547
Is there anything you wish you'd
done differently to avoid cankles?

101
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,549
Nope

102
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,967
I've already gone up
another cup size.

103
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,553
The senator
is grossed out

104
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,514
When do you start
feeling it kick?

105
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:11,226
Cece was around 22 weeks
but Philip was much earlier

106
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,561
Philip?

107
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:17,649
Oh, my gosh. Yes But don't
say anything, okay?

108
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,151
It's after my grandfather

109
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,403
Philip is the name
that we're using.

110
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,946
It's after my favourite cat

111
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,323
Oh, wow

112
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,825
Funny. It's after
my grandfather.

113
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,244
It's after my cat

114
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,831
Andrew, I picked up two possible
gifts to bring this afternoon.

115
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,583
One, a pot of marmalade.

116
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,543
Ooh, that sounds great

117
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,420
That is what you want then?
The marmalade?

118
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,671
Sure

119
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,967
You don't want to hearthe otherone.
You love marmalade?

120
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,969
I'll hear the other one

121
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,429
It's a basil plant.

122
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,807
You know, the marmalade
sounds great.

123
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,812
I also mentioned the marmalade to my
sister, and she's very interested.

124
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,773
Then the basil will be fine

125
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,066
Well, you clearly want
the marmalade.

126
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,277
Gretchen, I need
another marmalade.

127
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,904
All right.

128
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,289
Hey, where do I park?
I'm the valet.

129
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,000
You have to give me your car, I'm parking.
I can probably park it myself

130
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,543
I'm the valet. You have
to give me your car.

131
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,920
It's probably okay
that I park...

132
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,005
No. I think it's
probably better that I

133
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,673
I'm the valet.
You have to give me

134
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,135
It's a finicky car Get out of your car.
Get out.

135
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,849
Have a good time
at the thing.

136
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,644
It's a little tricky.
You might want to

137
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,624
Mr. Ryan Howard

138
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,377
"Chapter Two. Announcing
guests as they enter

139
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,087
"is the height of decorum

140
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:06,883
"The more volume displayed the more honour
is bestowed upon everyone present."

141
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,179
Stanley Hudson
and his mistress Cynthia

142
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:17,853
James, Pamela
and Peepee Halpert

143
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,524
How's it going over here, guys?
Andy, stop hovering

144
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:23,608
You're being
really annoying

145
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,193
Didn't mean
to bother you, Mable

146
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,113
"Mable, Mable
if you're able,

147
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,699
"keep your elbows
off the table." Wow

148
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:35,036
Mr. and Mrs. Walter
and Ellen Bernard

149
00:07:37,248 --> 00:07:39,291
So you all work
with Andy?

150
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,712
Well, technically, for Andy

151
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,090
Technically for Robert
California He's our CEO.

152
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,469
I thought you
were the CEO

153
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,636
I don't know how
you got there

154
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,430
You said you were
running the company

155
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,557
This branch
I'm the regional manager

156
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,726
Yes. Well, that makes
more sense.

157
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,061
Are you a
regional managers?

158
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,441
Did I throw this party to impress
my parents? That's crazy

159
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,694
No, if they wanted a garden party,
they could throw one themselves.

160
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,821
Which, as a matter of fact,
they did last week.

161
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,742
They threw one for my baby brother,
and it was totally amazing.

162
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,911
But I couldn't care less.

163
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,914
Can I introduce
you around now?

164
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,667
Yeah, we don't have too long
We have theatre tickets.

165
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,877
What are you
going to see?

166
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,253
Moneyball.

167
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,257
It was
Walter Jr.'s choice

168
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,592
MRS. BERNARD There he is. What?

169
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:31,927
Bro-nard

170
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,012
I didn't know you were
going to be here

171
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,597
I wouldn't have missed it

172
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:37,599
Okay

173
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,603
Ahh

174
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,522
I'm Walter. I'm Andy's
younger brother

175
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,232
Hey, how you doing?
I'm Jim.

176
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:51,738
Tuna, right? And this must
be your lovely wife, Pam

177
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:52,822
No
Hell no

178
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:56,451
She wishes. No, no, no no, no.
No

179
00:08:56,953 --> 00:09:00,539
Sir, I need to be able to feed
all the guests I understand

180
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,957
Excuse me

181
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,128
Set that down

182
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,135
Present yourself

183
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,158
"Chapter Four One of the
host's most important duties

184
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,827
"is as dance master.

185
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,415
"A proper courtly dance sets the
tone for the entire afternoon."

186
00:09:56,846 --> 00:10:00,140
Ladies and gentlemen
may I present

187
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,811
Robert California

188
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,358
Hello, Andy
Welcome

189
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,193
Thank you
Hey, I want you to meet

190
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,280
my first bosses
Mom and Dad

191
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:17,198
Yes. Hello. Nice to
meet you Pleasure.

192
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,036
Andy, where shall I put
your basil plant?

193
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,288
I thought you were going
to bring the marmalade?

194
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,041
No. I'm certain
you said basil.

195
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,963
This is not funny, man
Let me down.

196
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,884
I think this thing is broken. It's not
broken, Kevin This is how it works.

197
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,889
It's so pretty today

198
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,807
It's getting chilly

199
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,101
Yeah. We really
should be leaving

200
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,519
Yeah. Um

201
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,606
It'll be weird if the boss-man
didn't make a toast, so hang on.

202
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:54,486
Everybody, I just want to take this
opportunity to thank you all for coming

203
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,115
and to raise a glass
to my amazing staff

204
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,951
Toasts are great.
I mean, you toast somebody

205
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,454
they toast you back
It just goes round and round

206
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:07,582
That's my favourite part
about toasts, the reciprocity

207
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,085
Let's hear from you guys.
Who do you want to toast?

208
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,169
Yeah, I'll say something

209
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,173
I think we should be
acknowledging our boss

210
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,425
because none of us
would be here without him

211
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:18,927
Robert California

212
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,012
To Robert
- Yay, Robert

213
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:27,435
I cannot believe I didn't think of
toasting Robert. Get in the game, Gabriel

214
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,688
Why are you talking
to Stanley's mistress?

215
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,649
I would like to toast
someone who isn't here

216
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,984
but who will be
in just four short months

217
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,155
Welcome to the world
Philip Lipton.

218
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,448
Aww

219
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,205
I also would like
to toast Philip Halpert

220
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,915
who's due even sooner

221
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,460
May he be a good namesake
to my grandfather

222
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:57,465
who I promised as a child
long before tonight,

223
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,468
that I would one day
name my son after him

224
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,638
To Philip Halpert.
To Philip

225
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,723
All right

226
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,309
She just always has
to copy anything I do

227
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,855
It's the Ford Taurus
situation all over again

228
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,524
I'd like to make
a toast to the troops

229
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,650
Here, here
Yes

230
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:18,445
All the troops
Both sides

231
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:22,073
I think
we should toast

232
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:25,160
Ladies and gentlemen
the Last Supper.

233
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:33,752
"Chapter Nine The tableau
vivant is not only welcome

234
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,630
"but expected entertainment
at any garden party."

235
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:39,883
Andy?

236
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,594
I think that we should
acknowledge the man

237
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,180
who has led us to such
a profitable quarter.

238
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,184
To Robert California
Yeah

239
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,396
I would also like to toast Robert
California Mr. California...

240
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,815
You can't triple
toast somebody

241
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,860
At least not until
we hit everyone once

242
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,780
I'll say a few words if that's
all right with you, Andy

243
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,531
Yeah

244
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,038
You people say I led you
but it wasn't me

245
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,335
You want to toast the man
who led you to success,

246
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:17,295
but the boss is irrelevant

247
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,132
Andy and I produce
nothing We do nothing

248
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,385
We sit in our offices
and demand,

249
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,807
"I want this and that right
now" like petulant children

250
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:33,019
You know the difference between
a crying baby and a manager?

251
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,771
One day the baby
will grow up.

252
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:43,488
But without you, Andy and I would
be sitting in our dirty diapers

253
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,407
waiting for someone
to change us, wipe us

254
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,702
I should be toasting you
thanking you,

255
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,998
for allowing me to have the
easiest job in the universe.

256
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:56,209
Cheers
- Cheers

257
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,419
To Robert California

258
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,964
From the moment you entered our
building and our hearts, you...

259
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:05,885
Some of you know that we have
an Internet star in our midst.

260
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,431
Mr. Walter Banes Bernard, Sir
please report to the stage.

261
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:12,267
I'm eating, Andy

262
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,185
Come on

263
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:17,647
Okay. All right

264
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,065
Okay

265
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,900
Yes Yeah, what do
you want to do?

266
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,362
Well, how about one of our
classic father/son duets?

267
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:26,364
Oh, whoa.

268
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,490
You sure?

269
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,076
Really?
It's a little tricky

270
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:39,502
Saying I love you
Is not the words

271
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,713
It's too high. It's high but
it's not that high. Really?

272
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,007
Right. It feels strained
Yeah. Just take it down.

273
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,094
Saying I love...

274
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,929
Saying I love you

275
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,223
Here. Just give it to me.
Yeah Yeah

276
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,433
Okay

277
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,520
Something like

278
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,734
Saying I love you
is not the word...

279
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:03,860
You don't come in yet

280
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:06,571
...I want to hear from you

281
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,908
It's not that I want you

282
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:14,537
Not to say
but if you only knew

283
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,540
More than words

284
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:22,295
Is all you have to do
to make it real

285
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,798
Is anyone filming this?
Seriously. Erin!

286
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,259
It's either taping
or calling.

287
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,764
What would you do

288
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:36,184
If my heart was torn in two

289
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,686
You know what?
Walter Jr. is here

290
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,271
Why don't you come up and join us?
- Yeah, no

291
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,023
No, come up and do something with me.
I don't know, Pop

292
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,108
I'm just having a good time getting
to know Andy's friends here

293
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,401
Get up there and sing

294
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,321
or I will cut your larynx and
you'll never be able to sing again

295
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,031
Whoo! Come on

296
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,825
Come on
Give them what they want

297
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,745
All right. This old thing
I don't even

298
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:01,501
May the good Lord be with you
Down every road you roam

299
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:09,092
And may sunshine and happiness
Surround you when you're far from home

300
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:16,182
And may you grow to be proud
Dignified and true

301
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:22,981
And do unto others
As you'd have done to you

302
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,776
Cheers! All right

303
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,655
What's going on? Cheers, cheers.
Get your own guitar

304
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,123
Sorry. Please hang
up and try again.

305
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,446
I am so cold It's because
you didn't bring a jacket

306
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:15,158
My first love is beet farming,
but it's a young man's game

307
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,828
Whoever heard of an old beet farmer?
Forget the beets.

308
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,080
Concentrate on the hosting

309
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:26,252
I can spend a considerable amount of
money having my birthday party here

310
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,796
Really? We have a number
of birthday packages

311
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,549
The Pewter package has the
least amount of goats.

312
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,135
It's not no goats
it's still 10 to 12 goats

313
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,595
depending on the
availability of the goats

314
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,931
Now the goat package, obviously, has
the most goats What were you thinking?

315
00:17:40,976 --> 00:17:43,061
Of course I am not
interested in goats

316
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,230
Why would you spend so much time
going over the goats with me?

317
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,026
I can get you
exotic meats

318
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,196
Hippo steaks.
Giraffe burgers

319
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,406
We'll talk

320
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,953
It'll all be goat

321
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:05,208
Hello, Cece Halpert
This is Andrew Bernard

322
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:09,087
I'd very much like to speak with
you about your paper supply needs

323
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,883
That wasn't even
my worst sales call

324
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,511
Hi

325
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,474
What was that display?

326
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,686
I don't know.
I just thought

327
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,231
if I could throw
this great garden party

328
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,026
and show you how respected I
am that you'd be proud of me

329
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,320
Andrew
I know

330
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,322
I know that you're
proud of me.

331
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,449
I'm not going to tell you
how impressed I am

332
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,787
that you're a manager
of some rinky-dink branch

333
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:45,790
of a paper company
in Scranton, Pennsylvania

334
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,835
How long are you going to
go on needing my approval?

335
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,713
You're a grown man. Don't act
like a little boy who needs...

336
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,675
I think if I had
parents like that,

337
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,011
I'd be trying to convince everyone
all the time how great I was, too

338
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,556
Guess we found Andy's
Rosebud Rosebud?

339
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,974
It's a reference
to Citizen Kane.

340
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,185
Something that explains why a
person became the way they are.

341
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,565
I know Citizen Kane. Rosebud didn't
explain why he was how he was

342
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,277
It just represented what was important
to him as a child, that he missed.

343
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,154
Different school of thought.
Let's just agree to disagree

344
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,905
No. You're wrong

345
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,868
Are you sure?
Yeah. I'm too hot anyway

346
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,246
My body has somehow become
acclimated to southern Italy

347
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,581
Isn't that strange?
I've never been there

348
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,001
Oh! Ah. Well

349
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,294
Yes, that's nice

350
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,712
Thank you

351
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:39,760
It was a nice party. The setting
was a little strange. The food

352
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,095
Sandwiches were dry

353
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,847
Bye, Tuna
Bye, Pam

354
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,066
Hey, everybody
I'm going to leave

355
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:57,278
and I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry

356
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,197
Cheeseburger
or hamburger?

357
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,242
Um

358
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,953
Cheeseburger

359
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,330
Nard-Dog

360
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,792
Thanks, Oscar

361
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,229
What are they doing?

362
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,022
Closing ceremonies

363
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,149
Nice touch

364
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,920
I think I left my wallet in your house.
Who cares?

365
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,048
Right here
Mr. James Halpert

366
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,341
Keys. My keys

367
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,177
Stop forgetting things. I didn't
forget them They're right here.

368
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:06,472
Mr. James Halpert

369
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,059
I'm so sorry.
I think I forgot the

370
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,644

Mi.

373
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,111
What are you doing?
Hey, I have a question

374
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,406
Who do you think is really the
best salesman in this office?

375
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,201
Stupid question, obviously
Mr. James Halpert!
