1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,802
Sorry, mate.

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,931
Excuse me, mate.
What are you...

3
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,031
What are you doing?
English?

4
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:09,872
If you're taking the
mickey, you picked
on the wrong person.

5
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:11,639
Let me tell you that.
No, I'm not picking
on you at all.

6
00:00:11,712 --> 00:00:13,271
You're English, correct?
Yeah, big time, yeah.

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,781
I'm working on
an English character.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,841
Would you mind...
It's called
Reginald Poofter.

9
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,181
Oh.

10
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:21,484
David Brent,
my liege.
How are you?

11
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:23,217
Michael Scott.
Oh, bloody hell.

12
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,055
I do characters as well.
I got a Chinese fella.

13
00:00:26,126 --> 00:00:28,152
Not politically correct,
but he's called Holy...

14
00:00:28,228 --> 00:00:29,992
That's what it
sounds like.

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,958
"Herro! Herro!"
I do Ping.

16
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:33,863
"Herro. I'm Ping."
You can't do
that these days.

17
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:34,958
You can't.
I'm Ping! No.

18
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:37,561
No, no. And people
don't understand

19
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:41,837
that it has nothing to
do with making fun of
a different nationality.

20
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,572
No, no, no.
No, comedy is a place

21
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,547
where the mind goes
to tickle itself.

22
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:49,344
That's what she
said.

23
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:54,952
That's good.
Pleasure to meet you.

24
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:56,422
Where are you working?
Dunder Mifflin.

25
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,456
Any jobs going?
No, not right now.

26
00:00:58,525 --> 00:00:59,652
Just let me know.
All right.

27
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,752
See you around.

28
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,291
Bye, bye.

29
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:05,724
What a nice guy.

30
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,957
Your first student is
here, Mr. Bernard.

31
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:36,053
That's actually
"Master of Ceremonies"
Bernard.

32
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,597
Last year,
I went to a seminar

33
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,064
called "The 10 Secrets
of Real Estate."

34
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:42,500
Turns out it was
just a ploy to sell me
timeshares in Idaho.

35
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,767
Cut to, you know,
I'm spending a
weekend in Boise,

36
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:47,637
terrible time,
super lonely.

37
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,006
<i>But I get to thinking,</i>

38
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:53,411
<i>maybe I should put</i>
<i>on my own seminar</i>
<i>to lure clients.</i>

39
00:01:53,647 --> 00:01:54,637
Oh.

40
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,248
Hello, I am here
for the small
business seminar.

41
00:02:03,724 --> 00:02:05,693
Michael?
<i>Nein,</i> I'm Greek!

42
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,193
My name is Mykonos.

43
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:08,353
Ooh.

44
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:09,623
Oh.

45
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,523
Wait, Michael?

46
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:12,889
Michael?
Okay.

47
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,026
I am the plant.

48
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,730
Every great seminar has one.

49
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,294
My job is to make
the speaker look good,

50
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:22,173
and I do this
through the techniques
of leading questions

51
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:25,007
and laughing at all jokes.

52
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:28,105
And the character, Mykonos,
is just a little added flavor.

53
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:32,846
Mykonos is loosely
based on another
character I do, Spiros,

54
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,484
who is more about the ladies.

55
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,625
Thank you so much,
Tuna Turner.

56
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,159
You are simply
the best.

57
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,123
Listen,
this isn't a favor,
all right?

58
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,594
This is a good idea.
We all win.

59
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,653
Go higher.
All right.

60
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,790
I get super flexible
when I'm nervous.

61
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:46,890
Wow.

62
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:49,801
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop.

63
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,898
Hey, Andy,
I'm really, really
sorry to do this to you,

64
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:55,602
but I have
a meeting today

65
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,471
that I totally forgot,

66
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,978
so I can't be a part
of this seminar.

67
00:02:59,046 --> 00:03:00,173
No! What?

68
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,945
You can't do that.
You are a critical
part of this seminar.

69
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,507
You're the charming
warm-up guy.
I know.

70
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,951
If the seminar was
a meal, you'd be
the amuse-bouche.

71
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,683
You signal the flavors
of the whole night.
I'm really sorry.
I can't do it.

72
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:10,746
You can't. You can't.

73
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,588
I can't have
this go badly.

74
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,683
I'm a terrible salesman,

75
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:16,490
<i>and I haven't been</i>
<i>making very many</i>
<i>sales lately, or ever.</i>

76
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,532
<i>This is my only</i>
<i>idea on how to</i>
<i>turn things around.</i>

77
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,430
<i>If it goes badly,</i>
<i>I might lose my job,</i>

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,299
which would suck,
because this is the only
job I've ever been good at.

79
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,672
Will you let me
know when this whole
seminar thing's over?

80
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,774
What's going on?
Do you know that guy?

81
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,904
I just have a meeting,
outside the office.

82
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,411
Hey.

83
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,340
How are the marks?

84
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:37,145
What are some of your
small business ideas?

85
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,619
I was thinking we could
buy up a bunch of
abandoned mineshafts.

86
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:42,155
ALL:

87
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,054
That's great.
There's a big,

88
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,490
big future in that.
WOMAN: A lot of mines
in Scranton.

89
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,822
DWIGHT: Um,
what about you?

90
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:48,657
Uh, credit cards.
Uh-huh.

91
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,891
My company will act
as an inter-medium

92
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,865
for, like, 0.2 cents
off every transaction.

93
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:53,923
Wow!

94
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:54,990
Or something
with cell phones,

95
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,561
like, every time you
make a phone call,
I'd make 0.2 cents.

96
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:02,173
Or anything. Like,
any online shopping,
I get 0.2 cents basically.

97
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,471
Right. Okay?
Yeah.

98
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,533
Okay.

99
00:04:05,378 --> 00:04:07,074
You promised us whales.
These are worms.

100
00:04:07,147 --> 00:04:09,707
They're not worms,
Dwight, okay?

101
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:12,048
They're just people
with tiny businesses.

102
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:14,611
They're baby whales,
which is even cuter.
I'm out.

103
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,414
Stanley, you're
supposed to close.

104
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,480
I'm out, too.

105
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:18,819
What?

106
00:04:18,892 --> 00:04:20,326
I already lost Jim.

107
00:04:20,527 --> 00:04:21,995
Salesmen are supposed
to help each other out.

108
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,189
We're supposed to be a team.

109
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,287
We're no more a team

110
00:04:24,364 --> 00:04:27,732
than the people
staying in the same
hotel are a team.

111
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:29,427
You know what
might be kind of fun?

112
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:32,598
I was thinking,
you know, Andy's having
a seminar today?

113
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,664
What if we went in
as a Greek couple?

114
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,006
Mykonos and...
Oh, I don't
know, Michael.

115
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,739
I'm not feeling
up to that.
Okay.

116
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,804
MICHAEL: <i>Holly broke</i>
<i>up with A. J. last week,</i>

117
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:45,114
which is the greatest
thing that has ever
happened to me.

118
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:47,882
To Holly, it's been the
worst week of her life,

119
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:52,085
and I know for a fact
that there was a week
for her in High School

120
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:56,028
when she got mono
and her first period ever.

121
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,725
Too much information?
That's what I thought.

122
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:02,361
But you know what?
Here I am using it.

123
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:07,499
If you change your
mind, why don't you
talk to Mykonos?

124
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,343
Is Mykonos Greek?
He sounds Italian.

125
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,741
Ugh. You're the fifth person
to tell me that today.

126
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,647
Maybe Mykonos ran away
to join the Italian circus.

127
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,775
Okay, yeah, like
a character history.

128
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:19,911
Good. Tom Hanks does that.

129
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,150
Yeah.

130
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:27,023
Is "JLP" a word?

131
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,530
"Jelp?" J-E-L-P?
No, J-L-P.

132
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:32,858
Like, "I Jlp...
I Jlp you!"

133
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,191
I don't think
that's a word.

134
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,032
I'm playing
scrabble with Gabe,

135
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:39,129
and I've never
won a game.

136
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:43,007
The winner gets to pick
the movie we watch.
I have won no games.

137
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:46,513
So far I've seen
<i>The Shining,</i>

138
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,778
<i>Rosemary's Baby,</i>
<i>The Ring.</i>

139
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:52,381
Not really my thing.

140
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,851
Although, I...
I do like the early
parts of the movies

141
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,756
where they have
a perfect family
and everything.

142
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,084
You want some help?

143
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:01,951
Really?

144
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,018
Mmm-hmm.

145
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,455
Yes.

146
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:08,927
K-A. "Ka?"
What does "ka" mean?

147
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:12,733
It means you're
playing someone who's
going to destroy you.

148
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:14,800
Why did you play "moo?"

149
00:06:14,908 --> 00:06:16,376
Because I'm
playing to win.

150
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,811
I'm playing "moo,"
I'm playing "milk,"
whatever it takes.

151
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,679
Okay, but look,
you could have
hit "mood."

152
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:25,375
Would have played
a... A triple word.
Ah.

153
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,081
Like the cow
mood yesterday.

154
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:29,178
God.

155
00:06:29,256 --> 00:06:30,417
Or moon.

156
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,659
The cow jumped
over the moon.

157
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,989
She's stuck on
that one thing.

158
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,790
You know it doesn't
have to just be cow
stuff, right?

159
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:40,624
Kevin, Jim dropped
out of my seminar,
and I'm just...

160
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,192
I was wondering if you
could replace him as
my charming warm-up guy.

161
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,001
Andy, I'm no Jim. I'm...

162
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,042
The only way
that I'm Jim is in
the movie version

163
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:53,547
when Jim sees what
his future would be like
if he never met Pam.

164
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:57,584
Hey, that's crazy talk.
I think you're great.

165
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,644
Then I won't let you down.

166
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
Pink.
Indigo.

167
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:04,350
Hi, Ryan, you
went to business
school, right?

168
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,448
Yeah.
I need somebody

169
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,925
to talk to this
seminar about business.

170
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:08,723
And?

171
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:09,785
Okay.

172
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:13,265
I don't...
I don't like committing
to things just like that.

173
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,323
So, no?

174
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:17,599
No, I don't like
committing to not
doing things, either.

175
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:20,038
That's just as big
a commitment.
Oh, baby.

176
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:22,098
What do I put you
down for, bro <i>hombre?</i>

177
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,533
Yes.

178
00:07:23,743 --> 00:07:24,767
All right!
Yes, I'll do it.

179
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:27,109
Okay, thank you so much.
It's gonna be awesome.

180
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,876
And if I flake,
I flake.
What?

181
00:07:29,749 --> 00:07:31,411
Kevin, you
open it up.
Yep.

182
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:33,919
Ryan, you come in
with your small biz
expertise, right?

183
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:37,389
And then Creed,
guest speaker
extraordinaire.

184
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,490
And then I come in
and just close all
the sales and stuff.

185
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,554
Okay, here we go.

186
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,293
One, two, three!

187
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:47,800
Team!
Creed!

188
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,564
Welcome everybody.
Awesome to see you guys.

189
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,768
My name's Andy Bernard,
but you can call me
"The Nard Dog."

190
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,845
Hi, Nard Dog.
I'm Lu Peachem.

191
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,347
Let's get things
started, shall we?

192
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:03,974
You guys ready to hear
from the Dunder Mifflin
business experts?

193
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,178
Good. Well, as you can
see on your program,

194
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:10,121
first up is a speech called,
"Don't just dream it, do it."

195
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:14,355
Yes! Please give
a big hand to
Mr. Kevin Malone.

196
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,412
Four, five.

197
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,420
Yes!

198
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:54,526
There are some people
who have charm

199
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:56,968
and some people
who don't.

200
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,903
Guess which type I am.

201
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:01,472
Charm type.

202
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:06,606
Dream big. Right?

203
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:10,241
So, what I
want you to do

204
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:13,878


205
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:23,288
And then double it!

206
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:34,700
Are you okay?
No. Yes!

207
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,265
Here.
Mmm-hmm.

208
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,038
I'm fine.

209
00:09:38,111 --> 00:09:40,945
Okay, from here now.

210
00:09:41,147 --> 00:09:43,946
The first lesson that
I'm gonna teach you,

211
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:47,518
right, is about
finding success.

212
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,217
And the key to
finding success is
to picture a winner.

213
00:10:03,136 --> 00:10:07,267
Okay, so then,
what are you
picturing right now,

214
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:08,831
right this second?

215
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,936
'Cause the universe
is yours, people.

216
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:15,038
Get out of the way.

217
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,217
I'm really excited
to introduce you guys
to Ryan Howard.

218
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,589
He has achieved a
great deal in the last...

219
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,492
But perhaps no
achievement is greater

220
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:32,088
than his on-again,
off-again girlfriend.

221
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:33,360
What are you...

222
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:34,792
Who am I?

223
00:10:34,868 --> 00:10:37,895
I'm Kelly Kapoor,
the business bitch.

224
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,599
It is important
to brand yourself,

225
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:41,436
so I have a couple
of things in the works.

226
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,568
The business bitch,
the diet bitch,

227
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,839
the shopping bitch,
the etiquette bitch.

228
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,414
I could sit here,
and I could tell you the
10 secrets of business,

229
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,780
and you would
have a great time,

230
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,580
and you would
learn a lot.

231
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,711
But who better
to tell you

232
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,352
than the Yale University
adjunct professor
in management,

233
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:02,293
Professor Scott Powell,
who I have on my BlackBerry.

234
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,129


235
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,964
MAN: <i>Hey, Kelly Kapoor.</i>

236
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:11,027
<i>What a delicious surprise.</i>

237
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:14,700


238
00:11:16,109 --> 00:11:17,338
<i>Uh, why?</i>

239
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,902
Do you think you
could tell us the 10
secrets of business?

240
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,815
<i>Um, there aren't</i>
<i>really 10 secrets.</i>

241
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,851
Come on, Scott,
please. It's me.

242
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,481
<i>Uh, all right. Well,</i>

243
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:31,718
<i>Uh,</i>
<i>I guess know your</i>
<i>market would be key.</i>

244
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,886
<i>Practice fiscal discipline.</i>

245
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,357
That brilliant little bitch.

246
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:41,258
A little treat for
our old friend, Gabe.

247
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,235
Put that "Q"
right there.

248
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,894
Wait. Why?

249
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,064
Put the "Q"
there, sweetie.

250
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,135
I think
there's better...
Put the "Q" there!

251
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,107
Sorry I yelled.

252
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:56,672
You could have
just told us what
you were thinking.

253
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,877
There's no theater
in that.

254
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:01,114
There's no yelling
in that, either.
Well...

255
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,721
What do you do
in your free time?

256
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:04,451
Practice Olympics.

257
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,386
Do you like movies?

258
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,987
I like the
musical <i>Grease,</i>

259
00:12:10,196 --> 00:12:12,165
or as we call
it, "home."

260
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:16,501
We have to try this
out on somebody.

261
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,531
Hello.

262
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:20,831
Look, you want
to order something?

263
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,900
She will have
a greekaccino.

264
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:26,108
I don't know
what that is.

265
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,673
It...

266
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:32,151
It's a very strong
coffee with milk
from a goat.

267
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,816
I can't
believe it.

268
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,186
It's a miracle.
She can talk.

269
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,182
No more brain damage.

270
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,092
No more brain damage!

271
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,099
I don't know.

272
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:51,529
Ladies and gentlemen,
our special guest
speaker will provoke you.

273
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,505
He will inspire you.

274
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:55,773
He is...

275
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,072
Creed Bratton.

276
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:03,515
Two eyes, two ears,

277
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,518
a chin, a mouth,

278
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,755
ten fingers,
two nipples,

279
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,950
a butt, two kneecaps,
a penis.

280
00:13:12,925 --> 00:13:16,259
I have just
described to you the
Loch Ness monster.

281
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,866
And the reward
for its capture?

282
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:22,697
All the riches
in Scotland.

283
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,103
So I have one question,
why are you here?

284
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:32,770
Okay! All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

285
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:36,338
it is now time for
the rarest of things,

286
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,509
an actual free lunch.

287
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,575
There's sandwiches
in the back.
Certainly help yourselves.

288
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,018
We'll meet back
up in an hour.

289
00:13:41,087 --> 00:13:43,420
I picked out our movie.
It's called <i>Suspiria.</i>

290
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:44,821
It pushes all
the boundaries.

291
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,986
All your preconceived
notions about what horror
can be, come crashing down.

292
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,529
When I win,

293
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,495
we're gonna
watch <i>Wall-E,</i>

294
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,191
where all the boundaries
of color are pushed.

295
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,363
GABE: <i>It is hard to</i>
<i>explain why Erin is</i>
<i>doing so well today.</i>

296
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,067
The only thing I can
think is Erin is living out

297
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,110
some <i>Slumdog Millionaire</i>
scenario,

298
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:08,308
where every word she's
playing has a connection
to her orphan past.

299
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,113
It's possible.

300
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,288
So what's your crazy
business pipe dream?

301
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:20,584
Well, I started my own
golf supply company.

302
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:23,528
Really?
It's taken off faster
than I expected,

303
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:26,395
so I came here
to learn about creating
manageable growth.

304
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,032
Phyllis?

305
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:33,939
Some of these
people are for real.

306
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:37,877
Hey, friend.
How's it going?

307
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,775
Oh, you know what?
Let me steep
that for you.

308
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,982
Thank you.
Hey, you
know what?

309
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,984
Good news.
We're back in.

310
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:48,283
Let's go sell some
paper, buddy. Huh?

311
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:49,515
Really?

312
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,956
Excuse me.
I got it. I got it.

313
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,121
Hey, do you
need a lozenge?

314
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:58,625
They're a bunch
of jackals.

315
00:14:58,698 --> 00:14:59,722
What?

316
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,927
They left you
in the lurch,

317
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,597
and if they want
to jump in, it means
you're almost there.

318
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:06,764
You did this.

319
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:09,100
Bring it home.

320
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,885
Let me tell you what
you can do with
your offer to help.

321
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,012
You can table it
and offer it up
another time.

322
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,023
Just know that
I really appreciate
the gesture.

323
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:27,790
Hi. Hope you
enjoyed your lunch.

324
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,328
Welcome back.

325
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:32,727
Ooh, well, hello.

326
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:35,334
Welcome to the seminar.

327
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:36,960
Hey, man.
What's going on?

328
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,060


329
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:41,397
Maybe.
Only maybe.

330
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:46,268
We got it.

331
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:47,472
Wow, we got it.

332
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:52,750
Oscar, wait. I think
the victory would
be more meaningful

333
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:55,288
if Erin puts the
last word in herself.

334
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,554
Yes, Pam.
Yes, most definitely.

335
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,752
Yes.
Yes.

336
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:02,227
No.

337
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:09,460
Although I must say,
I will have apoplexy
if you lose.

338
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:13,464
Do you understand?
Apoplexy is what
I will have.

339
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,965
Apoplexy.
Yes.

340
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,771
Got it.

341
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:23,115
Oh, Oscar.

342
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:24,410
Oscar?

343
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:27,143
I played "ape."

344
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:32,988
I just want to make
a point to that last
caller. I disagree.

345
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,618
I don't think it is the
running game at all.

346
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,493
I think we do have
to make a few moves
in this off-season.

347
00:16:37,563 --> 00:16:38,690
Wow!

348
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:40,858
What a day, right?

349
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,868
Guess you guys are
probably ready to go.

350
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,099
And you got my
business card, so...

351
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,437
You know,
I like you.

352
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,376
I'm going to give you
my secret gyro recipe.

353
00:16:51,444 --> 00:16:54,539
Come out here,
since it's a secret,
and I'll tell you.

354
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,279
All right, you have
to close right now.

355
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,751
Yeah, I'm getting to it.

356
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:00,946
No, you're not.
You're getting past it.

357
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,352
You have to close.
Do it. You can do it.

358
00:17:02,421 --> 00:17:03,445
Yeah, yeah.

359
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,821
Andy, what's
the problem?

360
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,987
This is hard
for me. I'm a nice guy.

361
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,553
You know, Kelly
and Creed, Kevin,

362
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,196
they believe in you.

363
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,022
Don't let them down.

364
00:17:13,432 --> 00:17:15,867
Don't let yourself
down, Andy.

365
00:17:15,935 --> 00:17:19,394
I'm gonna go back in.
I'm going to stall
them for a little bit.

366
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:21,805
I want you to get
your head together,
and then come back in.

367
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,240
I want you to close.

368
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,408
MICHAEL: What is taking that
guy so long?

369
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:30,142
Psst!

370
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,050
You think
this thing's gonna
go much longer?

371
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:38,950
I don't know.
They're still in there.

372
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:41,051
Goodbye.
Stop.

373
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:43,385
Out with it.

374
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:45,030
Here's the story.

375
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:49,193


376
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,600
Tom Witashkin.

377
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,161
One of my best
buddies, actually.

378
00:17:52,238 --> 00:17:54,230
And when they
were both in
the third grade,

379
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,242
Jim was placed in the
top reading group.

380
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,369
JIM: <i>I was blue group,</i>
<i>so I was second from the top.</i>

381
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:00,845
<i>PAM: And Tom...</i>
<i>Was in green group.</i>

382
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,541
And Jim's
mom suggested

383
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:06,643
that Jim spend time
hanging with the kids
in his reading group,

384
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,779
because she thought
that they would be
a good influence.

385
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:11,323
And that's what
I told him.
Right.

386
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:13,922
But how'd
you say it?

387
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:18,088
"My mom thinks
you're too dumb
to hang out with."

388
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,257
Okay, who would
like to purchase

389
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,327
this small business
package from me right now?

390
00:18:26,138 --> 00:18:27,731
Yes, we got one.

391
00:18:28,174 --> 00:18:30,837
Okay, the snowball is rolling.

392
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,173
Who else?

393
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,106
You can put it off
for a couple of days,

394
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:38,344
but I guarantee you,

395
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:42,081
eventually you're gonna
realize you need this.

396
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,853
So the only thing that's
gonna be different

397
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,019
is you'll be a couple
of days behind

398
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:51,622
where you would be
if you bought this
from me right now.

399
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,425
So who's gonna
buy one right now?

400
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,695
I'll take one.
Yes! Awesome!

401
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,672
All right, anyone else?

402
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,907
Sold! Anybody else?

403
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,606
Yes! All right!

404
00:19:08,014 --> 00:19:09,744
Yeah, bitch.
ANDY: Good choice.

405
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:12,111
The rest of you
are dead to me.

406
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,050
You made the stupidest
decisions of your life.

407
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,748
No, no, no.

408
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:17,153
But it was a pleasure
meeting you,

409
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,125
and you've got my information,
so feel free to call anytime.

410
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:27,222
Hey, you think it's coo I
if I grab a soda?
Yeah.

411
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:28,927
Yep, absolutely,
go ahead.

412
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,159
Hey.

413
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:33,230
Hey.
Hey.

414
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,001
How's it going?
Pretty good. Good.

415
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,566
It's been a while.
It has been, yeah.

416
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,244
So you work here, huh?

417
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:40,335
Sales.

418
00:19:40,446 --> 00:19:43,382
Must be a front
for some kind of
famous laboratory.

419
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,151
'Cause you're so smart.

420
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:48,914
Oh, man. You remember
that, huh?

421
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,115
Barely. I'm so dumb,

422
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,858
you know,
stuff goes in,
stuff goes out.

423
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,724
Not like you probably
remember every paper
sale you ever made.

424
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,696
Paper salesman genius.

425
00:20:00,733 --> 00:20:01,757
All right, good catch-up.

426
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:03,302
Yeah.
See you.

427
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,235
Where's your jetpack,
Zuckerberg?

428
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,633
Andy.

429
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,134
I didn't think
you had it in you.

430
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,907
Well, I guess when
you looked in me,

431
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,472
you forgot about my balls.
They're on the outside.

432
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,947
Don't know how
you missed 'em.

433
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,549
Wonderful seminar!

434
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:23,782
Almost as good

435
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,651
<i>as the day when</i>
<i>we first met.</i>

436
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:29,525
You are the
love of my life.

437
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:32,325
Come to me, Necropolis.

438
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:35,891
Put your lips on
my lips. Come on.

439
00:20:37,002 --> 00:20:38,732
Michael, I should
get back to work.

440
00:20:38,804 --> 00:20:42,104
What? Come on.
It's time for grapes.

441
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,712
That was a fun day.

442
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,379
So, I won.

443
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:53,476
I know.
You get to pick.

444
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,953
Well, that's actually
what I came to talk
to you about.

445
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:57,819
I know how much you
want to watch <i>Wall-E.</i>

446
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,951
Yes?
So I got us
a compromise.

447
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,585
This movie is
called <i>Hardware,</i>

448
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:06,223
it tells the story of
a killer combat robot,
just like Wall-E,

449
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:08,824
that the government
invented to
destroy humans.

450
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:12,338
It's some of what
you like and some
of what I like. And...

451
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:16,307
Erin, I heard you talking
about movies before and...

452
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:17,809
Anyway, I just watched
this over the weekend.

453
00:21:17,877 --> 00:21:19,311
I thought you'd
really like it.

454
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:20,676
There's a <i>Shrek 2?</i>

455
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,009
Oh, yeah.

456
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,140
See you tomorrow.

457
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:25,343
Nice guy.

458
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,444
Ooh.
