1
00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:04,936
David.

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:06,990
Oh, Michael.

3
00:00:06,992 --> 00:00:08,491
Are we all set?

4
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:11,861
Isn't...
our interview tomorrow?

5
00:00:13,964 --> 00:00:15,098
Yes.

6
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,200
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood,

7
00:00:17,202 --> 00:00:19,102
thought I'd drop in, say hello.

8
00:00:19,104 --> 00:00:20,603
Just happened to be
in Midtown Manhattan?

9
00:00:20,605 --> 00:00:23,440
Thought I'd catch a show.

10
00:00:23,442 --> 00:00:25,041
Middle of a work day?

11
00:00:25,043 --> 00:00:26,810
No.

12
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,878
You know what?

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,281
Since I'm here,
let me ask you a few questions

14
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,316
about the job.

15
00:00:33,318 --> 00:00:34,617
Okay.

16
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,319
Um, how many people
are you interviewing?

17
00:00:36,321 --> 00:00:38,221
We're only interviewing
branch managers

18
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:39,989
and some lower level
company people.

19
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:42,125
Ah, well. Good.

20
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:43,893
Out of curiosity,
are you interviewing anyone

21
00:00:43,895 --> 00:00:45,728
who's been here
longer than I have,

22
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:47,564
or manages more people?

23
00:00:47,566 --> 00:00:49,499
- I don't think so.
- Great.

24
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:51,267
One more question.

25
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:54,304
When you merged those branches,
who did you put in charge?

26
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:57,073
I believe we put you in charge.

27
00:00:57,075 --> 00:00:58,975
Ah, great.
No further questions.

28
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:00,477
- Okay, Michael.
- Okay.

29
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:02,245
I'm really looking forward
to our interview.

30
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,614
And I'm really looking forward
to working with you.

31
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:12,088
I have got it made in the shade.

32
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,289
I know this company.

33
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,825
The other branch managers
are total morons.

34
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:16,993
Hey, Pam, yeah.

35
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,094
I forgot what day
the interview was,

36
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:19,362
and I drove
to New York accidentally.

37
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:21,297
Be, like, three hours late.

38
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:45,188
See, I have 600.

39
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:46,856
Yeah, I don't have...

40
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,458
Hey.

41
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,592
Hey, Kev.

42
00:01:49,594 --> 00:01:52,262
What's different about you?

43
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:53,496
You look worse.

44
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:54,497
Thank you.

45
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:55,498
He got a haircut.

46
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
That's sexy.
Hot.

47
00:01:57,002 --> 00:01:58,034
Oh.

48
00:01:58,036 --> 00:01:59,169
Turn around.

49
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,170
- No.
- C'mon.

50
00:02:00,172 --> 00:02:00,904
No, thanks.

51
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,572
Do it!

52
00:02:02,574 --> 00:02:03,940
Lull-up do!

53
00:02:03,942 --> 00:02:06,342
What's up, Big Haircut?

54
00:02:06,344 --> 00:02:08,077
You are no longer Big Tuna.

55
00:02:08,079 --> 00:02:10,547
From henceforth, you shall
be known as Big Haircut.

56
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:11,548
Andy, just...

57
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,183
- Big Haircut?
- Nothing.

58
00:02:13,185 --> 00:02:14,384
Sorry, can't hear you,
Big Haircut.

59
00:02:14,386 --> 00:02:15,418
- Yup.
- What.

60
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,221
Karen suggested
that I get a haircut

61
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,523
for the interview tomorrow.

62
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:22,525
So that I could look
presentable.

63
00:02:22,527 --> 00:02:25,695
And not, as she
so lovingly puts it,

64
00:02:25,697 --> 00:02:27,497
homeless.

65
00:02:27,499 --> 00:02:28,831
Hey.

66
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:30,166
I think it looks great.

67
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:32,268
Thanks, Pam.

68
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:38,141
After I had my little outburst
at the beach,

69
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:40,143
Jim was really nice about it.

70
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:41,177
He just basically said

71
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:43,813
that he missed
my friendship too,

72
00:02:43,815 --> 00:02:45,448
and I would always mean
a lot to him.

73
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:47,483
And I understand
where he's coming from.

74
00:02:47,485 --> 00:02:50,753
For the record,
I am not embarrassed at all.

75
00:02:50,755 --> 00:02:53,056
It needed to be said,
and I said it.

76
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,491
And it only took me three years

77
00:02:55,493 --> 00:02:57,660
to summon the courage, so...

78
00:02:57,662 --> 00:02:59,796
Thank you.

79
00:02:59,798 --> 00:03:01,531
Yeah?

80
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,732
You wanted to see me?

81
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,300
Yes.

82
00:03:04,302 --> 00:03:06,502
The time has come
to name my own replacement.

83
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:09,973
So please hand this letter
of congratulations

84
00:03:09,975 --> 00:03:12,875
to Dwight K. Schrute.

85
00:03:14,612 --> 00:03:17,347
But that's my name.

86
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:25,321
"Dwight, congratulations,
a-wipe.

87
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:28,091
Don't screw the pooch."

88
00:03:32,497 --> 00:03:34,397
Oh.

89
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:35,565
Thank you.

90
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,700
Okay.

91
00:03:40,338 --> 00:03:41,337
All right.

92
00:03:41,339 --> 00:03:42,338
Thank you, Michael.

93
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,407
Okay.

94
00:03:47,711 --> 00:03:49,579
- Thank you so much.
- Please.

95
00:03:50,582 --> 00:03:51,581
Stop crying.

96
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,915
Thank you.

97
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:02,425
Hey.

98
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,160
Hey.

99
00:04:04,162 --> 00:04:07,497
Um, about the beach.

100
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:09,999
It's okay, we all say things
without thinking.

101
00:04:10,001 --> 00:04:11,601
Oh, no, it's not that.

102
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,870
I've actually been thinking that
for a long time.

103
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:15,471
And I'm glad I said it.

104
00:04:15,473 --> 00:04:18,241
I just, I'm sorry
if it made you feel weird.

105
00:04:18,243 --> 00:04:21,444
Oh.

106
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:22,979
Okay.

107
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:27,250
Pam is kind of a bitch.

108
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:28,685
Hey.

109
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:30,386
What if we leave tonight?

110
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:32,689
Grab a bite, get a hotel room.

111
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:34,524
Enjoy the city a little bit.

112
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,060
Uh...

113
00:04:37,062 --> 00:04:39,762
I just have
so much paperwork to do.

114
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,467
Wow, done.

115
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:47,103
Okay, let's do it.

116
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:48,805
So I was wondering if Karen
and I could get off

117
00:04:48,807 --> 00:04:50,173
a few hours early,
'cause we wanted

118
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:51,174
to spend the night in the city.

119
00:04:51,176 --> 00:04:53,309
Why, so you can do it?

120
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,344
Whoops.

121
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:55,445
No, um...

122
00:04:55,447 --> 00:04:56,779
Well, I was thinking that, uh,

123
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,715
actually, we could
all leave tomorrow.

124
00:04:58,717 --> 00:05:00,383
And do a convoy.

125
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:01,718
- You know?
- Oh.

126
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,853
Convoys are really fun.

127
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,355
Pull up next to each other.

128
00:05:05,357 --> 00:05:06,956
Give each other the finger.

129
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,057
Mm.

130
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:09,659
Moon each other.

131
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:11,027
Uh, we're gonna go tonight.

132
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:12,395
But we're gonna see you there
tomorrow morning, right?

133
00:05:12,397 --> 00:05:13,463
All right.
All right.

134
00:05:13,465 --> 00:05:14,864
Your loss.
Wait.

135
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:16,799
Um, how would you moon us
if you were driving?

136
00:05:16,801 --> 00:05:17,934
Cruise control.

137
00:05:17,936 --> 00:05:19,335
Oh.

138
00:05:19,337 --> 00:05:22,305
So Jim, who do you think
is hotter,

139
00:05:22,307 --> 00:05:24,107
Pam or Karen?

140
00:05:24,109 --> 00:05:26,008
Yeah, I'm not gonna talk
about this now.

141
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,110
Pam is taller.

142
00:05:27,112 --> 00:05:28,144
You sure?

143
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:30,680
Yes.

144
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,815
She has bigger breasts too.

145
00:05:32,817 --> 00:05:33,950
Wow.

146
00:05:33,952 --> 00:05:35,585
But I think Karen
has a prettier face.

147
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:37,253
Mm-hmm.

148
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,088
Mm-hmm.

149
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,023
What else?

150
00:05:41,025 --> 00:05:44,761
Well, I mean, Pam's face
is really pretty too.

151
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:46,195
It's a very tough call.

152
00:05:46,197 --> 00:05:47,630
Mm.

153
00:05:47,632 --> 00:05:48,698
Really tough call.

154
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,866
Yeah.

155
00:05:49,868 --> 00:05:51,634
You know what,
why don't you take

156
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,369
the rest of the day,
figure it out,

157
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:55,938
and then come back
and tell me what you got?

158
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,408
Will do.

159
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,176
All right.

160
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:02,879
Yes.

161
00:06:02,881 --> 00:06:05,014
Hey, Pam.

162
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:06,949
I've been meaning
to say something to you.

163
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,851
I really miss our friendship.

164
00:06:10,054 --> 00:06:11,921
Ha ha, that's very funny.

165
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,956
I've never heard you
talk that much.

166
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,425
I thought it was Kelly.

167
00:06:15,427 --> 00:06:17,326
Are you kidding?
I would never have done that.

168
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:18,361
It was patheticville.

169
00:06:18,363 --> 00:06:19,362
No offense, Pam.

170
00:06:19,364 --> 00:06:20,363
You know what?

171
00:06:20,365 --> 00:06:21,798
Don't even worry about it.

172
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,832
Everyone was so drunk,

173
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:24,634
I bet no one even remembers
what you said.

174
00:06:24,636 --> 00:06:25,635
I remember.

175
00:06:25,637 --> 00:06:27,170
I blogged the whole thing.

176
00:06:27,172 --> 00:06:33,609
www.creedthoughts.gov.
www\creedthoughts.

177
00:06:33,611 --> 00:06:34,977
Check it out.

178
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,014
Last year, Creed asked me
how to set up a blog.

179
00:06:38,016 --> 00:06:42,452
Wanting to protect the world
from being exposed

180
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:45,755
to Creed's brain,
I opened up a Word document

181
00:06:45,757 --> 00:06:48,825
on his computer,
and put an address at the top.

182
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:51,127
I've read some of it.

183
00:06:51,129 --> 00:06:52,528
Even for the internet,

184
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:56,165
it's...
pretty shocking.

185
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,200
There they are.

186
00:06:57,202 --> 00:06:58,367
The accounting department.

187
00:06:58,369 --> 00:07:00,369
I shall miss your humility

188
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:02,338
and your
promptly-printed checks.

189
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,673
Do you think
it's gonna be weird?

190
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:05,908
Working with Jan in New York?

191
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,009
No, not at all.

192
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,878
I haven't talked to Jan
since we broke up.

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,581
And I think if she had
something to say,

194
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:12,748
she would've called me.

195
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,150
Maybe you should talk to her...

196
00:07:14,152 --> 00:07:15,151
No, no, no, no.

197
00:07:15,153 --> 00:07:16,152
You know what?

198
00:07:16,154 --> 00:07:17,420
It's a done deal.

199
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:19,222
I basically have the job
already.

200
00:07:19,224 --> 00:07:21,324
There's nothing she can do
to stop it now.

201
00:07:21,326 --> 00:07:22,558
I already sold my condo.

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,659
Michael.

203
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:24,927
What?
Why?

204
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:26,596
I'm sorry,
that just doesn't make sense.

205
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:27,597
Yes.
W-why?

206
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,898
Who gave you that advice?

207
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,033
Yeah, Michael, you should never
sell your condo...

208
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,301
I have to buy another place.

209
00:07:32,303 --> 00:07:33,503
But you said you were in debt.

210
00:07:33,505 --> 00:07:35,037
You're not sure
that you have the job.

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,106
I sold it on eBay.

212
00:07:37,108 --> 00:07:39,876
The buyer was very motivated,
as was I.

213
00:07:39,878 --> 00:07:42,578
It went for 80% of what I paid.

214
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,881
Sold in record time.

215
00:07:44,883 --> 00:07:46,315
How would you like to spend
the night

216
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,719
with the regional manager
of Dunder-Mifflin Scranton?

217
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:52,188
No, Dwight, I don't care
if that's how

218
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,290
they consolidated power
in ancient Rome.

219
00:07:54,292 --> 00:07:56,158
No, no.
Not... not Michael.

220
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,960
Me.

221
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:00,897
I'm taking his job.

222
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:03,099
Not now.

223
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:12,108
Good-bye, Kelly Kapur.

224
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,578
Jim, Jim, Jim.

225
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:21,717
Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim,
Jim, Jim, Jim.

226
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,153
Oh.
Hey, Dwight.

227
00:08:24,155 --> 00:08:26,022
I'm going to be your new boss.

228
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:29,692
It's my greatest dream
come true.

229
00:08:29,694 --> 00:08:31,427
Welcome to the Hotel Hell.

230
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,830
Check-in time is now,
check-out time is never.

231
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:36,098
Does my room have cable?

232
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,099
No.

233
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,368
And the sheets are made of fire.

234
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,836
Can I change rooms?

235
00:08:40,838 --> 00:08:42,438
Sorry, we're all booked up.

236
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,607
Hell convention in town.

237
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:46,142
Can I have a late checkout?

238
00:08:46,144 --> 00:08:47,843
We'll have to talk
to the manager.

239
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,412
You're not the manager?

240
00:08:49,414 --> 00:08:51,013
Even in your own fantasy?

241
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:53,783
I'm the owner.

242
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,318
The co-owner.

243
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,886
With Satan.

244
00:08:56,888 --> 00:08:59,655
Okay, just so I understand it.

245
00:08:59,657 --> 00:09:03,359
In your wildest fantasy,
you are in hell.

246
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:06,662
And you are co-running
a bed and breakfast

247
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:07,897
with the devil.

248
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,433
Yeah, but I haven't told you
my salary yet.

249
00:09:10,435 --> 00:09:11,434
Go.

250
00:09:11,436 --> 00:09:15,071
$80,000 a year.

251
00:09:15,073 --> 00:09:16,639
Once I am officially
regional manager,

252
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,976
my first order of business
will be to demote Jim Halpert.

253
00:09:19,978 --> 00:09:22,578
So I will need a new number two.

254
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,214
My ideal choice?

255
00:09:25,216 --> 00:09:27,116
Jack Bauer.

256
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:29,251
But he is unavailable.

257
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,953
Fictional.

258
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,855
And overqualified.

259
00:09:32,857 --> 00:09:36,525
I will see you...

260
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:39,495
at the interview.

261
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,798
Yes, you will.

262
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,634
Who is D. Abramson?

263
00:09:44,636 --> 00:09:46,168
Um, he's from that company
in Pittsburgh.

264
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,169
Michael.

265
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:49,538
Why?

266
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,540
Are you here?

267
00:09:51,542 --> 00:09:55,645
Uh, how are you?

268
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:56,646
I'm good.

269
00:09:56,648 --> 00:09:57,780
How are you, Janet?

270
00:09:57,782 --> 00:09:58,781
It's good to see you.

271
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,349
I'm great.

272
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:07,890
Uh, can we...
can we talk privately

273
00:10:07,892 --> 00:10:09,291
for a minute?

274
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:11,193
Why privately?

275
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:15,631
Uh, I just...
I, uh, I don't, uh.

276
00:10:15,633 --> 00:10:17,900
I-I don't like the way
that we left things.

277
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,036
Okay, sure.
Fine.

278
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:21,470
Um, why don't you wait
in my office?

279
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:23,305
I have some important
business matters

280
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,008
to take care of.

281
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:27,276
Okay.

282
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:29,245
Okay.

283
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:35,718
Pam, DEFCON 10,
Houston, we have a problem.

284
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,753
What do you want me to do?

285
00:10:37,755 --> 00:10:40,423
Uh, I may need
some immediate assistance.

286
00:10:40,425 --> 00:10:43,659
If you would slowly and quietly
gather the ladies

287
00:10:43,661 --> 00:10:44,760
in the conference room.

288
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:45,995
Phyllis, Angela, Karen.

289
00:10:45,997 --> 00:10:47,329
What about Meredith?

290
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:48,798
No.

291
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,833
She's an alternate.

292
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:52,435
So how you been?

293
00:10:52,437 --> 00:10:53,669
- I've been good.
- Good.

294
00:10:53,671 --> 00:10:55,371
Good. Yeah.

295
00:10:55,373 --> 00:10:56,439
Oh.

296
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:57,773
Sorry to drop by unexpectedly.

297
00:10:57,775 --> 00:11:01,143
I, uh, tried calling,
but I kept getting voice-mail.

298
00:11:01,145 --> 00:11:02,678
Weird, yeah.

299
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,580
I didn't get
both of your messages.

300
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:06,582
Ah.

301
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:11,420
So, uh, Michael needs us
in the conference room.

302
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,421
Oh, is it Jan again?

303
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:15,124
Hey, uh, before I leave tonight,

304
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:17,393
would you mind making
a half a dozen copies

305
00:11:17,395 --> 00:11:18,561
of Jim's and my sales reports

306
00:11:18,563 --> 00:11:19,562
for our interviews tomorrow?

307
00:11:19,564 --> 00:11:20,563
Uh, sure.

308
00:11:20,565 --> 00:11:21,931
Thanks.

309
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:24,133
I really hope you get the job.

310
00:11:24,135 --> 00:11:28,571
Thanks.

311
00:11:28,573 --> 00:11:31,307
After you ended everything
with us,

312
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:32,808
I went on a vacation.

313
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,443
Mm.

314
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:35,644
To kind of clear my mind.

315
00:11:35,646 --> 00:11:37,113
Sounds good, sounds fun.

316
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:39,849
It was, yeah, it was good.

317
00:11:39,851 --> 00:11:41,917
I think I should just...

318
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:43,652
get right to the point,
you know?

319
00:11:43,654 --> 00:11:47,790
Um, I-I feel good
about myself

320
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:51,360
for the first time
in a really long time.

321
00:11:51,362 --> 00:11:53,629
And I've made some big changes

322
00:11:53,631 --> 00:11:56,432
in my life, and...

323
00:11:56,434 --> 00:11:58,868
I miss you.

324
00:12:00,937 --> 00:12:02,972
I want us to get back together.

325
00:12:07,043 --> 00:12:09,078
Would you excuse me
for a second?

326
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,647
Oh, okay.

327
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:15,584
DEFCON 20.

328
00:12:15,586 --> 00:12:16,719
She wants to get back together.

329
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:17,887
What are you gonna do?

330
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:19,588
I don't know.
That's why you're here.

331
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,790
Help me, please.

332
00:12:20,792 --> 00:12:21,824
Would you wanna get
back together with her?

333
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:23,425
No! No.

334
00:12:23,427 --> 00:12:24,660
What do I do?

335
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:26,562
Just don't get
back together with her.

336
00:12:26,564 --> 00:12:27,696
What if she makes me?

337
00:12:27,698 --> 00:12:29,465
How can she make you
get back together with her?

338
00:12:29,467 --> 00:12:32,134
She made me do a lot of things
I didn't wanna do.

339
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:34,436
This was
a terrible relationship.

340
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,138
You were not happy
when you were with her.

341
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,139
I wasn't.

342
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:38,841
You're so much happier now.

343
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:41,110
Just go in there and be strong.

344
00:12:41,112 --> 00:12:42,645
You're right.

345
00:12:42,647 --> 00:12:44,280
You are absolutely right,
I need to go in there

346
00:12:44,282 --> 00:12:46,282
and tell her
that we can't be together.

347
00:12:46,284 --> 00:12:47,817
Right.

348
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,451
- Wow.
- You can do it.

349
00:12:49,453 --> 00:12:51,787
I'm in a very good place
right now.

350
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:52,788
Thank you.

351
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,490
Go. Go, go.

352
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:57,426
Okay.

353
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:01,297
Jan...

354
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,666
We need to talk.

355
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,173
Jan is in a different place
right now.

356
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,275
And it is a sign of maturity

357
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:16,078
to give people second chances.

358
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,980
So I'm going to hear her out.

359
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:26,155
Oh, my God.

360
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:30,759
Yeah, bigger actually.

361
00:13:30,761 --> 00:13:31,760
That's crazy.

362
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:32,895
Mm-hmm.

363
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:39,201
Oh, my God,
can you believe that?

364
00:13:39,203 --> 00:13:40,402
Unbelievable.

365
00:13:40,404 --> 00:13:41,737
Wow.

366
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:42,972
She could put the cup
right there.

367
00:13:42,974 --> 00:13:43,973
I know.

368
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,474
No, it's fine.

369
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:47,509
I'm sure it must've been weird
for Jim

370
00:13:47,511 --> 00:13:50,312
when Roy and I
were joking around.

371
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:52,181
That one time.

372
00:13:53,984 --> 00:13:55,517
I would never do that.

373
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,653
Waste of money.

374
00:13:57,655 --> 00:14:00,522
In my experience,
guys are way more attracted

375
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:03,025
to the back of you
than to the front.

376
00:14:03,027 --> 00:14:04,760
I love fake boobs.

377
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:07,830
Oftentimes you find them
on strippers.

378
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:08,831
I find it offensive.

379
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,532
Au naturel, baby.

380
00:14:10,534 --> 00:14:11,834
That's how I like 'em.

381
00:14:11,836 --> 00:14:14,870
Swing low, sweet chariots.

382
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,438
So...

383
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,240
There are a lot of things
I would like to do differently.

384
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:19,241
Yeah.

385
00:14:19,243 --> 00:14:21,243
I feel like
when we first got together,

386
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:23,212
that I had a problem
with my priorities.

387
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:24,713
First got priorities.

388
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:27,449
And if we could talk
about a way to approach

389
00:14:27,451 --> 00:14:28,851
a possible reconciliation.

390
00:14:28,853 --> 00:14:30,352
Let's get back together.

391
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,089
No. No, no, no.

392
00:14:34,091 --> 00:14:35,157
I'll tell you this,

393
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:37,092
it is not
because of the boob job.

394
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:39,228
Excuse me, boob enhancement.

395
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,429
That would be shallow.

396
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,464
And this is the opposite
of shallow.

397
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:46,001
This is emotionally magnificent.

398
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:47,436
Okay, everyone, listen up!

399
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:50,572
Time to begin
the interview process!

400
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,310
Andrew Bernard.

401
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:56,211
Saving the best for first.

402
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:57,980
All right, you guys,
see you later.

403
00:14:57,982 --> 00:14:59,181
Wish us luck.

404
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:00,616
No! Hey, hey, hey,
do not wish them luck.

405
00:15:00,618 --> 00:15:01,784
Do not wish them luck.

406
00:15:01,786 --> 00:15:03,585
All luck must be wished
unto Michael.

407
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:05,421
Good luck, you guys.

408
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,889
What did I say?

409
00:15:06,891 --> 00:15:07,890
Good luck.

410
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:09,625
Thanks.

411
00:15:12,796 --> 00:15:14,430
I'm happy for him.

412
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:16,098
I hope he gets the job.

413
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,233
I really just want him
to be happy.

414
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:19,902
And I know that sounds cliché.

415
00:15:19,904 --> 00:15:24,740
And I know saying
it sounds cliché sounds cliché.

416
00:15:24,742 --> 00:15:27,209
Maybe I'm being cliché,
I don't care.

417
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:30,980
'Cause I am what I am.

418
00:15:30,982 --> 00:15:33,315
That's Popeye.

419
00:15:33,317 --> 00:15:35,084
I am going to begin this process

420
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:36,919
with a simple test
of intelligence

421
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,722
and mental dexterity.

422
00:15:39,724 --> 00:15:41,023
What is the best color?

423
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:44,827
White, because it contains
all other colors.

424
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:46,929
Wrong, black.
It is the most dominant.

425
00:15:46,931 --> 00:15:48,230
How do you make a table?

426
00:15:48,232 --> 00:15:51,600
You make a chair,
but you don't sit on it.

427
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:52,901
What is the capital of Maine?

428
00:15:52,903 --> 00:15:55,604
The capital of Maine
is Montpelier, Vermont.

429
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,740
Which is near Ithaca, New York,

430
00:15:57,742 --> 00:15:59,141
where I went to Cornell.

431
00:15:59,143 --> 00:16:02,111
Okay, also, moratorium
on Cornell talk.

432
00:16:02,113 --> 00:16:03,245
Don't wanna hear about it.

433
00:16:03,247 --> 00:16:04,546
Forget your personal history,

434
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,148
and learn the history
of this company.

435
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,149
Should not be a problem.

436
00:16:07,151 --> 00:16:08,283
I minored in history

437
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:10,219
in the ivy league school
which I attended.

438
00:16:10,221 --> 00:16:12,488
You're not off
to a very good start, Bernard.

439
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:14,390
I agree.

440
00:16:14,392 --> 00:16:16,759
But in another way,

441
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:20,295
I am off to a very good start,
wouldn't you say?

442
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:22,831
I am a great interviewee.

443
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,834
Why? Because I have something
no one else has.

444
00:16:25,836 --> 00:16:28,003
My brain.

445
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:32,608
Which I use to my advantage,
when advantageous.

446
00:16:36,013 --> 00:16:37,846
Time!
Nope, you failed.

447
00:16:37,848 --> 00:16:39,148
Damn it!

448
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:43,252
This interview is over,
I'll let you know.

449
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:45,821
Hey, thank you so much
for driving me down

450
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,822
for my interview.

451
00:16:46,824 --> 00:16:48,090
Totally. No problem.

452
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:50,192
What are you interviewing for,
by the way?

453
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:51,660
My assistant, or...

454
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:53,028
Oh, you know, I'm gonna have

455
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,664
a "Congratulations, Karen"
party, um,

456
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,099
tomorrow night
at my friend's house.

457
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:59,168
- Oh, wow, that sounds fun.
- Yeah.

458
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:01,203
Is your friend named Karen too?

459
00:17:01,205 --> 00:17:02,604
What did she accomplish?

460
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,807
No, I'm sorry.
I should've been clearer.

461
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:06,041
Uh-huh.
It's for me.

462
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:09,878
- Oh.
- 'Cause I'm gonna get the job.

463
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,647
How remarkable.

464
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:13,449
Thanks.

465
00:17:15,686 --> 00:17:17,953
Wait, let me just
check one more thing.

466
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,190
Okay.

467
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,058
Very good.

468
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:30,833
All right, well,
I have to get back.

469
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:32,901
But I will see you
in New York tomorrow, right?

470
00:17:32,903 --> 00:17:33,902
Yes, indeed.

471
00:17:33,904 --> 00:17:35,070
Good luck with your interview.

472
00:17:35,072 --> 00:17:37,573
Thank you.

473
00:17:37,575 --> 00:17:39,041
Bye.

474
00:17:45,048 --> 00:17:46,648
So I...

475
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,283
guess we're getting
back together.

476
00:17:48,285 --> 00:17:49,518
What happened?

477
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,253
Your advice was good,

478
00:17:51,255 --> 00:17:53,655
but Jan's was bigger.

479
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:55,324
Here's the sitch.

480
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:58,760
Two weeks ago, I was
in the worst relationship

481
00:17:58,762 --> 00:17:59,761
of my life.

482
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:01,497
She treated me poorly.

483
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:02,831
We didn't connect.

484
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,333
I was miserable.

485
00:18:04,335 --> 00:18:08,704
Now I'm in the best relationship
of my life

486
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:11,640
with the same woman.

487
00:18:11,642 --> 00:18:14,743
Love is a mystery.

488
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,613
So we have all night,
where do you wanna go first?

489
00:18:17,615 --> 00:18:18,881
I don't know.

490
00:18:18,883 --> 00:18:19,982
How 'bout the U.N.?

491
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:22,184
How often do you come here?

492
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,086
Mm, every time
my sixth grade class

493
00:18:24,088 --> 00:18:25,087
goes on a field trip.

494
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:26,088
Well, I think you're

495
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,757
really going to enjoy this,
Adult Jim.

496
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:37,399
Hey, everybody.

497
00:18:37,401 --> 00:18:39,134
The next time you see me,
I will be working

498
00:18:39,136 --> 00:18:41,003
for corporate.

499
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,804
Starting tomorrow,
Dwight Schrute

500
00:18:42,806 --> 00:18:46,308
will be running the branch.

501
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,011
So without further ado...

502
00:18:51,182 --> 00:18:53,182
I would like to start saying
my good-byes.

503
00:19:00,691 --> 00:19:02,191
Okay.

504
00:19:06,964 --> 00:19:09,331
Good night.

505
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,933
And good luck.

506
00:19:23,213 --> 00:19:25,347
Who's ready to work?

507
00:19:28,117 --> 00:19:30,252
Yeah, we went to The Spotted Pig

508
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,720
for dinner, it's in the Village.

509
00:19:31,722 --> 00:19:33,155
Uh, Karen knew it.

510
00:19:33,157 --> 00:19:35,791
And then we second-acted
Spamalot.

511
00:19:35,793 --> 00:19:37,526
That's when you sneak in
at intermission

512
00:19:37,528 --> 00:19:39,027
with all the smokers.

513
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:42,164
And then we went to a bar
that used to be a church.

514
00:19:42,166 --> 00:19:45,234
Oh, and at this one bar,
I swear I saw Lorne Michaels.

515
00:19:45,236 --> 00:19:47,569
That wasn't him.

516
00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:50,072
So what's gonna happen with us

517
00:19:50,074 --> 00:19:51,640
when I get this job?

518
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:53,308
Oh, do you mean
when I get the job?

519
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,745
Well, if you get the job...

520
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,448
then I'd move here with you.

521
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:02,017
Would you move with me?

522
00:20:02,019 --> 00:20:03,619
I'm not stupid, okay?

523
00:20:03,621 --> 00:20:05,654
I was at the beach.

524
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,990
We don't have a future
in Scranton.

525
00:20:07,992 --> 00:20:11,126
There's
one too many people there.

526
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,428
You mean Kevin?

527
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,663
Exactly.

528
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:19,568
No, but you get it, right?

529
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,536
We can't stay there.

530
00:20:21,538 --> 00:20:23,672
Yeah.

531
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:25,974
I do.

532
00:20:25,976 --> 00:20:27,643
Come on.

533
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:42,524
How are you guys doing?
Need anything?

534
00:20:42,526 --> 00:20:44,493
Uh, no, we're good.
Thanks.

535
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:46,094
I have been here
a bunch of times,

536
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:47,596
so I know where everything is.

537
00:20:47,598 --> 00:20:48,964
Know everybody's names.

538
00:20:48,966 --> 00:20:50,632
If you need to know
somebody's name, just ask me.

539
00:20:53,337 --> 00:20:55,570
Who's that?

540
00:20:55,572 --> 00:20:57,406
That is Beardy.

541
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:58,440
Beardy?

542
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,474
Mm-hmm.

543
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,742
Why don't I introduce myself.

544
00:21:00,744 --> 00:21:01,943
No, no, no... just...
that's not his real name.

545
00:21:01,945 --> 00:21:04,613
That's just what I call him, so.

546
00:21:04,615 --> 00:21:06,381
I am by far
the most qualified person

547
00:21:06,383 --> 00:21:07,616
they're interviewing.

548
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,217
Jim and Karen are here.

549
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:10,585
Which is cute.

550
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:13,889
They're like kid actors
tagging along with Daddy

551
00:21:13,891 --> 00:21:15,390
on the big audition.

552
00:21:15,392 --> 00:21:17,125
Hoping to be discovered.

553
00:21:17,127 --> 00:21:20,829
Except Daddy
is the best actor around.

554
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:24,399
Daddy is Meryl Streep.

555
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:26,535
Michael is gone.

556
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:31,273
Hail to the Chief!

557
00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:32,541
My first order of business,

558
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:35,711
make Andrew Bernard
my number two.

559
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:38,513
My first order of business,
accept.

560
00:21:38,515 --> 00:21:40,282
As if you had a choice.

561
00:21:40,284 --> 00:21:41,917
Duh.

562
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,052
Opportunity of a lifetime.

563
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:48,657
Three months ago, I was nowhere.

564
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:52,160
I was just a Cornell grad
in anger management.

565
00:21:52,162 --> 00:21:53,729
Look where I am now.

566
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:56,631
Not bad.

567
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,970
Hey, Hunter!

568
00:22:01,972 --> 00:22:03,572
What's up, my brother?

569
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:06,441
This is Hunter,
secretary extraordinaire.

570
00:22:06,443 --> 00:22:08,477
Uh, administrative assistant.

571
00:22:08,479 --> 00:22:09,845
Is Jan in yet?

572
00:22:09,847 --> 00:22:11,012
I think she's coming in later.

573
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:12,013
Could you give her
a message for me

574
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:13,014
when she gets in?

575
00:22:13,016 --> 00:22:14,850
Sure.

576
00:22:14,852 --> 00:22:19,054
Just say
"I want to squeeze them."

577
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:21,289
It's code,
she'll know what it means.

578
00:22:21,291 --> 00:22:23,392
Okay.

579
00:22:23,394 --> 00:22:24,393
Oh, and Hunter?

580
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,561
Could you tell her "Brr," also?

581
00:22:30,199 --> 00:22:32,000
You showed
great leadership potential

582
00:22:32,002 --> 00:22:33,034
at the coal walk.

583
00:22:33,036 --> 00:22:34,469
Even if you did follow it

584
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,638
with that embarrassing
personal confession.

585
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,507
Thank you.

586
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:40,442
I had to make Andy
my number two.

587
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,110
It's political, complicated.

588
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,245
You wouldn't understand.

589
00:22:43,247 --> 00:22:47,315
I want you to be
assistant regional manager.

590
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:49,518
Really?

591
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,319
Well, in a sense.

592
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:53,088
Although publicly,
I am going to retain

593
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:56,024
the assistant regional manager
position.

594
00:22:56,026 --> 00:22:57,392
You will be your own assistant.

595
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:59,428
Correct, I need someone
I can trust.

596
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:01,530
But I would also like the title

597
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:03,932
to be secretly applied to you.

598
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:08,069
Just stripped
of its pomp and frills.

599
00:23:08,071 --> 00:23:10,338
Okay.

600
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:14,509
So you would be
the regional manager

601
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:17,446
and the assistant
regional manager.

602
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:19,514
Andy is your number two.

603
00:23:19,516 --> 00:23:23,218
I would be the secret
assistant regional manager.

604
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,386
Mm, let's call it
secret assistant

605
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:26,021
to the regional manager.

606
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:27,255
Mm-hmm.

607
00:23:27,257 --> 00:23:28,723
Do you accept?

608
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,493
Absolutely, I do.

609
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:32,861
I learned from Jim,

610
00:23:32,863 --> 00:23:35,363
if Dwight ever asks you
if you accept something secret,

611
00:23:35,365 --> 00:23:39,434
you reply,
"Absolutely, I do."

612
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:45,006
Hello, hello!

613
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:46,842
Michael, good to see you.

614
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,210
- Good to see you.
- Have a seat.

615
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,978
Here are the post-merger
performance stats

616
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,580
- that you asked for.
- Great.

617
00:23:51,582 --> 00:23:53,248
I've been meaning to thank you,
by the way.

618
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,550
You didn't lose
a single customer in the merger,

619
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:57,118
and you still managed
to trim the budget.

620
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,021
That is nice work.

621
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:03,458
So let me ask you a question
right off the bat.

622
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,926
What do you think
are your greatest strengths

623
00:24:04,928 --> 00:24:06,261
as a manager?

624
00:24:06,263 --> 00:24:09,064
Why don't I tell you
what my greatest weaknesses are?

625
00:24:09,066 --> 00:24:10,966
I work too hard.

626
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,400
I care too much.

627
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:16,771
And sometimes I can be
too invested in my job.

628
00:24:16,773 --> 00:24:18,907
Okay.

629
00:24:18,909 --> 00:24:20,642
And your strengths?

630
00:24:20,644 --> 00:24:24,079
Well, my weaknesses
are actually strengths.

631
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:27,415
Oh! Yes. Very good.

632
00:24:27,417 --> 00:24:28,416
Thank you.

633
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:29,417
Very good.

634
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:30,719
Dwight is our new boss.

635
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:32,821
Oh, Michael's
not going anywhere.

636
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:34,556
Then who do you think
will get the job?

637
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,991
Karen.

638
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:38,093
She looks corporate.

639
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:40,529
Those little pantsuits.

640
00:24:40,531 --> 00:24:41,963
I think it's gonna be Michael.

641
00:24:41,965 --> 00:24:43,832
Do you really think
he's qualified for that job?

642
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:46,568
No, but he wasn't qualified
for the job he has now,

643
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,802
and he got that one.

644
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:48,803
Yeah.

645
00:24:48,805 --> 00:24:49,905
Listen up!

646
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:52,274
Come to the center
of the room, please.

647
00:24:52,276 --> 00:24:55,110
This...

648
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:57,679
is a Schrute buck.

649
00:24:57,681 --> 00:24:59,180
When you have done
something good,

650
00:24:59,182 --> 00:25:02,684
you will receive
one Schrute buck.

651
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:04,486
1,000 Schrute bucks equals

652
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:07,022
an extra five minutes for lunch.

653
00:25:07,024 --> 00:25:10,158
What is the cash value
of a Schrute buck?

654
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,793
Excellent question, Pam.

655
00:25:11,795 --> 00:25:13,628
1/100th of a cent.

656
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:17,465
So 10,000 of your dollars
is worth one real dollar?

657
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,134
Just zip your lid.

658
00:25:19,136 --> 00:25:21,169
Another announcement.

659
00:25:21,171 --> 00:25:23,138
Michael wasted
an enormous amount

660
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,439
of the group's time and patience

661
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,908
with non-work-related
ethnic celebrations

662
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:29,878
and parades of soft-minded
do-good-edness.

663
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,413
No longer.

664
00:25:31,415 --> 00:25:33,648
No more meetings.

665
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,849
Amen.

666
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:37,786
Instead, today I will begin
my first lecture

667
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,155
in a long series of lectures
designed to increase

668
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:41,690
your knowledge
on the world of paper.

669
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:42,691
Do we have to?

670
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:44,392
Yes.
Michael is gone.

671
00:25:44,394 --> 00:25:47,329
There's a new sheriff here
in these offices.

672
00:25:47,331 --> 00:25:49,130
And his name is me.

673
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:51,499
Conference room, ten seconds.

674
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:52,534
All of you!

675
00:25:52,536 --> 00:25:54,603
I literally cannot wait
until I see

676
00:25:54,605 --> 00:25:56,738
what Dwight has planned.

677
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,140
And I wish Jim were here.

678
00:25:59,909 --> 00:26:02,210
What do you think
we could be doing better?

679
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:04,779
I've never been a big fan
of the name Dunder-Mifflin.

680
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,214
I was thinking we could
name the company

681
00:26:06,216 --> 00:26:09,184
something like Paper Great,

682
00:26:09,186 --> 00:26:11,086
where great paper
is our passion.

683
00:26:11,088 --> 00:26:13,655
We're grrreat!

684
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,558
I don't know, could be good.

685
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,026
Or, uh, Super Duper Paper.

686
00:26:18,028 --> 00:26:19,628
It's super duper.

687
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,496
I don't know,
something like that.

688
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,298
- Okay.
- Okay.

689
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,332
Thanks for coming in, Michael.

690
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:25,467
Thank you.

691
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:27,736
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

692
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:30,472
It is always a treat
when our paths cross.

693
00:26:30,474 --> 00:26:32,374
So... oh, before I forget.

694
00:26:32,376 --> 00:26:35,610
I wanted to let you know,
if you hadn't already heard,

695
00:26:35,612 --> 00:26:37,812
uh, Jan and I are back together.

696
00:26:37,814 --> 00:26:39,347
So I may need to fill out

697
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,416
one of those love documents
again.

698
00:26:41,418 --> 00:26:42,484
You're back together.

699
00:26:42,486 --> 00:26:44,819
Yes, and I am very excited
about the prospect

700
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:45,887
of working under her.

701
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:47,622
Or on top of her.

702
00:26:47,624 --> 00:26:50,425
Mm, that's not sexual,
just we're all professionals.

703
00:26:50,427 --> 00:26:52,127
Okay, well.

704
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:54,195
Uh, I thought it was clear
in the description

705
00:26:54,197 --> 00:26:56,231
of the position.

706
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:59,034
The job you're applying for
is Jan's job.

707
00:26:59,036 --> 00:27:00,335
I don't understand.

708
00:27:00,337 --> 00:27:02,170
So we're gonna tag team it?

709
00:27:02,172 --> 00:27:04,706
No, we're letting Jan go.

710
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:11,513
Listen up.
Let's start from the ground up.

711
00:27:11,515 --> 00:27:13,648
Where does paper come from?

712
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:16,317
Trees.

713
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:19,654
And where do trees grow?

714
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:21,089
- Forest.
- Soil.

715
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:22,657
Right.

716
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:25,360
We have in front of you here,

717
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:29,330
seven different types
of Pennsylvania topsoil.

718
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:34,869
Now, what would you say
is the most important element

719
00:27:34,871 --> 00:27:38,339
in the production
of aboveground leafy growth?

720
00:27:39,542 --> 00:27:41,843
Probably phosphorus, right?

721
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:42,844
Wrong.

722
00:27:42,846 --> 00:27:44,112
It's nitrogen.

723
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:47,315
Absorb this information.

724
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,818
Good.

725
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,886
Now, let us discuss
precipitation.

726
00:27:51,888 --> 00:27:52,887
Stanley.

727
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:54,489
When rainfall occurs,

728
00:27:54,491 --> 00:27:57,726
does it usually fall
in a liquid, solid,

729
00:27:57,728 --> 00:27:59,094
or gaseous state?

730
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:01,129
Liquid.

731
00:28:01,131 --> 00:28:02,430
Very good.

732
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,133
You have earned
one Schrute buck.

733
00:28:05,135 --> 00:28:07,001
I don't want it.

734
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:09,437
Then you have been deducted
50 Schrute bucks.

735
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,438
Make it 100.

736
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,707
Well...

737
00:28:12,709 --> 00:28:14,743
Don't you wanna earn
Schrute bucks?

738
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:17,779
No... In fact,
I'll give you a billion

739
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:20,315
Stanley nickels
if you never talk to me again.

740
00:28:20,317 --> 00:28:21,316
What's the ratio
of Stanley nickels

741
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:22,617
to Schrute bucks?

742
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,086
The same as the ratio
of unicorns to leprechauns.

743
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:26,321
- Okay.
- That's it!

744
00:28:26,323 --> 00:28:27,722
Class is cancelled,
everybody out.

745
00:28:27,724 --> 00:28:28,890
What? No, wait!
What are you doing?

746
00:28:28,892 --> 00:28:30,091
- I'm punishing them.
- No, no, no!

747
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:31,126
Class is not cancelled!

748
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:33,762
Hey! Come on!

749
00:28:33,764 --> 00:28:37,365
Let's listen
to Dwight's presentation.

750
00:28:39,068 --> 00:28:40,301
What... what
are you winking for?

751
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,336
Zip your lid!

752
00:28:41,338 --> 00:28:44,172
So that's my basic
five year plan.

753
00:28:44,174 --> 00:28:46,174
And then after that, who knows?

754
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:47,742
Okay.

755
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,111
And now, this may seem
like an odd question.

756
00:28:50,113 --> 00:28:51,946
Yeah?

757
00:28:51,948 --> 00:28:54,115
What do you think
about Michael Scott?

758
00:28:54,117 --> 00:28:55,717
He's a very nice man.

759
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:57,018
Mm-hmm.

760
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,687
And he's very well-suited
for the job he has now.

761
00:28:59,689 --> 00:29:01,122
This is off the record.

762
00:29:01,124 --> 00:29:03,124
He would be a disaster.

763
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,497
Hey, you!

764
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:11,666
Hey.

765
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,468
How was your interview?

766
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:14,803
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

767
00:29:14,805 --> 00:29:16,037
Could've gone better, I guess.

768
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:19,307
Oh, well, I will put in
a good word for you.

769
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:22,243
Cool. Maybe you should do it
sooner rather than later.

770
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:23,545
What?

771
00:29:23,547 --> 00:29:24,579
Uh, let's just run away
together.

772
00:29:24,581 --> 00:29:25,747
Let's run away to Jamaica,

773
00:29:25,749 --> 00:29:26,881
live in a bungalow.

774
00:29:26,883 --> 00:29:28,049
You have some savings, right?

775
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:29,050
You can pay off my debts.

776
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,919
It would be fine.

777
00:29:30,921 --> 00:29:32,053
We'd have fun.

778
00:29:32,055 --> 00:29:34,455
What's...
what's the matter?

779
00:29:34,457 --> 00:29:36,424
W-what happened
in there?

780
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,727
I can't tell you.

781
00:29:39,729 --> 00:29:41,296
Tell me what?

782
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,671
You son of a bitch.

783
00:29:49,673 --> 00:29:51,639
Jan, this isn't the time...

784
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:52,841
You're firing me?

785
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:54,642
Where the hell do you get off?

786
00:29:56,012 --> 00:29:57,812
Frankly, it's overdue.

787
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:00,081
Your behavior
in the last two years

788
00:30:00,083 --> 00:30:01,382
has been completely erratic.

789
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,051
Erratic?

790
00:30:03,053 --> 00:30:04,752
Recently, you don't even show
an interest in your work!

791
00:30:04,754 --> 00:30:06,721
You smoke constantly
in your office.

792
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:08,857
You spend most of the day
online shopping.

793
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:11,359
You disappear for hours
at a time, sometimes days,

794
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,895
always saying you're visiting
your sister in Scottsdale.

795
00:30:13,897 --> 00:30:15,864
You go to Scranton
far more often than you need to.

796
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:16,998
Is it because of these?

797
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,700
Whoa, hey, whoa, Jan...

798
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:20,001
I wanna know...
I wanna know!

799
00:30:20,003 --> 00:30:23,037
Because if it is, then...
then I will see you in court.

800
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,873
- It's not. It's not.
- No.

801
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:26,441
'Cause he likes them.
Okay?

802
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:29,277
He likes them, and that is...
that is all I care about.

803
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,712
The time has come for you to end

804
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,147
your professional relationship
with this company.

805
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:35,016
You are clearly unstable.

806
00:30:35,018 --> 00:30:36,117
Hey, you're unstable!

807
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:37,118
Yeah.

808
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,288
No.
We're all unstable.

809
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,890
Okay, you know what,
I'm just not leaving!

810
00:30:41,892 --> 00:30:43,791
I'm not leaving.

811
00:30:43,793 --> 00:30:45,593
Not leaving.

812
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:47,662
David, I did not tell her.

813
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:02,366
It's like I'm staring
into my soul

814
00:31:02,368 --> 00:31:03,568
when I look at this wall.

815
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,904
It's like outer space
without the stars.

816
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,239
It's so black.

817
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,775
This is gonna look so awesome!

818
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:11,909
It's so intimidating.

819
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,177
Anyone who comes in here

820
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:14,946
is gonna have to take me
seriously.

821
00:31:14,948 --> 00:31:17,815
Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here.

822
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:19,617
Totally.

823
00:31:30,329 --> 00:31:31,329
Bye, Hunter.

824
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:32,330
Bye.

825
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,766
Good luck with your band.

826
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,767
Oh, thank...

827
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,102
Don't let them change you.

828
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:39,704
Okay?

829
00:32:00,058 --> 00:32:02,293
So long,.

830
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:07,932
So I am gonna give her
a ride home.

831
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,700
Let me know about the job.

832
00:32:09,702 --> 00:32:11,469
Actually, Michael,
I think we're gonna take it

833
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,603
in another direction.

834
00:32:12,605 --> 00:32:14,272
Good, I'm glad we're
on the same page.

835
00:32:14,274 --> 00:32:15,907
I have a lot of ideas
for new directions.

836
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:18,776
No, we're not giving you
the job.

837
00:32:23,916 --> 00:32:24,949
You know what?

838
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:27,318
That is actually good

839
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,021
because, um...

840
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:33,090
I don't think I could take
my girlfriend's job.

841
00:32:33,092 --> 00:32:35,293
That's not being
a good boyfriend.

842
00:32:35,295 --> 00:32:39,964
So I respectfully withdraw
my name from consideration.

843
00:32:42,401 --> 00:32:44,101
Do you accept my withdrawal?

844
00:32:44,103 --> 00:32:45,903
- I do.
- Good, very good.

845
00:32:45,905 --> 00:32:48,339
I am glad we are finally
on the same page.

846
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,241
Still have my job
in Scranton though?

847
00:32:50,243 --> 00:32:51,609
Yes.
Good.

848
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:53,110
It's all I ever wanted.

849
00:32:53,112 --> 00:32:55,279
These two...

850
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,348
either one of them...

851
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,750
excellent candidates.

852
00:33:02,788 --> 00:33:04,188
Wow.

853
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:09,627
That was some serious,
hardcore self-destruction.

854
00:33:09,629 --> 00:33:10,895
Yeah.

855
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:12,496
Kinda feel bad for her though.

856
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:14,699
Don't. She's nuts.

857
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,402
Oh, man.

858
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:21,639
You know what?
This might take a while.

859
00:33:21,641 --> 00:33:23,641
You really don't have to stay,
if you don't want.

860
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:26,143
Okay, good, because a bunch
of my friends

861
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:27,778
are meeting downtown for lunch,

862
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:29,247
and I was gonna meet them.

863
00:33:29,249 --> 00:33:30,481
Okay.
So...

864
00:33:30,483 --> 00:33:31,515
Just call me when you're done.

865
00:33:31,517 --> 00:33:33,150
Sure.

866
00:33:33,152 --> 00:33:40,391
- Good luck, Halpert.
- Thank you.

867
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,827
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Grace.

868
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:45,029
Sure.

869
00:33:47,766 --> 00:33:49,000
Oh, God!

870
00:33:49,002 --> 00:33:50,568
I mean, I just don't understand.

871
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,570
It's just so rude, you know?

872
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,138
I mean, the absolute nerve
of that guy!

873
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,373
I am sorry about that.

874
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,574
- Oh, just...
- That was terrible.

875
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:58,209
No, actually, I think it's good.

876
00:33:58,211 --> 00:33:59,577
You know, it's fine actually.

877
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,745
I-I do.

878
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,613
I really think
it's great that it happened,

879
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:04,382
because, you know,
my work has always been

880
00:34:04,384 --> 00:34:05,383
the thing that's gotten
in the way

881
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:06,384
of my happiness, so...

882
00:34:06,386 --> 00:34:07,385
Mm-hmm, yeah.

883
00:34:08,388 --> 00:34:10,655
Well, it's...

884
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,629
No, don't cry.

885
00:34:18,631 --> 00:34:19,630
It's gonna be okay.

886
00:34:19,632 --> 00:34:21,932
Oh, I know, I know.

887
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,534
It's just...
I'm sorry.

888
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:25,603
It's just these painkillers
that I started taking

889
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,438
since the surgery.

890
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,542
Oh, they make my moods
totally unpredictable.

891
00:34:31,544 --> 00:34:32,943
Wow.

892
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,479
What am I gonna do?

893
00:34:38,283 --> 00:34:43,054
Well, I guess you could come
and stay at my condo.

894
00:34:43,056 --> 00:34:45,222
I think I could back out
of the sale.

895
00:34:45,224 --> 00:34:47,224
Probably get
some negative feedback

896
00:34:47,226 --> 00:34:48,526
on my eBay profile.

897
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:49,527
Live together...

898
00:34:49,529 --> 00:34:50,528
Actually, wait a minute.

899
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,529
This could be great.

900
00:34:51,531 --> 00:34:52,863
This could be perfect.

901
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:54,999
You know, my full-time job
could be our relationship.

902
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,233
I could wear stretch pants
and wait for you

903
00:34:56,235 --> 00:34:57,535
to come home at 5:15.

904
00:34:57,537 --> 00:34:58,669
It could work, this could work!

905
00:34:58,671 --> 00:35:00,504
Really.

906
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:12,183
I'll be back.

907
00:35:12,185 --> 00:35:15,720
And I am back.

908
00:35:15,722 --> 00:35:16,921
How'd it go?

909
00:35:16,923 --> 00:35:18,689
No. No, Pam.

910
00:35:18,691 --> 00:35:21,158
I'm back.

911
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,728
For good.

912
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:25,162
Kevin Nealon.

913
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,631
Everybody, may I have
your attention please?

914
00:35:27,633 --> 00:35:31,602
It is with great honor
and privilege

915
00:35:31,604 --> 00:35:34,405
that I announce to you,
I have officially withdrawn

916
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:37,274
my name for consideration
from the corporate job.

917
00:35:37,276 --> 00:35:39,977
I know, I know, I know.

918
00:35:39,979 --> 00:35:41,479
"Michael, what are you thinking?

919
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:42,480
You were a shoo-in."

920
00:35:42,482 --> 00:35:44,482
Well, got down there.

921
00:35:44,484 --> 00:35:46,283
I nailed the interview.

922
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,986
And the strangest thing
happened.

923
00:35:48,988 --> 00:35:51,789
Why is my office black?

924
00:35:51,791 --> 00:35:54,125
To intimidate my subordinates.

925
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:55,793
That's stupid.

926
00:35:55,795 --> 00:35:57,194
It was Andy's idea.

927
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:58,763
You shouldn't have taken it.

928
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:00,831
Bad management.

929
00:36:00,833 --> 00:36:04,068
Good thing I'm back.

930
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:06,103
Ryan, coffee.

931
00:36:06,105 --> 00:36:07,805
I don't do that stuff anymore.

932
00:36:07,807 --> 00:36:10,374
No, it's for me, bimbo.

933
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,475
Kids.

934
00:36:11,477 --> 00:36:13,477
So I'm back.

935
00:36:13,479 --> 00:36:20,518
And I am never, ever
going to leave.

936
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,088
I am going nowhere.

937
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,625
This place is like...

938
00:36:27,627 --> 00:36:30,895
the hospital where I was born,

939
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:33,564
my house,

940
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,735
my old age home,

941
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,904
and my graveyard...

942
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,440
for my bones.

943
00:36:42,442 --> 00:36:44,942
Did Karen get the job?

944
00:36:47,345 --> 00:36:48,946
Back to work.

945
00:36:48,948 --> 00:36:50,514
Still waiting on that coffee.

946
00:37:04,796 --> 00:37:06,130
Pam, hello.

947
00:37:06,132 --> 00:37:07,231
Dwight, hello.

948
00:37:07,233 --> 00:37:09,133
I wanted to thank you.

949
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:12,670
For helping me...

950
00:37:12,672 --> 00:37:14,271
when you held the title

951
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,441
of secret assistant
to the regional manager.

952
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:23,647
You served the office
with great dignity.

953
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:33,824
No, I don't know
what the future holds,

954
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:36,727
but I'm optimistic.

955
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:40,297
And, uh, I had fun goofing
around with Dwight today.

956
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:45,970
Jim and I are just too similar.

957
00:37:47,405 --> 00:37:51,075
Maybe one day I'll find
my own Karen.

958
00:37:51,077 --> 00:37:53,544
But... you... that is a, um...

959
00:37:53,546 --> 00:37:55,179
You know, not...

960
00:37:55,181 --> 00:37:56,547
A man.

961
00:37:56,549 --> 00:37:58,115
A man version.

962
00:37:58,117 --> 00:38:02,119
But, uh, until then...

963
00:38:02,121 --> 00:38:04,922
I can hold my head up.

964
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:06,991
I'm not gay.

965
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,160
I don't know how I feel
about hiring a Sixers fan.

966
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,695
I should leave.

967
00:38:12,632 --> 00:38:13,797
Now, let me ask you
a question, Jim.

968
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,399
You're clearly
a very bright guy.

969
00:38:15,401 --> 00:38:16,600
- Thanks.
- Always hit your numbers.

970
00:38:16,602 --> 00:38:18,702
Personable, you make
a great impression

971
00:38:18,704 --> 00:38:20,037
- on everyone you meet.
- I'm sorry, wait.

972
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:22,273
So is the question
how'd I get to be so awesome?

973
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:25,009
Because I don't have
an answer for you.

974
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,778
Oh, uh, hey, do you have
your quarterly numbers?

975
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,946
Yes, absolutely.

976
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:30,047
And that, uh, questionnaire?

977
00:38:30,049 --> 00:38:31,282
Sorry to make you fill
that thing out.

978
00:38:31,284 --> 00:38:33,350
- Oh, no, absolutely.
- Stupid HR formality.

979
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:36,320
We have this very irritating
HR guy here.

980
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:37,721
He's probably the only person
you're not gonna like.

981
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:41,492
Kendall. Ugh.

982
00:38:41,494 --> 00:38:43,827
So first up.

983
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:44,862
There you go.

984
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:45,863
How do you think you'd function

985
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,464
here in New York?

986
00:38:47,466 --> 00:38:49,600
What's that?

987
00:38:49,602 --> 00:38:51,368
Oh, uh, great.
You know?

988
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:54,038
I just, um, I really appreciate
the buildings,

989
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,440
and, uh, the people.

990
00:38:56,442 --> 00:38:59,944
And, um, there's just
an energy that New York has.

991
00:38:59,946 --> 00:39:01,211
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh...

992
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,881
Not to mention, they have places
that are open past 8:00.

993
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,616
So that's a bonus.

994
00:39:05,618 --> 00:39:06,750
You've been
in the Scranton branch

995
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,052
a long time.

996
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:11,555
What have you liked most
about that place?

997
00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:15,793
The friendships.

998
00:39:15,795 --> 00:39:17,161
Okay.

999
00:39:17,163 --> 00:39:19,697
Well, we want the person
who takes this position

1000
00:39:19,699 --> 00:39:21,832
to be here for the long haul.

1001
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:24,535
So... long haul.

1002
00:39:24,537 --> 00:39:26,403
Where do you see yourself
in ten years?

1003
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:37,915
How are your feet?

1004
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,483
Medium rare.

1005
00:39:39,485 --> 00:39:41,185
Thanks.

1006
00:39:43,588 --> 00:39:45,322
The real reason
that I went to Stamford

1007
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:49,660
was because I wanted to be...

1008
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:53,097
not here.

1009
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,699
I know.

1010
00:39:55,701 --> 00:40:00,571
And even though I came back,

1011
00:40:00,573 --> 00:40:02,673
I just feel like

1012
00:40:02,675 --> 00:40:06,877
I've never really come back.

1013
00:40:13,952 --> 00:40:16,186
Well, I wish you would.

1014
00:40:23,763 --> 00:40:26,864
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

1015
00:40:26,866 --> 00:40:28,932
Just one moment,
I'll transfer you.

1016
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:30,567
I haven't heard anything.

1017
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:32,836
But I bet Jim got the job.

1018
00:40:32,838 --> 00:40:34,138
I mean, why wouldn't he?

1019
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,573
He's totally qualified
and smart.

1020
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:38,842
Everyone loves him.

1021
00:40:38,844 --> 00:40:42,780
And if he
never comes back again,

1022
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:45,115
that's okay.

1023
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:47,418
We're friends.

1024
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:50,187
And I'm sure we'll stay friends.

1025
00:40:50,189 --> 00:40:52,923
We just... we never got
the timing right.

1026
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:54,358
You know?

1027
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,862
I shot him down, and then
he did the same to me, and...

1028
00:40:58,864 --> 00:40:59,863
But you know what?

1029
00:40:59,865 --> 00:41:01,465
It's okay.

1030
00:41:01,467 --> 00:41:03,667
I am totally fine.

1031
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,135
Everything
is gonna be totally...

1032
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,737
Pam. Sorry.

1033
00:41:06,739 --> 00:41:10,741
Um, are you free
for dinner tonight?

1034
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:12,176
Yes.

1035
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,444
All right.

1036
00:41:13,446 --> 00:41:17,047
Then it's a date.

1037
00:41:23,254 --> 00:41:25,322
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

1038
00:41:25,757 --> 00:41:29,293
So I know we left the other day
on a note of uncertainty,

1039
00:41:29,295 --> 00:41:30,994
but after some more thought,

1040
00:41:30,996 --> 00:41:33,964
I'm very pleased to be able
to offer you this job.

1041
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:36,066
Great.

1042
00:41:36,068 --> 00:41:37,801
I'm so glad.

1043
00:41:37,803 --> 00:41:39,803
We're all very excited
you're gonna be joining us.

1044
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:41,772
It'll be nice to have
another MBA around here.

1045
00:41:41,774 --> 00:41:44,441
I'm excited too.

1046
00:41:44,443 --> 00:41:46,143
Okay.

1047
00:41:46,145 --> 00:41:48,812
Bye.

1048
00:41:48,814 --> 00:41:49,813
Who was that?

1049
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:51,982
Nobody.

1050
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:53,450
You and I are done.

1051
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:55,519
What?!
