1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,086
Okay. Bye

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,510
Everyone, stop what you're
doing I have terrible news

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:13,554
Dwight is
no longer with us

4
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,888
What?
What?

5
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,849
He's gone, damn it

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,353
He's been promoted to
V.P. of Sabre Retail

7
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,730
and he's staying
in Florida forever

8
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,524
So, he's alive?

9
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:29,028
Yeah. That was him on the
phone He sounds wonderful.

10
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:31,613
Well, the way you said it made
it sound like he was dead

11
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,782
How could I have
been more clear?

12
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,243
He had a massive
stroke of good fortune

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,454
and he is now in
a better place.

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,457
If Dwight's not coming back does
that mean we can open his treasure?

15
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,669
You guys we've gone over
this there is no treasure

16
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,588
When the team
left for Tallahassee

17
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,257
Dwight told everyone
not to touch his treasure

18
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,092
Don't touch my treasure

19
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:53,886
Okay? You understand?

20
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:56,805
Obviously he wants us to obsess
about it There's nothing in there

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,268
Which is obviously what he
would want us to think,

22
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:03,979
making it the perfect
place to hide a treasure

23
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:07,024
Oh, God, I'm Wallace Shawn
in The Princess Bride.

24
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,318
Wanted us to realize

25
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:12,780
that this conversation among
friends is the true treasure.

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,573
No, no, no

27
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,326
I am dying to
know what's in there

28
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,245
Yeah, I know, Oscar. We all are.
But nobody's going to open it

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,538
You'd have to be insane

30
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,542
Hi. Hello

31
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,381
Now carefully open the box

32
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,638
It's a photo of all of us

33
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,016
Oh, that's so sweet

34
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,771
A dart?
Are you kidding me?

35
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:49,566
Who would put a poison dart Well, I
mean, I don't know that it's poisoned

36
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,613
God, I'm glad
he's okay though

37
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:55,989
Kind of sounds
like he deserved it

38
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,575
opening another man's
treasure and all. Wow

39
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:25,018
Well, Mister Ball it's been a
pleasure Now, give my regards to he

40
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,524
All right!
Well swung by VIPVP

41
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,402
I am loving the chemistry
between you two

42
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,321
Dwight is going to be
working alongside me

43
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:40,284
We are a regular Archibald
and his man George

44
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,665
Trick! There's no such thing
It's not even a real English duo

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:47,749
Ah

46
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:52,713
I just made you look like the Goat of
Dover. And that doesn't exist either

47
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,633
You think you're excited?
You should feel my nipples

48
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,427
Pong

49
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:02,097
Oh, that reminds me Little
something from all of us.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,559
Oh, my gosh. Thank you, Jim
That's so thoughtful.

51
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,859
Fore! Oh, yeah

52
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,986
He doesn't even care

53
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,448
This is the last time
I'll ever see Dwight.

54
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,201
It's a weird feeling
It's, um...

55
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:27,456
What's the word?
It's not "bittersweet.'

56
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,250
It's "sweet." Yeah

57
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,503
Hey, man.
Selling cookies for Jada

58
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,047
You want
the same as last year?

59
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,174
Would if I could
and I can so I will

60
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,802
Put me down for one box Don't
care what it is. Dealer's choice.

61
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,055
I'll put you down
for shortbreads

62
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,556
Damn it

63
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:47,184
Knock, knock. Hey

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,644
It's Sasha's
first year in the troop

65
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,978
so I'm selling
cookies for her

66
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,355
Anyway, would you
like some?

67
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,649
No. No
What?

68
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,485
I've been selling here for
five years This is my spot.

69
00:03:56,986 --> 00:04:00,781
You can't claim territories This is
the only place I interact with people

70
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,159
Why can't you sell it
at your church or barbershop?

71
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,330
Or chess club?

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,459
You know what? It's your first
time we'll split the office

73
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,089
You can have Sales the Annex,
Creed and I don't know.

74
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:19,299
I'll just take Accounting

75
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,512
That's it?
Yeah. Well, okay

76
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,889
Thanks, Darryl
Okay, great

77
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,017
All I need is Kevin.

78
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:31,478
Dude buys more cookies
than everyone combined.

79
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,771
And then some.

80
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,024
When I first started selling cookies,
he was a relatively thin man

81
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,736
Not a thin man, mind you
Relatively thin.

82
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,741
Hey, Lucy, I'm home
Babaloo

83
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,243
Here, let me help

84
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:50,998
so busy at the store today
Really good cheese nibbles

85
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,126
Irene hired me as
her live-in helper

86
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,044
We met at
the store launch.

87
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,797
I told her I was moving here
and I needed a place

88
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:00,549
and it just
sort of made sense.

89
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,259
I basically do
everything for her.

90
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,678
I run errands, I do chores
around the house.

91
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,096
I cook and clean.

92
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,890
Honestly, I don't know
how she survived without me

93
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:14,688
When can I introduce you to my grandson?
He's a wonderful swimmer

94
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,482
Shallow end, deep end
He does it all

95
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,985
Well, today might be
kind of tough, Irene

96
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,653
I have to talk to
my old boss, Andy

97
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,238
and tell him I'm
staying in Florida

98
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,079
Oh! What kind
of tea is this?

99
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:32,914
Oh, I boiled some Gatorade

100
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,920
Oh
Oh!

101
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:44,259
In England, they put the holes a
little bit to the right you see.

102
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,927
We'll just chalk it up
to cultural bias.

103
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:47,137
If I may

104
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:54,394
Try holding the putter you
know, with your wrists here,

105
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,730
and your thumbs here

106
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,273
Oh

107
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,984
That's right
Your little finger

108
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,445
Would you like to
buy some cookies?

109
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,323
Cookies, eh?

110
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,616
Mmm-hmm
Hmm

111
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:11,036
Oh, the spring time
thinks that it's the best

112
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,914
And fall time
thinks that it's the best

113
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,708
Cold time has
kind of a strut

114
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,669
And Valentine's
thinks that it's the best

115
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:22,547
But gather round, peeps
I'll tell you the truth

116
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:25,425
Nothing beats the cookie
season That's the truth

117
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,557
It's not
a scratch and sniff, Kev

118
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,519
I know. But sometimes you
still get a little something

119
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,063
Hey, you tricked me
You just wanted Kevin

120
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,732
You're new to the game.
You learned a lesson today

121
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,109
See you next year, sport

122
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,153
No, no, no, that's not fair What if
Kevin wants to buy cookies from me?

123
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,696
I do
See?

124
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:50,409
That doesn't mean anything Kevin,
do you want to buy cookies from me?

125
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,077
Oh, I definitely do

126
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,037
Huh. Hit the road, Jack

127
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,956
No, you hit the road, Jack

128
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,835
Hey, guys, come on
Don't fight over me.

129
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,003
Why don't we split the order?
It's only fair

130
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,132
No, wait, no. I'm buying.
I make the rules

131
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:08,051
I actually do want
you to fight over me

132
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:12,431
wined and dined
and sixty-nined

133
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,807
Ugh

134
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:18,937
Metaphorically sixty-nined
Ew! Perverts

135
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,398
No offense, Oscar

136
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,195
Hop in! We have places to be!
No rest for the wicked

137
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:31,283
All right
so I guess this is it

138
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:35,036
Well, Jim, I just want to say that
we haven't always gotten along

139
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:37,289
And, at times, I've even
hated your guts, but

140
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,878
Bye, bye. I win

141
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:45,964
Good-bye, Dwight

142
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,384
Robert! Race you to the
clubhouse Gentleman's bet!

143
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,719
Whoo-hoo

144
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,185
Well, he's
Florida's problem now

145
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,520
Oh, let Dwight
have his fun.

146
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,772
Today will not be his day

147
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:03,940
What's that?

148
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,484
I'm going to
tank the Sabre store

149
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,818
at the presentation
to the board

150
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,153
I thought you
liked the store

151
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,322
No, the store is lovely

152
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,701
You created a wonderful space
to showcase our product line

153
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,244
Great job. Cheers

154
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,580
Thank you

155
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:24,336
But there's a reason we sell our
products online and over the phone

156
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,255
Have you ever used
Sabre electronics, Jim?

157
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,549
They're cheap,
they're unintuitive

158
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,176
The Sabre store
would work

159
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,802
if we adopted
the carnival mode

160
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,763
of leaving town once
everyone's wise to us

161
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,934
Wow. When you put it that way, I
guess it does sound pretty terrible

162
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,938
I couldn't just kill the project from
the start Jo Bennett endorsed it.

163
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,524
Shame, though.
I did like Dwight

164
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:51,112
Robert, I'm going to win! Ha-ha!
I'm the gentleman Suck it!

165
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,573
Bravo, Dwight
Very good!

166
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,118
Shame

167
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,956
DWIGHT
The math is simple, folks

168
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:05,835
Deeper market penetration plus greater
visibility will raise Sabre...

169
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,838
To the power of two
To the power of two

170
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,259
How did that look?

171
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:13,343
I'm not just
saying this,

172
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,762
that was the best
thing I've ever seen

173
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,639
Told you

174
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,849
When you guys do that whole
"power of two" shebang

175
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,768
how about I pop up also?

176
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,771
Say "power of three.'

177
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,816
Actually you know what?
Yeah, that actually works

178
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,568
You'd spin off right
I'd spin off

179
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,027
You know what?
That is a great idea

180
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,529
Cathy, write that down
and print it out

181
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:33,905
It's going to make some
really good toilet paper

182
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,782
All right.
There he is

183
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,492
What are you doing here?
I thought I got rid of you.

184
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,160
Can I just talk to you
for one quick second?

185
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,663
What? Your stylist
ran out of messy spray?

186
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,917
Um, actually, it's for your
own good I think we should...

187
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,252
You want to do
something for my own good?

188
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,587
Turn around,
walk out that door

189
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,921
Do not stop until
you get to Scranton

190
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,674
Find my cell phone charger mail
it back to me and then go to hell

191
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,889
Nice. Hey, Halpert, anyone ever
tell you you look like Wooly Willy?

192
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,808
Silence

193
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,560
I'm just trying to

194
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:05,270
I know what
you're trying to do

195
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,650
But your face does look like
the guy from Operation.

196
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,071
It's the same guy.
That's the joke I made

197
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,531
Different guy
You know what

198
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:17,699
I just think
you should know

199
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,035
That you look like
the world's tallest hobbit

200
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,584
Well, I tried. You saw it
So, it's on the record.

201
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,632
Can you help me? I'm trying to
make a video chat with Andy

202
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,967
Just open the program
and type in his username

203
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,469
Can you just do it?

204
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,059
You type in your password

205
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,020
Erin, one, two, three

206
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,147
That's a terrible password

207
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:50,815
And you don't
make a video chat

208
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,067
You video chat.
All right

209
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,074
Hello.

210
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,534
That's so weird. There's
something wrong with my laptop

211
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,828
Oh

212
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,751
Now mine's broken
Hang on.

213
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,173
Oh, there we go

214
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,844
He said "I did like Dwight"?
He's going to fire him.

215
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,304
No, no, no, I think it was more like

216
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,139
"I liked him,
but I don't anymore

217
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:25,684
"because he did a bad job so I'm
definitely going to yell at him."

218
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:26,851
Robert doesn't
talk like that.

219
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,436
You have to stop Dwight
from doing this.

220
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,480
He will not listen

221
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,107
Did you actually
try your hardest?

222
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,110
Yes. My pretty hardest

223
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,779
Look, you haven't dealt with
him in a while, all right?

224
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,947
He's like Super Dwight

225
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:42,575
It's like he's been bitten by a
radioactive Dwight or something

226
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:43,743
Stanley, back me up

227
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,953
Don't talk to me

228
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,788
Stanley's very upset
that we're leaving Florida

229
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,248
but he would back me up

230
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:51,418
If Dwight's about to get
fired, you have to tell him.

231
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:53,628
Just get the words out,
that's all you can do.

232
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,755
Okay. All right

233
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,259
What's a skinny guy like Toby
know about cookies?

234
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,552
You can't trust
him to understand

235
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:02,721
the wants and needs
of the thick man

236
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,305
Maybe Toby from
two years ago.

237
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,724
Yeah
That's true

238
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,976
If I have a question about
my cookies at midnight

239
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,310
who am I going to call?

240
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,273
Darryl Toby's probably
in bed with some model.

241
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,524
Thank you

242
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,234
I'm not going to comment
on my personal life

243
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:20,447
Look, I need this. Okay, your
daughter is a pretty little girl.

244
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,323
Let her go door to door

245
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:26,745
You think people are going to buy
cookies from my chubby daughter?

246
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,163
Ooh

247
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,083
Baby, if you're watching this you're
not chubby. You're beautiful.

248
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,335
Daddy's just got to
sell some cookies

249
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,757
And we're also going to exercise
more It's going to be fun.

250
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,176
Oh. You know what you
have to do to decide?

251
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,428
You need to make them do things
for you and buy you things

252
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:47,182
Or have them sing that song that
the frog does in Looney Tunes.

253
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,725
Make them kiss each other

254
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,810
Make them kiss me

255
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,854
Ew

256
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,816
Yes, this is, too, tan

257
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,651
This right here.
No

258
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,945
This is a tan spot.

259
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,657
I don't buy it. And that is a freckle.
That is not a tan, okay?

260
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,202
I'm going to have to inspect it
in person when you get back here

261
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,664
I want you looking totally
Puertorriquena when I see you.

262
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,417
Well, Andy,
I'm not coming back

263
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,461
What?

264
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,756
I have a job here.
I work for an old lady.

265
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,674
Hello.

266
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,927
Andy?

267
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,138
Yeah, that's awesome
That's great

268
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:32,185
Oh, baby, telephone

269
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:37,649
And tell me I'm your own

270
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,985
Okay, this is tough
because Darryl,

271
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,363
you sang better and
you danced better

272
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,950
but Toby has that indescribable
quality that makes a star.

273
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:51,246
I think I've
reached my decision

274
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:56,042
I've decided that you guys are
going to keep doing things for me.

275
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,962
No, no, no, no
It's not worth it

276
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,171
No

277
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,590
No, it's not worth it?
That's too bad

278
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,260
Because I was feeling
particularly hungry this year.

279
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,637
Yeah, okay, so what?
You buy 40 boxes?

280
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:09,305
Hungrier

281
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,140
50?

282
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,184
Hungrier

283
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,729
You're not
talking triple digits?

284
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,982
Oh, yeah
I'm talking triple digits

285
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,444
Again

286
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,698
Hello, ma baby
Hello, ma honey

287
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,992
Hello, ma ragtime gal

288
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:31,870
It's show time

289
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:32,954
Dwight

290
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,999
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing
you away you keep flying back

291
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,584
You're like
an Amish return stick

292
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,210
Okay, great, listen
listen to me.

293
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,628
No, no, no, no

294
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,130
Will you just let me
tell you one thing, please?

295
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,673
Yes, you may tell
me one thing Great

296
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,133
Wait, do you want to borrow money?
Listen to me

297
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,968
Robert is going to
veto the Sabre store

298
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,136
Jim, come on

299
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,888
Dwight, he's going to kill the store.
Mmm-hmm.

300
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,140
And then I'm pretty sure
he's going to fire you for it

301
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,644
Wait he's going to kill the store
and he's going to fire me?

302
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,812
Yes

303
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,188
That's two things

304
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:00,899
Dwight, please
Nice try, Jim.

305
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:02,233
Your pranks have
never worked in the past

306
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,735
and they're not
going to work today

307
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,944
Okay, first of all
they've mostly worked so

308
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,738
You know what? You might
want to get to the airport.

309
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,531
It's going to take you a long
time to get through security

310
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,992
with all those
beauty products Bye

311
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,493
Dwight, come on

312
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,080
Nothing is going to stop me
That is the mark of a great man

313
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:18,041
Unstoppability

314
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:24,005
Dunder Mifflin, the farm Mose, all those
things vanish in my rearview mirror

315
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,760
Now, if you'll excuse me I
have a date with destiny

316
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,720
And from what I hear
she's a

317
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,643
Help! Help

318
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:40,313
Gross, don't lick my hand God,
why is there so much saliva?

319
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,606
All I had to do
was think about pie

320
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,899
and my salivary glands
did the rest.

321
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,275
Gross! What?
What? What? What?

322
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,569
Oh, God, Jim!
Oh! My appendix

323
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:47,695
I'm sorry

324
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,489
My wound hasn't healed yet.
I'm so sorry I'm sorry.

325
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,115
Oh, man. I'm so sorry I forgot.

326
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,076
Are you all right?
Are you okay?

327
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,124
Where the hell is he?
I cannot do this without him

328
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,417
He's not picking up

329
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,798
Looks like
Shnoot's a no-show

330
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,801
Guess he wasn't vice
prezzy material after all

331
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,135
But I am

332
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,720
Put me in, babe

333
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,432
I've got the info down backwards,
forwards and doggy style.

334
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,558
I'm your man

335
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,562
Right.
Let's begin then

336
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,524
Ladies and gentlemen
allow me to introduce

337
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:29,153
the vice president of Sabre
Retail, Mister Todd Packer

338
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,906
What's up?

339
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,166
What are you doing?

340
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,502
I'm just dealing
with Erin's stuff

341
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,337
since apparently
she's not coming back

342
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:47,630
and she didn't
bother to tell anyone

343
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,549
We knew.
Ryan told us

344
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,593
Ryan, why didn't you
tell me?

345
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,970
Thought you
checked my Tumblr

346
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:55,930
You never update it

347
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:57,515
Well, I updated it

348
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,185
Does anyone else
think this is weird?

349
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,438
Like, kind of
uncool, actually?

350
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,814
To leave us without
a receptionist?

351
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,858
We'll find
another receptionist

352
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,776
I mean, that's easy
We'll be fine

353
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,867
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to.

354
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:17,076
Get up. Get up

355
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,536
Okay. Okay

356
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,954
All right? I'm not
going to let you by.

357
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:23,207
Then you know what? I'm going to
just have to run right through you

358
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,501
Okay
What are you doing?

359
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,962
Are you really revving up?
You know that doesn't work

360
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,131
Jackie Chan

361
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,427
Go

362
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,887
Hi, this is Alex.

363
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,972
And this is Sam.

364
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,143
"Kevin can't come to the phone right
now because he's busy with us.'

365
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,519
Perfect

366
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:46,189
Now people w think I'm
doing hot girls all day

367
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,649
They might think
we're drag queens

368
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,360
Yeah, I don't know why you picked
names that were also guys' names

369
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,905
Okay, now who do I ride to
the kitchen like a pony?

370
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,490
Don't make me be
your pony, Kevin.

371
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,158
Forget it, man

372
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,161
What do you mean?
I'm out. So is Toby.

373
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,288
This may be wrong
but there's a limit

374
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,040
to what I will do
for my child.

375
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,000
Yeah.
I have my dignity, too

376
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,295
another man's horsey

377
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,508
No, guys, stop! You
have to sell me cookies

378
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,468
I'll do anything

379
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,888
Hello, my baby
Hello, my honey

380
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:20,431
I'm even going
to kiss Meredith

381
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,021
Mmm

382
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,190
That's so good

383
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,778
What are you doing?
No, no, no, no!

384
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,988
This ends now
This is dangerous.

385
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,573
Thunder slam

386
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,200
No

387
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,207
Anything else you
need to talk about?

388
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,292
Nope. That was it

389
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:58,594
Once again,
it's show time

390
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:06,144
What baffles me is how you could
take a perfectly good idea

391
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,564
which the great Jo Bennett
rightfully signed off on

392
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:12,400
and then, utterly
botch it in execution

393
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,735
If I may speak to that

394
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,571
I have only
been vice president

395
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,322
of this project for
the last half-hour

396
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,575
so the man you want
is Dwight Schrute.

397
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,535
I don't see Dwight

398
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,078
He clearly had
the infinite wisdom

399
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,415
to stay as far away from
this clown show as possible.

400
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:32,879
Whatever you do,
do not blame Todd Packer

401
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,423
It is not his fault

402
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:39,093
Blame his upbringing
His parents

403
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,680
The society that would
mold this idiotic creature

404
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,765
Fire the employee, yes

405
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,726
But not the man

406
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:50,188
You may not
cancel his soul

407
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,772
That was never
on the table.

408
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,608
Are you kidding?

409
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,985
She's the queen of the
whole frigging magilla.

410
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,696
And yet, Todd,
it's you who's fired

411
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,158
Wait, I can't get fired
I'm an institution.

412
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,160
Company for 20 years

413
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,995
How many of you have
been here that long? Huh?

414
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,977
Hey, hey, they're back

415
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,814
Hi! Oh, my gosh!
Look at you guys

416
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:34,941
Dwight, what are you
doing here?

417
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,442
I thought you were
supposed to be in Florida

418
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,861
Yeah, the crazy thing
about that is, um...

419
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,155
Wow, you look great.
Did you lose some weight?

420
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,200
Thank you. For someone
who actually noticed this

421
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,744
no, I didn't lose weight
but I started using my makeup

422
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,079
to contour my face
to look skinnier.

423
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,497
I actually put on
five pounds

424
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,500
Hey, good to
have you back

425
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,918
Good to be back

426
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,047
Hey, stranger
Hey

427
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,132
Oh, I missed you
I missed you.

428
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,179
Oh

429
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,433
I'm going to Florida
to get Erin.

430
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,150
Forgot to turn off my email
It's crazy, right?

431
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:19,443
It's just when she
said she was leaving

432
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,904
"You're about to
close four tabs,

433
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,072
"are you sure you
want to continue?'

434
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,657
Yes, I am sure

435
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,369
Ah! Slow computer
