1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:03,259
Hey. Ready?

2
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:06,744
Come on.
Show me excited.

3
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:11,253
Yes. Yeah, I'm
pretty excited, too.

4
00:00:11,326 --> 00:00:14,727
Today, I'm headed over to the job
fair at Valley View High School

5
00:00:14,796 --> 00:00:17,196
to find some
new interns.

6
00:00:17,265 --> 00:00:19,529
Want to get
some fresh blood.

7
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,159
Youth-anize this place.

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:22,566
Hey, we doing this thing?
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,637 --> 00:00:26,334
Oh, my God, Darryl. You
look like Barack Obama.

10
00:00:26,408 --> 00:00:27,636
Everybody, I'm
dating Barack Obama.

11
00:00:27,709 --> 00:00:29,404
Why are you dressed like that?
Like what?

12
00:00:29,477 --> 00:00:31,445
Like you're applying
for a loan?

13
00:00:31,513 --> 00:00:33,947
Maybe he's going
to church or court.

14
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,539
F'igured I'd look presentable.
Yeah.

15
00:00:35,617 --> 00:00:37,881
You went
a different way.

16
00:00:37,952 --> 00:00:39,385
I think you look nice.
Thank you.

17
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:40,978
Okay, here's what
we're going to do.

18
00:00:41,056 --> 00:00:44,423
I am going to instruct the kids
about management and sales.

19
00:00:44,492 --> 00:00:46,653
Oscar will be in
charge of accounting,

20
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:49,094
Pam will be
eye candy.

21
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:52,827
No, and also because
that is your alma mater.

22
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:55,335
Darryl will hire some
kids for the warehouse.

23
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:57,496
We don't have to worry about
internships with them,

24
00:00:57,572 --> 00:00:59,369
because they definitely
ain't going to college.

25
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,272
What college did
you go to, Mike?

26
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:02,604
Let's go!

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,235
Today, I am meeting a potential
client on the golf course

28
00:01:38,313 --> 00:01:41,111
because Ryan put
me on probation.

29
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:44,015
You remember Ryan,
he was the temp here.

30
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:48,488
Yeah. And it is not a good
time for me to lose my job,

31
00:01:48,556 --> 00:01:52,754
since I have some pretty big long term
plans in my personal life with Pam,

32
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,886
that I'd like her parents
to be psyched about.

33
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:59,297
So I'm about to do something very bold at
this job, that I've never done before.

34
00:02:00,468 --> 00:02:01,526
Try.

35
00:02:04,472 --> 00:02:06,531
Mr. Maguire, it's been
a couple of years.

36
00:02:06,608 --> 00:02:08,508
Hey, Jim. How are you?
Nice to see you.

37
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:11,636
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no.

38
00:02:11,713 --> 00:02:15,205
My grandfather would be
spinning in his urn

39
00:02:15,283 --> 00:02:17,513
if he knew that I was out
here with a Dartmouth boy.

40
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:20,884
You take that shirt off right now,
or I will take it off for you, sir.

41
00:02:20,955 --> 00:02:23,685
I am totally and
completely kidding!

42
00:02:24,893 --> 00:02:27,020
Andrew Bernard,
Cornell, '95.

43
00:02:27,095 --> 00:02:28,960
Phil Maguire,
Dartmouth, '74.

44
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,054
Got some blistees.

45
00:02:30,131 --> 00:02:31,189
Yeah, you do.

46
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:34,029
Hit about twelve hundred balls last
night in preparation for today,

47
00:02:34,102 --> 00:02:36,263
so hands are
a little tender.

48
00:02:37,305 --> 00:02:39,569
It's actually not funny at all.
It's incredibly painful.

49
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:42,542
Yeah, let's make it interesting.
Say, 10 bucks a hole?

50
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,601
Great. What are we talking?
Skins?

51
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:46,977
Acey Ducey?
Bingo Bango Bongo?

52
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:50,142
Sandies? Barkies?
Arnies? Wolf? What?

53
00:02:50,218 --> 00:02:54,814
I'm going to take this petty
cash that I got from Oscar

54
00:02:54,889 --> 00:02:57,722
and turn it into
next month's rent.

55
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:04,957
So many memories
in this old gym.

56
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,434
Pretending to have PMS, so I
didn't have to play volleyball.

57
00:03:08,503 --> 00:03:11,199
Pretending to have PMS, so I
didn't have to play basketball.

58
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,102
Those were the days.

59
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,880
Little over the top,
don't you think?

60
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,417
Show them what
you brought, Mike.

61
00:03:24,118 --> 00:03:25,881
That's all we brought.
This is all we need.

62
00:03:25,954 --> 00:03:28,445
We'll see.
Yes, we will see, Oscar.

63
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:34,325
We will see, because a blank sheet of
paper equals endless possibilities.

64
00:03:34,395 --> 00:03:36,625
Conceptual.
All right.

65
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:40,293
We are open
for business.

66
00:03:44,105 --> 00:03:45,299
Hello.

67
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,174
Andy, you're up.
Let's go.

68
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,044
Giddy up.
Let's do this.

69
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,083
People assume
I'm great at golf,

70
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,210
but, like everybody, I hated
golf lessons when I was a kid,

71
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:02,779
so I used to just hang out
with the sailing club instead.

72
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,715
Got my knot on.

73
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:07,990
Damn it!

74
00:04:11,332 --> 00:04:13,562
Guys, do we have
to stay all day?

75
00:04:13,635 --> 00:04:15,796
I mean, Michael's gone.
Can't we just go?

76
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,770
Yeah, and I finished
my work months ago.

77
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,932
Okay,
excuse me, people.

78
00:04:20,008 --> 00:04:22,476
It has come to my attention
that some of you have forgotten

79
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,135
who is
in charge here.

80
00:04:24,212 --> 00:04:27,773
When Michael is gone,
Jim is in charge.

81
00:04:27,849 --> 00:04:30,374
When Jim is gone, Andy
and I are in charge.

82
00:04:30,451 --> 00:04:33,750
When Andy is gone,
you answer to me.

83
00:04:33,821 --> 00:04:35,379
Okay?

84
00:04:35,456 --> 00:04:37,390
Excuse me, where do you
think you're going?

85
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,790
Oh, no, no, no.
You are not leaving.

86
00:04:39,861 --> 00:04:42,853
No! Stanley, do not
walk out that door.

87
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,058
If you walk out that door,
so help me, I will...

88
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,167
He left.

89
00:04:50,238 --> 00:04:55,141
Last time I checked, the American
work day ends at 5:00 p.m.

90
00:04:55,209 --> 00:04:58,906
You will all stay at your
desks until that time.

91
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,540
Or you will suffer
the consequences.

92
00:05:01,616 --> 00:05:03,311
What consequences?

93
00:05:04,552 --> 00:05:06,179
I will tell on you.

94
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:10,348
There is some filing, restocking
of the supply shelves,

95
00:05:10,425 --> 00:05:13,622
replacing the water jug,
which nobody likes to do.

96
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:18,226
We eat a lot of cake.

97
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,460
Cool.

98
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:23,504
Yeah, and, you know, you basically
learn how an office runs.

99
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:26,699
Hello. Hi, can I talk
to you for a sec? So...

100
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:28,867
Excuse me. This is Michael, my boss.
Justin.

101
00:05:28,943 --> 00:05:32,902
Hey. Remember what we talked about
in the car, on the way out?

102
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,710
"Only the best
and the brightest."

103
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:37,375
He's nice, and
he seems interested.

104
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:40,012
He's totally
wrong, Pam.

105
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:41,555
Hey.
Hi.

106
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:47,583
How you doing? Listen, I don't think
that a handsome, funny, smart,

107
00:05:47,662 --> 00:05:50,460
funny-looking kid like you
should limit himself.

108
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:53,398
You could do whatever you want to do.
You could be a classy janitor

109
00:05:53,468 --> 00:05:56,164
or a cashier
with dignity

110
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:00,003
or a migraine worker.

111
00:06:01,776 --> 00:06:04,336
Maybe, for you, paper
should be more of a hobby.

112
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:05,504
Sorry for wasting
your time.

113
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,979
Oh, no problem.

114
00:06:07,048 --> 00:06:11,246
And he signed. Did he put
his name on the piece of...

115
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,255
Okay, that was supposed
to be a blank canvas

116
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,484
on which to put
their hopes and dreams,

117
00:06:17,558 --> 00:06:21,722
and he just made it into
a stupid piece of paper.

118
00:06:21,796 --> 00:06:23,991
We need another one.
Immediately.

119
00:06:24,065 --> 00:06:26,056
Yeah, the booth
is lame without it.

120
00:06:26,134 --> 00:06:27,294
I only brought
the one.

121
00:06:27,368 --> 00:06:29,495
Are you mental?

122
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,504
Michael, do you remember
you specifically told me

123
00:06:31,572 --> 00:06:33,631
to only bring one
sheet of paper?

124
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,767
You said it only takes one
sheet to make a difference,

125
00:06:35,843 --> 00:06:39,370
and I said, "Are you sure, Michael?"
And you said, "Pam, Pam, Pam,"

126
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:42,905
and then you sneezed in my tea, and then you
said, "Don't worry, it's just allergies."

127
00:06:42,984 --> 00:06:45,475
Do you remember that? I don't.

128
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,156
Okay, I'll go look
for another one.

129
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:55,719
And that is why
I need a smart intern.

130
00:06:57,031 --> 00:06:59,556
Hey, so, how's the direct
mail business going?

131
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,659
I can't complain. People
love their junk mail.

132
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:04,364
Now, are you getting all
your paper from PPC or...

133
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,068
You know what, Jim? I'm not really
looking to change things up right now.

134
00:07:08,142 --> 00:07:10,235
I just came out here to get out
of the office a little bit,

135
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:12,176
so why don't we
just play, okay?

136
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:13,873
Absolutely. Will do.

137
00:07:14,849 --> 00:07:18,307
So, I guess I'll just
work on my short game.

138
00:07:25,326 --> 00:07:27,294
Hello there.

139
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:28,919
What is this company?

140
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:33,626
Well, it's funny that you should ask,
because it's really more than a company.

141
00:07:33,701 --> 00:07:35,168
Dunder Mifflin Paper.

142
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:36,669
Thanks.

143
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:38,967
Okay.
Damn it, Oscar.

144
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,508
Yeah, I'm trying to lure
these kids into my booth,

145
00:07:41,576 --> 00:07:46,343
but kids are very wary
of being lured these days.

146
00:07:46,647 --> 00:07:48,410
Thank you, Dateline.

147
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:52,185
Thank you.

148
00:08:03,432 --> 00:08:04,694
Extension 128.

149
00:08:04,766 --> 00:08:06,597
Hiya, pumpkin,
it's Creed.

150
00:08:06,668 --> 00:08:09,136
So, we're gonna ditch this bitch.
You in?

151
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:10,865
No.
Are you out?

152
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:15,004
Pumpkin's out.
Let's go, gang.

153
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:37,925
My old art room.

154
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,899
Oh, maybe
it's still here.

155
00:08:49,912 --> 00:08:53,075
No, no, they must have taken it down.
Never mind.

156
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:04,358
What do you want? Michael,
I know you're swamped.

157
00:09:04,426 --> 00:09:07,793
I just thought you should know that
everyone in the office has left,

158
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,490
except for Angela and I.

159
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:11,931
Do not worry, though. I have
taken down their names,

160
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,161
and I have docked
them a personal day.

161
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:17,831
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there.
Why should they have to be there?

162
00:09:19,474 --> 00:09:20,873
So, what
else is up?

163
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,005
Mike?

164
00:09:33,255 --> 00:09:37,214
Thank you.
What is this?

165
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:40,022
A piece of paper. This isn't
Dunder Mifflin paper.

166
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,393
This is some sort
of Pendleton crap.

167
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,022
Well, I think they'll
get the spirit of it.

168
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:47,068
Pam, Pam, Pam!
We're dying here.

169
00:09:47,135 --> 00:09:51,162
I want you to go back to the office,
and I want you to get the real stuff.

170
00:09:51,239 --> 00:09:53,400
I want you to get
ultra white card stock.

171
00:09:53,475 --> 00:09:54,601
Are you serious?

172
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:56,667
Yes, and don't
call me Shirley.

173
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,540
Okay.

174
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:09,122
Damn it.

175
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,386
You could just pick it up,
take the triple bogey.

176
00:10:15,464 --> 00:10:18,194
Yeah, I'll get it out.
Thank you. Yup.

177
00:10:47,896 --> 00:10:49,887
Oh, man.
Come on, Tuna.

178
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,963
Hey, can't really talk now.
What's up?

179
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,698
- Just checking in.
- How's it going?

180
00:10:57,906 --> 00:11:01,171
You know, we'll see. We'll see.

181
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,438
I just drove 20 miles round
trip back to the office

182
00:11:03,512 --> 00:11:06,174
to get Michael a single
sheet of white paper.

183
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:10,116
So, I could've just had
them fax it to me, I guess.

184
00:11:10,185 --> 00:11:11,413
Oh, I like you.

185
00:11:11,486 --> 00:11:12,919
Talk to you later?

186
00:11:12,988 --> 00:11:15,388
Yeah.
All right. Bye.

187
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,397
All right.

188
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:26,127
I'm sorry, I've got to
annoy you one more time.

189
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:28,362
What if I bring down
shipping costs?

190
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:31,895
You can try. But I've
looked at your prices.

191
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:33,941
Even with
free shipping,

192
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,672
doesn't work.

193
00:11:36,745 --> 00:11:39,009
It's just... It's not
in the stars, Jim.

194
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:45,453
Six. Yeah.
All right.

195
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,421
All right,
race to the next hole.

196
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,355
Winner gets ten bucks.

197
00:11:50,425 --> 00:11:52,120
Wait, wait for me!

198
00:11:52,194 --> 00:11:54,526
Shortcut, shortcut.

199
00:12:01,436 --> 00:12:03,427
I fell in the sand trap.

200
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,990
All of these jobs suck.

201
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,858
I would rather live jobless
on a beach somewhere

202
00:12:27,929 --> 00:12:29,897
off the money from
a large inheritance

203
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:32,456
than have to work in any
one of these crap holes.

204
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:34,665
They suck.

205
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:39,037
Hey, game over.

206
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:45,957
Just-in time.
Hi.

207
00:12:46,032 --> 00:12:49,331
Just-in case.
What's your last name?

208
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,863
Polznik.
This just in,

209
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,407
Justin Polznik.

210
00:12:56,909 --> 00:13:02,506
Justin is the ugly girl in the movie, who
takes off her glasses and she's hot.

211
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,380
And you realize that she was always
hot, she was just wearing glasses,

212
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,817
and that you were
the blind one.

213
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:12,279
He's the most important
thing in my life right now.

214
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,156
I want you to meet my family.
Come on.

215
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,956
Oscar Martinez, accountant extraordinaire.
This is Justin.

216
00:13:19,032 --> 00:13:20,294
Hey.
Hi.

217
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:23,529
This is Darryl Philbin.
Isn't he big?

218
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:26,697
And you already met her.
Pam Beesly, office hottie.

219
00:13:26,773 --> 00:13:28,400
She will do you.

220
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:34,007
No, no, but she has already dated two
guys in the office that we know of,

221
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,843
so this could be
number three.

222
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:37,644
You never...
Excuse me.

223
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,085
Come here. I would never
say this to her face,

224
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,622
but she is a wonderful
person and a gifted artist.

225
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,521
What? Why wouldn't you
say that to her face?

226
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:49,584
So, what do you think?
Think these guys are nice?

227
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,129
The guys I didn't bring
are even better.

228
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:55,793
Justin, I'm willing
to commit right now.

229
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,771
Would you
do me the honor

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,435
of spending the summer
with us at Dunder Mifflin?

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,375
I think you
are very special.

232
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:09,176
You didn't
want me before.

233
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:10,571
That's what
you said.

234
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,674
No, I didn't.

235
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:14,219
You misconstrued. You were
kind of a jerk to me.

236
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:16,585
I'm... And I'm going to go now.

237
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,283
Why don't... Hey.

238
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,340
Bless you.

239
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,418
Thank you.

240
00:14:54,393 --> 00:15:00,025
Okay, Jim, you owe me $120.
And, Phil, you owe me $230.

241
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,360
Let's open a tab, because you and me
are going to be playing more often.

242
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:06,132
Count me in.
Nope.

243
00:15:06,205 --> 00:15:07,832
All right.

244
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:12,037
Okay, you had some fun,
and I think I paid for it.

245
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:15,446
So let me just get
my last shot in there.

246
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,846
Is there anything
you can do for me?

247
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,076
I'll tell you what.

248
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:22,281
My fiscal year ends in two months.
Let's talk then.

249
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,652
Sound good?
Absolutely.

250
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:26,487
Good playing with you guys.
Right on.

251
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:32,588
You know, it's a tough thing,
seeing a grown man take six shots

252
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:36,965
to get out of the sand trap, but I had
to give Phil credit for not quitting.

253
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:38,867
Which is what I told him.

254
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,963
I also told him that
I don't quit, either.

255
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,806
And I'd call him every single day
until he gave me his business.

256
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:49,644
Which he then did, after fifteen
minutes of me blocking his car.

257
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:52,380
So I am now
his paper supplier.

258
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,083
And I shot a 102 today,
so I'm feeling pretty good.

259
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,752
The job fair will
be closing in five minutes.

260
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:04,626
Eighth period will
commence as scheduled.

261
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,596
Hold down the fort,
I have to do something.

262
00:16:18,344 --> 00:16:21,609
Excuse me.
If you can hear me,

263
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,946
I would like you to look
around at all these companies

264
00:16:25,017 --> 00:16:30,045
and know that none of them
are good enough for you.

265
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:32,716
H&R Block? Come on.

266
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:35,784
I mean, I don't even
know what they do.

267
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:39,992
Frank Regan Funeral Home?
Too much formaldehyde.

268
00:16:40,066 --> 00:16:41,590
The Air Force?

269
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,759
Air Force is cool.

270
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:50,275
The refreshments? Bush league, you know?
That's not what you want.

271
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:57,873
Dunder... Okay, I see security is coming, so
I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin.

272
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,180
Dunder Mifflin,
a great place to work.

273
00:17:00,253 --> 00:17:03,450
Anybody? Show of hands, anybody
want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?

274
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:07,549
We do not offer college credit, we
cannot give you any sort of pay,

275
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,095
but it is a really fun
work environment.

276
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:13,588
Anybody? Show of hands.

277
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,665
Damn it. Okay.

278
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:22,970
I'm going to wrap it up here.
Thank you for your time.

279
00:17:23,643 --> 00:17:24,871
And drive safe!

280
00:17:46,699 --> 00:17:48,792
Thank you.
You're welcome.

281
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:05,015
You realize
you are taking out.

282
00:18:07,353 --> 00:18:09,913
I can't...
Beers?

283
00:18:09,989 --> 00:18:12,287
You closed it?
I closed it.

284
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,757
Yes!

285
00:18:23,035 --> 00:18:24,093
Congratulations
to you, sir.

286
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,762
Thank you, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

287
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,238
Well done. Nice job. Thank you.

288
00:18:28,307 --> 00:18:30,332
You know what?
Screw this.

289
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:38,341
Today,
I did something stupid.

290
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,580
I questioned myself, and I
will never do that again.

291
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,554
Because I look at somebody
like Jim Halpert,

292
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:47,149
and I think that guy could
do anything he wants to do.

293
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:49,592
He could do anything,

294
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,462
and he chooses to work
here selling paper.

295
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,357
Just like me.

296
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,900
Yeah. Kiss her.
Kiss her good.

297
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,684
Hi.
Hello.

298
00:19:11,752 --> 00:19:14,516
I was just wondering, what
kind of jobs do you guys have?

299
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:16,078
Are you interested
in graphic design?

300
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,555
Yeah.

301
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,583
Can I fill out
an application?

302
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,754
Oh, absolutely.
Here, take a seat.

303
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,492
I should let you know right away that
this is just an entry-level job.

304
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:28,626
It's really basic. We're looking
for, like, a self starter,

305
00:19:28,702 --> 00:19:30,226
someone who can
meet deadlines

306
00:19:30,304 --> 00:19:31,737
and pretty much just
go the extra mile,

307
00:19:31,805 --> 00:19:33,033
I guess.
I can do that.

308
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:36,338
Great, and, obviously, we're looking
for someone who knows Photoshop,

309
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,042
and Dreamweaver, Corel Painter,
Illustrator, After Effects, all the basics.

310
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:44,482
I don't know
any of those.

311
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,712
It's actually not
super complicated.

312
00:19:46,787 --> 00:19:50,587
I mean, I'm sure there's some sort of
adult education classes in the area.

313
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:53,023
But if you're really serious
about graphic design,

314
00:19:53,093 --> 00:19:54,617
I would think about New
York or Philadelphia.

315
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,129
They've got amazing programs
out there for design.

316
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:58,323
New York
or Philadelphia.

317
00:19:58,398 --> 00:19:59,831
Yeah.

318
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,926
All right. Cool. Well, thanks.
Sure.

319
00:20:03,003 --> 00:20:04,903
And I'll look into those.
You should.

320
00:20:04,972 --> 00:20:06,439
New York or Philadelphia?
Absolutely.

321
00:20:06,507 --> 00:20:07,633
Okay. That's where
the action is.

322
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:08,902
Thanks.
