1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:04,970
Lords of the Ring trilogy, if you see it back
to back, it's really long, but it's good.

2
00:00:04,972 --> 00:00:06,105
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

3
00:00:06,107 --> 00:00:07,206
Pam! It's Michael.
Help me.

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:08,507
I need help right now.

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:09,675
Michael, what's wrong?

6
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:11,744
I'm hurt.
I have hurt myself!

7
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:13,445
- Ohh, my God!
- Okay, wait, wait, wait!

8
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,147
Oh, this is not
looking good, Pam!

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:16,915
Michael, do you need me
to call an ambulance?!

10
00:00:16,917 --> 00:00:18,617
No, I want you to pick me up.

11
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:20,052
- Ohh! - Okay.
- What's going on?

12
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:21,954
Wait a sec, I thought
you said that you were hurt.

13
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:23,022
I am hurt.
I hurt my foot.

14
00:00:23,024 --> 00:00:24,223
Pam, what's going on?

15
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,524
I want to come to work,

16
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,092
but I need you to
come and pick me up.

17
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,894
Ohh, God!

18
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,329
Hey, whoa!
Michael!

19
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,330
Oh, God!

20
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:32,898
It's okay.
It's Jim.

21
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,501
Just say again,
really loudly, what happened.

22
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:37,636
Okay. Buhh!
I burned my foot!

23
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,205
Very badly, on my Foreman Grill,

24
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,409
and I now need someone
to come and bring me into work.

25
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,879
You burned your foot
on a Foreman Grill?

26
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:48,447
I enjoy having breakfast in bed.

27
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:50,282
I like waking up
to the smell of bacon.

28
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:51,350
Sue me.

29
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,818
And since I don't have a butler,

30
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,219
I have to do it myself.

31
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,789
So most nights
before I go to bed,

32
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:00,692
I will lay six strips of bacon
out on my George Foreman Grill.

33
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:02,127
Then I go to sleep.

34
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:04,863
When I wake up,
I plug in the grill.

35
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:06,498
I go back to sleep again.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,469
Then I wake up to the smell
of crackling bacon.

37
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:12,838
It is delicious.
It's good for me.

38
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,873
It's a perfect way
to start the day.

39
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:18,010
Today I got up,
I stepped onto the grill,

40
00:01:18,012 --> 00:01:19,878
and it clamped down
on my foot, that's it.

41
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,848
I don't see what's
so hard to believe about that.

42
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,216
Pam, could you come get me?

43
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:27,219
Uh, I have to stay here
and answer the phone.

44
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,054
Okay, could someone come
and get me, please? Ryan?

45
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,190
Michael, you should
stay home and rest.

46
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:33,225
There's no toilet paper here.
Could Ryan...

47
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,827
Tell Ryan to bring toilet paper!

48
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:36,328
Could you tell him that?

49
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,396
Can you hop?

50
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,831
I tried hopping, Kevin,

51
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,366
and I bumped my elbow
against the wall,

52
00:01:41,368 --> 00:01:44,870
and now my elbow
has a "protruberence."

53
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,607
No one wants to pick me up?!

54
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,410
What is going on?

55
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:53,712
What is going on?

56
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:55,647
Michael is, um, sick,

57
00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:57,049
and he wants one of us
to rescue him.

58
00:01:57,051 --> 00:01:58,350
- I'm not sick, I'm...
- I'm coming, Michael!

59
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,119
I'm gonna save you!

60
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,187
Don't! Is that Dwight?
I do not want Dwight.

61
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,289
Hold on, Michael, I am coming!

62
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,390
- Wait there!
- I do not want Dwight!

63
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,427
Michael, why don't you
call your girlfriend?

64
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:09,728
I don't have a girlfriend.

65
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,263
But you said you went out
with her this weekend.

66
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,899
It was all made up.
Just... someone come, okay?

67
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:15,267
Anyone.
Anyone but Dwight.

68
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:21,540
- What was that?
- What was that?

69
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,375
Ohh.
Ohh!

70
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,843
He hit the pole.

71
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,180
It's broken, right?
He can't...

72
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:31,750
Oh, Dwight. Dwight.

73
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,118
Ohh!

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,787
Oh, my God. Oh, my gosh.
Is he okay?

75
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,357
He's still driving.

76
00:02:38,359 --> 00:02:40,492
Dwight...

77
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,694
You forgot your bumper!

78
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,062
Hello?

79
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,731
Please don't send Dwight.

80
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,036
Morning, everyone.

81
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,171
Don't freak out.

82
00:03:26,173 --> 00:03:28,207
I forbid anybody to freak out.

83
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,475
Clearly I have had
a very serious accident.

84
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:32,311
But I will recover.

85
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,779
God willing.

86
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,647
I just wanna be
treated normally today.

87
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:37,416
Normal would actually be good.

88
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:38,750
Considering the trauma
that I've been through.

89
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,052
You missed two big
conference calls today.

90
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,153
One with corporate.

91
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:44,456
Oh, did you
explain... why?

92
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:47,125
No, I didn't mention
that you cooked your foot.

93
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:48,393
Burned my foot, Pam.

94
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,831
Please stop popping my cast.

95
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,066
Thank you.

96
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:57,035
So where are you
shipping your foot?

97
00:03:57,037 --> 00:03:59,938
Ha ha ha.
So where are you shipping...

98
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,774
Your foot.

99
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,878
Thank you.

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,880
Pam, messages, please.

101
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:10,082
You didn't have any.

102
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:11,283
Really?

103
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:15,354
Well, seemed very important
to you earlier

104
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:17,222
that you needed to stay and...

105
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,957
- Do my job?
- No.

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,026
Your job is being
my friend, Pam... and...

107
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,228
Ow!
God!

108
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,396
It slipped.

109
00:04:24,398 --> 00:04:26,198
- What did...
- Sorry.

110
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,366
It's just that before, you said

111
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:28,500
you didn't want
any special treatment.

112
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,736
I don't want
any special treatment, Pam.

113
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:32,471
I just want you to treat me

114
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,539
like you would a family member

115
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,776
who's undergone some sort
of serious physical trauma.

116
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:39,811
I don't think that's
too much to ask.

117
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:41,580
Do you want some aspirin?
Because you seem a little fussy.

118
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,815
No, I don't want some aspirin.
Yeah, I am fussy.

119
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,384
Aspirin's not gonna
do a damn thing.

120
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:48,287
I'm sitting here with
a bloody stump of a foot.

121
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:50,622
Pam, I am
Assistant Regional Manager.

122
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:52,257
And I can take care of him.

123
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,926
Part of my duties are to...

124
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,601
What?

125
00:05:02,603 --> 00:05:03,969
Part of your duties are to what?

126
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,037
What?

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,073
You just said that part of
your duties are to something.

128
00:05:08,075 --> 00:05:09,641
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

129
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:10,742
What is wrong with you?

130
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,878
What is wrong with you?

131
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:27,859
Where is my cornbread?

132
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,161
Here you go.

133
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,196
Thank you. Did you get
all dark meat like I like?

134
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:33,365
Yes, I ordered three full
rotisserie chickens worth

135
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,900
of all dark meat.

136
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:35,901
Where are the yams?

137
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:36,902
They were out of yams.

138
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,236
I got you creamed spinach.

139
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,272
Did you go to the one
in Stroudsburg? Yes.

140
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:42,107
- And they had no yams?
- They had no yams.

141
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,408
How strange.

142
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,043
Because they always have yams.

143
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,715
Oh, man, is that
a Prism Duro Sport?

144
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,316
You've seen one of these?

145
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,052
Yeah, they're like an iPod,
only they're better.

146
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,588
'Cause they're chunkier
and more solid.

147
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:57,856
Roy gave it to me for Christmas.

148
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,624
I'm trying to figure out
how to put songs on it.

149
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,194
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

150
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:03,995
I know this Russian website

151
00:06:03,997 --> 00:06:06,765
where you can download songs
for two cents apiece.

152
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:09,935
Really? Yeah, I'll write
down the address for you.

153
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:12,170
Only the only thing is...

154
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:15,374
is that all the songs
are in Russian.

155
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,677
Kidding!

156
00:06:19,812 --> 00:06:21,079
Oh... oh!

157
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:23,782
Why would they all be...

158
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,820
Okay, see you later, Pan.

159
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,260
Pan?

160
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,095
Pam!

161
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:39,064
Pam?

162
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:41,500
Oh, God.

163
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,170
What?

164
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,671
Come here, please.

165
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,974
Tell me before I come there.

166
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:51,109
I want you
to rub butter on my foot.

167
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:52,110
No.

168
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,278
Pam, please.

169
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,379
I have Country Crock.

170
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:55,480
No.

171
00:07:00,354 --> 00:07:02,654
Ryan!

172
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,556
Ryan!

173
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:06,491
Ryan!

174
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:08,360
These covers...

175
00:07:08,362 --> 00:07:10,095
are totally indestructible.

176
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,263
Really?
Yeah.

177
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,865
Throw it.
I promise it won't break.

178
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:15,033
Chuck it.

179
00:07:20,206 --> 00:07:21,907
Oh, no, it's broken.

180
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:23,008
What?

181
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,576
No, it's fine.

182
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:25,877
I told you it wouldn't break.

183
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,345
You could throw it all day long.

184
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:28,613
That is so cool.

185
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,715
Thanks, Dwight.

186
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,150
You're welcome.

187
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,354
So I guess Pam and Dwight
are friends now.

188
00:07:36,989 --> 00:07:37,989
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

189
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,058
Oh, God, no.
Dwight isn't my friend.

190
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,363
Oh, my God...
Dwight's kind of my friend!

191
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:49,534
No, no... no one is helping me
out at all, Mom.

192
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,904
No, I'm not gonna call Jan.

193
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:54,039
She'd just worry.

194
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,274
Drive down here
and make a big thing.

195
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,478
Who told you that?

196
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,514
No, it was mutual.

197
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,750
What is Pam doing
chatting with you?

198
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:15,160
Hmm.
Do you like candy?

199
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,162
It's all right.

200
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,865
'Cause you're
sweeter than candy.

201
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,666
What is wrong with you?

202
00:08:23,636 --> 00:08:25,770
Hey, cut...

203
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,400
Wow, you just dive right in.

204
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,002
You know, around age 12,

205
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:58,236
I just started
going for it, you know?

206
00:08:58,238 --> 00:08:59,237
Help!

207
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:04,809
Oh, help! Help me!

208
00:09:04,811 --> 00:09:06,511
What... what happened?

209
00:09:06,513 --> 00:09:08,179
I fell off the toilet.

210
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:11,883
I'm caught between
the toilet and the wall.

211
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,152
What do you need?

212
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:16,087
Not you.
Someone else.

213
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,689
Get Pam.

214
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:19,491
I don't think Pam's gonna wanna
come into the men's room.

215
00:09:19,493 --> 00:09:20,859
Get Ryan.

216
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,661
He needs to lift me!

217
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:24,596
And he needs to
clean me up a little bit.

218
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,464
Bring a wet towel.

219
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,968
Ryan is, uh... dead.

220
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,003
No, he's not.
I just saw him.

221
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,572
No. He's...

222
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,307
Can you just get up yourself?

223
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,742
I... you only
grilled your foot.

224
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,578
Oh, forget it.

225
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,313
I'll just get up myself.

226
00:09:41,315 --> 00:09:42,948
Ohh! Oww!

227
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:47,986
Ow! Ow, God!

228
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,557
Do you think Dwight's
being a little weird today?

229
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,394
No... he's actually been
really nice and helpful.

230
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:58,029
And that isn't weird?

231
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,166
Well...

232
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,070
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

233
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,372
Phyllis... Oscar...

234
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:09,808
Ryan, who is supposed
to be dead.

235
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:13,011
Can I ask you all a question?

236
00:10:13,013 --> 00:10:15,580
Do you know what it's like
to be disabled?

237
00:10:15,582 --> 00:10:18,883
Um... I had scoliosis
as a girl.

238
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,020
Never heard of it.
No... a real disability.

239
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23,254
Not a woman's trouble.

240
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,457
When I was a teenager,
I was in an iron lung.

241
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,492
Wha... how old are you?

242
00:10:27,494 --> 00:10:31,463
No, it...
Look, the point is...

243
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:36,368
I am the only one here
who has a legitimate disability.

244
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:41,039
Although I'm sure Stanley has
had his fair share of obstacles.

245
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,875
I'm not disabled,
and neither are you.

246
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:48,246
Okay, what does this look like
to you, Stanley?

247
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:50,382
Mail Boxes, Etc.

248
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:52,584
Shut... it.

249
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,552
Okay.
Well...

250
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,388
Well, you know what?

251
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,056
Disabilities

252
00:10:58,058 --> 00:11:00,291
are not things to be laughed at

253
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,293
or laughed about.

254
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:04,129
You people are jerks.

255
00:11:04,131 --> 00:11:07,032
Imagine if you had
left Stevie Wonder

256
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,234
on the floor of that bathroom
instead of me.

257
00:11:09,236 --> 00:11:11,536
Oh, we wouldn't.
We love Stevie Wonder.

258
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:16,808
I burned my foot!

259
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,445
Okay, 20 minutes,
conference room.

260
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,213
Everybody's in there!

261
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,116
Dad?

262
00:11:29,121 --> 00:11:30,555
While we are waiting

263
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,857
for our special guests
to arrive,

264
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,793
I wanted you all to take a look

265
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:38,797
at a few of the many,
many disabled icons

266
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,899
who have contributed
so much to our society.

267
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,200
Quick question.
Yeah?

268
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,602
Why is Tom Hanks on the wall?

269
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,571
- Twice.
- Good question.

270
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,541
Forrest Gump,
mentally challenged.

271
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:52,010
Philadelphia...
AIDS.

272
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,778
I think that's from Big.

273
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,114
I don't think so, no.

274
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,717
Yeah, he's dancing on a piano
with Robert Loggia.

275
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,819
He grew into a man overnight.

276
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,754
A rare disability.
It still works.

277
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,624
A crossword puzzle, Stanley?

278
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,827
Seriously, are you learning
nothing here?

279
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:09,861
Mm-hmm.

280
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,863
What do you mean,
"Mm-hmm"?

281
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:12,897
I mean I'm learning nothing.

282
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:13,932
Okay.

283
00:12:13,934 --> 00:12:15,400
Michael Scott.
I'm looking for Michael Scott.

284
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,102
Yes, right in here.

285
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:18,503
- Good.
- Come on in.

286
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:19,704
Great.

287
00:12:19,706 --> 00:12:23,575
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is our special guest.

288
00:12:23,577 --> 00:12:24,843
Sorry I'm late.

289
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:28,213
Somebody parked in
the handicapped parking space.

290
00:12:28,215 --> 00:12:29,414
Oh.

291
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,416
Hey, everyone.
I'm Billy Merchant.

292
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,017
You may have seen me
around here before.

293
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,887
I'm the properties manager
of this office park.

294
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,222
You are so brave.

295
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,456
You are so brave.

296
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,991
Thank you.

297
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:41,860
Actually, I've been meaning to
come by here for a long time...

298
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:42,961
But it's hard for you, right?

299
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,662
Because you're in a wheelchair.

300
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,031
No, I just have a lot
of properties to manage.

301
00:12:47,033 --> 00:12:48,800
Let me ask you something.

302
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,302
How long does it take
for you to do something simple?

303
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,005
Every day, like... like brush
your teeth in the morning.

304
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:56,241
I don't know, like, 30 seconds.

305
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:57,475
Oh, my God.

306
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,577
That's three times
as long as it takes me.

307
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:01,980
How did you

308
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:03,248
get in your wheelchair?

309
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,582
This morning?

310
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,984
Just like every other morning.
Just climbed on in.

311
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,387
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Not funny, not funny!

312
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,356
Hey, hey, relax just, uh...

313
00:13:11,358 --> 00:13:12,624
joking around here.

314
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:13,658
Well, that's good.

315
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,493
He still has a sense of humor.

316
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:16,895
Listen, I've actually
used a chair

317
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:18,663
since I was four years old.

318
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,964
I don't really
notice it anymore.

319
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,032
Well, they do.
They notice it.

320
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,667
Don't you?
You notice it.

321
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,802
It's the first thing you saw

322
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:25,804
when he rolled in here,
isn't it?

323
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:29,574
I wanna clamp Michael's face
in a George Foreman Grill.

324
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:30,842
So there are just
a couple things

325
00:13:30,844 --> 00:13:31,876
I wanted to remind everybody of.

326
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,078
First is parking.

327
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,513
You can't block
the freight entrance

328
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:37,348
with your car,
even if your blinkers are on.

329
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,518
Does anybody have any questions?

330
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,586
Yes?

331
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:43,788
Yeah?

332
00:13:44,957 --> 00:13:46,024
Yes?

333
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,159
Dwight, you have your hand up.

334
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,464
Ignore him.

335
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:54,933
You know what?

336
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:55,934
We're not that different,

337
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:56,968
you and I.

338
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:57,969
When I clamped

339
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,238
my foot
into a non-stick...

340
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,506
You know what, Michael? Yeah?

341
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,976
Let me stop you right there,
and leave.

342
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:07,879
Did you see
Born on the Fourth of July?

343
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,647
I was under the impression
that Billy would be

344
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:11,082
more like that guy.

345
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:12,483
What's wrong with that guy?

346
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:13,885
You mean today?

347
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,987
He stepped on a George Foreman
Grill and he burned his foot.

348
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,322
No, not Michael.

349
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,858
The moon-faced kid
who crashed into the pole.

350
00:14:22,094 --> 00:14:24,929
He looks like
he has a concussion.

351
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:29,734
Hey!

352
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,469
I found the pudding cups
you wanted

353
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:33,605
at a gas station in Carbondale!

354
00:14:33,607 --> 00:14:35,907
You did it.
Look at you.

355
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,243
And with the plate
and the napkin.

356
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,844
Very nice.
Thank you, Ryan.

357
00:14:39,846 --> 00:14:41,746
- You're very welcome.
- Did you get the yams?

358
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:43,848
No, the gas station
in Carbondale

359
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,516
did not have fresh yams.

360
00:14:45,518 --> 00:14:47,418
Okay.

361
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,553
I'll just have the pudding.

362
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:49,721
- You sure?
- Yeah.

363
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:50,755
Okay.

364
00:14:50,757 --> 00:14:52,957
You know what?
I feel better.

365
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:54,759
Ryan brought me
some chocolate pudding,

366
00:14:54,761 --> 00:14:57,462
and his kindness healed my foot.

367
00:14:57,464 --> 00:15:00,031
Yeah, baby!

368
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,733
I am feelin' better.

369
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,101
My body's literally

370
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,936
healing itself.

371
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,938
It is amazing what
the human body is capable of

372
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,506
when you have a powerful brain.

373
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:11,809
I ground up
four extra-strength aspirin

374
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,745
and put them
in Michael's pudding.

375
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,179
I do the same thing with my dog

376
00:15:15,181 --> 00:15:18,182
to get him to take
his heartworm medicine.

377
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:22,287
Ohh, finally feel the blood
coursing through my foot veins.

378
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:23,454
Ohh!

379
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:26,724
Oh! Okay, I think
we need to take him

380
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,359
to the hospital, because...

381
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,028
I'm pretty sure
he has a concussion.

382
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,462
Oh, now you feel

383
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:32,730
some compassion for him.

384
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:33,798
He needs to go right now.

385
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,133
And you're his
emergency contact.

386
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,200
I think you should go with him.

387
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,368
Why don't you go with him?

388
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,537
- I... barely know him.
- I want Michael to take me.

389
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,339
I can't take you.
I don't have my car.

390
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:43,107
- Please?
- And yours is all vomity.

391
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:44,375
You can take my van!

392
00:15:44,377 --> 00:15:45,877
Oh, okay.
That's great.

393
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,812
No, I can't drive.
Jim, why don't you drive?

394
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:50,548
Fine. We'll go. I'm
still recovering.

395
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,817
So let's just... Ryan,
can you get my coat, please?

396
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:54,585
Slowly. Let's just
get to the elevator.

397
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:56,220
What are you doing?

398
00:15:56,222 --> 00:15:57,922
Vietnam sounds.

399
00:15:57,924 --> 00:15:59,624
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

400
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:02,126
Tired.
Can't lay down.

401
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,428
- Just take a rake...
- Wake up!

402
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,063
Ahh! Wait, here, let
me help you, Dwight.

403
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,264
Come on.
Get up.

404
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,332
Thanks.
Get up.

405
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,733
- You're the best.
- Yeah.

406
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,034
It smells like chicken soup.

407
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:11,069
I know.

408
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,403
I have to go to the hospital.

409
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,572
I know.
Where are we going?

410
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:16,107
I just wanna
say good-bye, okay?

411
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:17,508
- I'll be back, I mean...
- Yes, I know.

412
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,609
But it's gonna be different.

413
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,610
Why?

414
00:16:19,612 --> 00:16:21,412
It's just hard to explain.

415
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,448
Oh, Pam, you're adorable.

416
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,583
Oh, my goodness.

417
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,751
Come here.

418
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,720
Ohh.
Huggy hugs.

419
00:16:28,722 --> 00:16:30,788
Shotgun!

420
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,324
You don't think you should
sit in the back with Dwight?

421
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,961
The rules of shotgun
are very simple and very clear.

422
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,364
The first person
to shout shotgun

423
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:41,132
when you're within
the sight of the car

424
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:42,700
gets the front seat.

425
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,302
That's how the game's played.

426
00:16:44,304 --> 00:16:47,005
There are no exceptions
for someone with a concussion.

427
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,340
Oh, God, a minivan.

428
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,609
What is Meredith's problem?

429
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,244
Well, I think she has a kid.

430
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,013
Yeah, she has one kid
and no husband.

431
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:57,382
She's not gonna find one
driving this thing around.

432
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:58,483
Where are we going?

433
00:16:58,485 --> 00:16:59,550
Come on.

434
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,952
- Get inside.
- Where are we going?

435
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,754
We're going
to Chuck E. Cheese.

436
00:17:02,756 --> 00:17:03,855
Chuck E. Cheese?
Oh, God.

437
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,923
I'm so sick
of Chuck E. Cheese.

438
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:07,725
We're going to the hospital,
Michael.

439
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:09,927
I know.
I'm just sayin'...

440
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:13,331
Dwight, what are you drinking?

441
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,399
I found it under the seat.

442
00:17:14,401 --> 00:17:15,967
Oh, my God.
Dwight.

443
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,001
Put that down.
I'm thirsty.

444
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,169
Noo! Give the bottle to Michael.

445
00:17:18,171 --> 00:17:19,470
Noo! Just give the
bottle to Michael.

446
00:17:19,472 --> 00:17:20,738
- Just give it to me...
- I'm thirsty!

447
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,106
Just keep your eyes on the road.

448
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,708
Give me the bottle,
or you're fired!

449
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,576
You can't fire me.
I don't work in this van.

450
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,711
Give it to me, Dwight!

451
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,812
- No, stop.
- Give me the bottle!

452
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:29,881
- Will you stop?
- Give me the bottle, Dwight!

453
00:17:29,883 --> 00:17:31,149
- Michael, stop!
- Just give it!

454
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,617
- Michael, stop!
- Just... stop it!

455
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,819
Stop spraying!
Give me the bottle!

456
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:36,521
- Stop!
- Stop spraying me!

457
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,822
Give me the bottle!

458
00:17:37,824 --> 00:17:39,957
Dwight, what is
your middle name?

459
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:42,260
Danger.

460
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:43,828
Something with a "K."

461
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,329
It's Kurt.

462
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:47,331
Wow, I'm so sad
that I know that.

463
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:50,435
What do I write under
reason for visit?

464
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,103
Concussion.

465
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:55,573
What did you write?

466
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:58,242
Ahem, nothing.

467
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,012
I wrote "bringing someone
to the hospital."

468
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:02,413
So you thought they meant
your reason

469
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:03,414
for coming to the hospital.

470
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:04,582
No, no.
You know what, Jim?

471
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:06,851
This isn't about me anymore.

472
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:08,786
I made a miraculous recovery,

473
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:10,588
which is more than
I can say for him.

474
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,656
Come on, Dwight.

475
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:14,492
Hi, Michael.

476
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,294
Hi, Dwight.

477
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,762
Ahh.

478
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,464
Uhh.

479
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:21,833
Doctor, what is more serious,

480
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:23,768
a head injury or a foot injury?

481
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,103
A head injury.

482
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,404
Well, you don't
have all the information.

483
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,005
The foot has been
fairly severely burned,

484
00:18:28,007 --> 00:18:29,941
and, uh, healed quickly.

485
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,008
Very quickly.

486
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,044
Actually, like,
suspiciously quickly.

487
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,879
So I'm ordering a CAT scan.

488
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,647
What is that?

489
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,584
Look, since you have
the machine up and running,

490
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:40,852
can I just stick my foot in?

491
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:42,420
- We can take a look.
- Well...

492
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,721
For a burn, you really just need

493
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:45,156
to look at the outside
of the foot.

494
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:47,058
Okay, what kind
of machine is that?

495
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,093
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

496
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,561
That's what she said.

497
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:53,197
That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

498
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,468
Okay, no electronics
past this point.

499
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,703
Camera, sound equipment.

500
00:18:58,705 --> 00:18:59,704
It's okay, they're with me.

501
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,939
No metal of any kind.

502
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,609
All right, well, I guess
this is where we leave you off.

503
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:05,710
I don't wanna do this.

504
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:07,145
Uh, well, you should have
thought of that

505
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:09,981
before you crashed your head
on your way to pick me up, so...

506
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:13,417
We'll... see you
when you get out.

507
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:14,685
Oh.

508
00:19:18,357 --> 00:19:20,525
Fine. Fine.

509
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,106
Dunder Mifflin.
This is Pam.

510
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,507
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim.

511
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,442
Oh, my God, what's going on?

512
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,510
Is Dwight okay?

513
00:19:39,512 --> 00:19:40,678
Mm-hmm,
he should be fine.

514
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,613
But they brought him in
for a CAT scan.

515
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:44,749
I can't believe he's
getting a CAT scan.

516
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,117
Michael went in there
with him too.

517
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,518
It's pretty sweet.

518
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,054
Really? Michael went in
with him? Wow.

519
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:51,322
But they shouldn't
be much longer now.

520
00:19:51,324 --> 00:19:52,490
So we'll be back soon.

521
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,292
Okay, that's... good news.

522
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:57,762
Um, uh, yeah, no.
I'll let you go.

523
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,763
Okay. Bye.

524
00:19:58,765 --> 00:20:00,231
Bye.

525
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:08,239
Hey, Oscar?

526
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,307
What's up, Pam?

527
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:10,841
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

528
00:20:10,843 --> 00:20:12,243
that Dwight's gonna be okay.

529
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,078
The doctor said there's
a really simple treatment

530
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,347
for a concussion,
so he'll probably even

531
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:17,815
be back at work tomorrow.

532
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,250
Okay.

533
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:21,686
I just, uh, thought
you'd wanna know that.

534
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:27,592
Okay, Mr. Schrute.

535
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:28,626
Inhale with me

536
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,627
on three.

537
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,596
One, two...

538
00:20:31,598 --> 00:20:33,264
Sir, stop that.

539
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,066
Stop...

540
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:37,134
Stop that.
