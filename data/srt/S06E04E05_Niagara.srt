1
00:00:01,701 --> 00:00:03,191
I'm sorry, you guys
have probably noticed

2
00:00:03,269 --> 00:00:05,897
my stomach's a little
more sensitive lately.

3
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:09,237
So, if you wouldn't mind
wearing a little less perfume.

4
00:00:09,308 --> 00:00:11,276
And if your lunch
is especially pungent,

5
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,107
maybe have it
in the break room.

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:14,578
We would really
appreciate it.

7
00:00:14,647 --> 00:00:17,673
Pam is constantly throwing up
because of the pregnancy.

8
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,584
<i>If she eats something the fetus
doesn't like, she is screwed.</i>

9
00:00:21,654 --> 00:00:25,750
It's amazing, a three-ounce
fetus is calling the shots.

10
00:00:26,425 --> 00:00:28,222
It's so badass.

11
00:00:28,794 --> 00:00:31,786
Phyllis, if you could
switch to a different soap,

12
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,958
just for a month or two.
Yours is kind of perfumey.

13
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:36,763
Now this is getting
ridiculous.

14
00:00:36,836 --> 00:00:39,600
Oh, gee. I'm sorry. I
guess I missed the meeting

15
00:00:39,672 --> 00:00:42,072
where we all voted
for you to get pregnant.

16
00:00:42,775 --> 00:00:47,735
No. I reserve the right to peel
my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.

17
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:50,441
All morning I look forward
to my afternoon cigars.

18
00:00:50,516 --> 00:00:52,643
And I am not stopping
for anybody.

19
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:55,076
I don't think I'm asking for too much.

20
00:00:55,154 --> 00:00:58,555
I guess it's just the end
of courtesy in the workplace.

21
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:20,637
Watching people get sick
always makes me sick.

22
00:01:20,713 --> 00:01:25,980
And, frankly, so does
talking about it. So, wow.

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,922
Well, what
do you think?

24
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:13,431
I spent all morning doing it.

25
00:02:13,499 --> 00:02:15,262
It is really
special.

26
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:19,561
Yeah, but aren't you supposed to
do that to our... No. It's great.

27
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,767
Well, it's just a really
important day for me.

28
00:02:22,842 --> 00:02:24,742
Well, congrats.
Thanks.

29
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,774
Dunder Mifflin Scranton will
be closed today and Friday

30
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,578
for a company wedding
in Niagara Falls.

31
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,950
So please leave a message and we'll
get back to you as soon as possible.

32
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,716
Have a great day.

33
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:40,452
Believe it or not, Kevin,
firecrackers are in the "Don't" column.

34
00:02:40,526 --> 00:02:42,585
So, you're going to
provide them, then?

35
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,254
No, this is a firecracker-free wedding.

36
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,195
What the hell? You've
got to be kidding me.

37
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:48,324
Okay, all of these things
are important to remember,

38
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,732
but the most
important thing

39
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,064
is that no one
say anything

40
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:52,661
about my pregnancy
at the wedding.

41
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,433
Absolutely. Because not everyone knows

42
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:55,804
and some people
might be offended.

43
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,036
Decent people everywhere
will get offended.

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,738
Well, we're thinking of my
grandmother, who we haven't told

45
00:03:00,813 --> 00:03:02,110
and who is very
old-fashioned.

46
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,274
Well, you're lucky
to have a grandmother.

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,341
Some of us have to be
our own grandmother.

48
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:09,718
You know, Angela, you don't
have to come to the wedding.

49
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,256
Really, Pam? Yes, she
does. Yes, she does.

50
00:03:11,323 --> 00:03:12,915
We're all going to go and
we're going to have a good time.

51
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,926
Ow! He pinched me.
No.

52
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,929
Next time we're all in this
room, Jim and I will be married.

53
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:19,021
We'll see.

54
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,087
Thank you,
Dwight.

55
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,326
Goodbye.
See you later.

56
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,424
Bye.
Bye.

57
00:03:22,501 --> 00:03:26,164
Hey, and don't embarrass me
when we go to Niagara.

58
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,769
What happens in Niagara
stays in Niagara.

59
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:35,210
Don't, don't, don't. You stole
my joke. Don't steal my joke.

60
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,714
No, I didn't
steal your joke.

61
00:03:36,782 --> 00:03:38,147
Yes, I said
that yesterday.

62
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,548
But you can say that
about anything.

63
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,280
What happens in Accounting
stays in Accounting.

64
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:43,412
Oh, yeah!

65
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,957
No, no, no, no. Please,
please. Dwight, that's my joke.

66
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:48,016
Yeah, but it's so easy. That's
what I'm saying. You can say...

67
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:49,755
No, okay. This is what
I am talking about.

68
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:53,959
When we leave here and
go up to Niagara Falls,

69
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,332
we are representing
Dunder Mifflin, everyone.

70
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,564
This is a very important
wedding for this branch.

71
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:01,265
The most important wedding
until I get married.

72
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,399
So I want you all
on your best behavior,

73
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,670
or so help me God...

74
00:04:06,612 --> 00:04:10,571
So I will see you
up there in Viagra Falls.

75
00:04:13,452 --> 00:04:17,218
Pam and Jim's wedding will be
the single best pickup destination

76
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:19,780
in the history
of the universe.

77
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,384
I stole the guest list
from Jim's desk,

78
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:26,261
and I search-engined every female
on both sides of the family.

79
00:04:26,332 --> 00:04:27,856
Get out of here.
Yes.

80
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,298
Oh, my God, Dwight.

81
00:04:29,368 --> 00:04:33,464
For instance, Pam's
cousin, Jocelyn Webster.

82
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,836
There's a name.

83
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:39,272
Two years ago, she was
selling a mountain bike.

84
00:04:39,345 --> 00:04:40,812
Oh! Well, tell me
about Jocelyn.

85
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,904
Yes.

86
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,039
What's she like?
I will, I will.

87
00:04:43,115 --> 00:04:47,108
Well, she's really into mountain
biking. But not so much lately.

88
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,210
Okay.

89
00:04:48,287 --> 00:04:50,881
She had a couple
hundred dollars to spend.

90
00:04:50,956 --> 00:04:53,925
I mean, if she was able
to sell her bike.

91
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:57,420
Is that all
you have on her?

92
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,987
Well, if this is in fact her,
because it's a very common name.

93
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:01,589
Okay,
you're an idiot.

94
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:14,645
People don't think of me as one of
the sharper dressers in the office,

95
00:05:14,713 --> 00:05:17,739
but I'm going to turn that
around at this wedding.

96
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,850
<i>I thought, "How can I
take it to the next level?"</i>

97
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,722
The hair.

98
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:27,825
It's the hair.

99
00:05:27,893 --> 00:05:30,657
Okay, okay!
I'm going.

100
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,256
God!

101
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:37,598
Hey, do one of you guys
want to sit up front with me

102
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,297
so I have someone
to talk to?

103
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:42,101
It's like a five-hour
drive-ish, you know.

104
00:05:42,174 --> 00:05:43,641
Nah, this is
so much cooler.

105
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,506
We feel like we're in a
limo and you're our driver.

106
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:46,670
Hmm.

107
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:48,805
Erin?

108
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:52,612
Oh, no. That wouldn't be fair
to leave Kelly alone in the back.

109
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,579
Not only is Erin really sweet
and cute, she smells like my mom.

110
00:06:00,259 --> 00:06:02,227
Hey, my aunt told me
something neat. Yeah?

111
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:04,956
She said everything with
the wedding goes by so fast,

112
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,726
we should try to take mental
pictures of the high points.

113
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,233
Oh. Wow.
That's cool.

114
00:06:09,301 --> 00:06:10,393
Yeah.

115
00:06:11,103 --> 00:06:12,297
Click.

116
00:06:12,671 --> 00:06:15,640
You blinked. Damn it, now
that's in my brain forever.

117
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:16,732
Oh!

118
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,140
Lousy picture!

119
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,543
We should have hired a professional
to take the mental pictures.

120
00:06:26,952 --> 00:06:28,817
Oh, God, wow.

121
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:31,518
Oh! I was asleep.

122
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:32,682
What? No way.

123
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:34,157
Those glasses
are super dark.

124
00:06:34,226 --> 00:06:35,250
Oh. Wow.

125
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:38,819
Okay. All right, we
need some tunes, I think.

126
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,331
You know what,
I made you a CD.

127
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,094
You did? That was nice of you. Mmm-hmm.

128
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,465
This is to play when you bring
a woman back to your hotel room.

129
00:06:44,536 --> 00:06:47,699
Oh! Very thoughtful. A
little mix to set the mood.

130
00:06:48,073 --> 00:06:49,665
Delightful.
Pop that in.

131
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,232
You're going to
like this.

132
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,143
<i>Hello. My name
is Dwight Schrute.</i>

133
00:06:54,213 --> 00:06:55,510
<i>If you are listening to this,</i>

134
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,209
<i>you are a lucky woman
Michael has seduced.</i>

135
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,343
<i>Ah! To be in your shoes!</i>

136
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,985
<i>"What's next?"
You're probably wondering.</i>

137
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:06,047
<i>Don't be scared of
your night in heaven.</i>

138
00:07:06,325 --> 00:07:07,349
Are you serious?

139
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,894
You want me to play that for
a woman coming to my room?

140
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,759
Yeah. It's practical.
My God.

141
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,888
No, no.
It's...

142
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,592
That's not
how it works.

143
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:18,603
<i>Niagara Falls used to be, like,
a spiritual experience to people.</i>

144
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,606
<i>They stayed in tents
and it blew their minds.</i>

145
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:25,206
<i>But it's really kitschy now,
which is a lot of fun.</i>

146
00:07:26,011 --> 00:07:27,501
Halpert. Halpert.

147
00:07:27,579 --> 00:07:28,603
And Beesly.

148
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,807
Tonight we're in
two separate rooms

149
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:32,077
and then tomorrow night
is the honeymoon suite.

150
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,140
Great.

151
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,845
I know, we're pretty excited, too.

152
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,547
Can we take a look
at the suite now?

153
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,522
I'm sorry.
Somebody just checked in.

154
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,956
Is there another wedding
at the hotel this weekend?

155
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:43,859
Oh, no. Just an
individual. That man there.

156
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,921
Hey, I got the room
the night before you guys.

157
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:48,227
I'll break in the bed.

158
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:53,199
I don't like that.

159
00:07:53,272 --> 00:07:54,705
I'm going to need the
name and cell phone number

160
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:57,571
of the housekeeper responsible
for changing the sheets, please.

161
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:01,413
Hello, reservation
for Michael Scott.

162
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,674
One moment
while I check.

163
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,581
Their proximity to the falls makes
everything smell like a basement.

164
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:06,640
Mmm-hmm.

165
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:08,914
I'm sorry, sir. I'm
not seeing you in here.

166
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:10,615
When did you make
your reservation?

167
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:12,088
I don't have
a reservation,

168
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:15,183
but I want a room in the
Beesly-Halpert block of rooms.

169
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,991
Oh! Okay. Unfortunately, sir, the
block only applies to the rate.

170
00:08:19,064 --> 00:08:20,691
I'm afraid
we're all sold out.

171
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:23,394
Dwight Schrute.
I have a reservation.

172
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:29,835
Confirmation number,
Romeo-Tango-G-seven- seven-four-five.

173
00:08:29,908 --> 00:08:31,102
Yes. Schrute.

174
00:08:31,176 --> 00:08:34,771
And I had spoken to Teresa
about a room with two safes.

175
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,576
Sure, no problem.
- Okay.

176
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:37,876
There's your key, Mr.
Schrute. Well, good.

177
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,939
Thank you.

178
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,451
Dwight. Dwight,
Dwight, Dwight.

179
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:41,543
I need to stay
in your room.

180
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,609
No way. What if
I meet someone?

181
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,053
I'm staying in your...
Come on, Dwight.

182
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:45,249
No. Michael. I would
do the same for you.

183
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:46,348
You would?
Yes.

184
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:48,359
Really?
Yes. Let's just go.

185
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:52,295
Wait a second. No, no, no. This
must be some kind of mistake.

186
00:08:52,364 --> 00:08:54,298
This reservation
is under an M. Scott.

187
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,663
Oh!
This must be yours.

188
00:08:55,734 --> 00:08:57,065
Thank God.

189
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:59,934
Oh, no. Now that I don't have
a room, can I stay with you?

190
00:09:00,005 --> 00:09:01,097
Um...

191
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:06,204
No. You know what, I would
say yes, but you can't.

192
00:09:06,278 --> 00:09:07,336
And I'll tell you why.

193
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:08,402
Please.

194
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,674
If I have
a woman up there

195
00:09:09,748 --> 00:09:11,045
and things are
getting amorous,

196
00:09:11,116 --> 00:09:13,550
she's going to get turned off
if she looks in the bathroom

197
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:16,588
and she sees you brushing your
teeth with butter and clay, okay?

198
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:19,818
Okay, okay. Ah, ha-ha! That
was a test and you have failed

199
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,122
for this is
my room, okay?

200
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,128
You would not share with
me. I don't have a room?

201
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,754
No, you do not.
Okay.

202
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,867
Ooh! You must
pass the dungeon wisdom test.

203
00:09:28,934 --> 00:09:30,026
Jerk.
It worked.

204
00:09:30,102 --> 00:09:34,732
When Mary was denied a room
at the inn, Jesus was born.

205
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,004
When Michael was denied
a room at the inn,

206
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:42,639
we don't know what happens because
that story hasn't been told yet.

207
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:46,744
Mr. And Mrs. Stanley Hudson.

208
00:09:47,352 --> 00:09:51,413
Hey, Stanley, favor. Could
I stay in your room tonight?

209
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,890
Are you out of your mind?
I brought Cynthia with me.

210
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:55,688
Not in the same bed.
In the other bed.

211
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,661
I got one queen-sized bed.

212
00:09:57,729 --> 00:09:59,822
You are kidding me.

213
00:10:00,165 --> 00:10:02,531
A queen-sized bed
is five feet wide.

214
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,761
I am not five feet
wide, Michael.

215
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:07,067
I'm not a physics major, Stanley.
I'm just saying, be careful.

216
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:10,404
Hey, guys. Hey, could I
stay in your room tonight?

217
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:12,103
Oh, gross.
Blow my brains out.

218
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:13,610
That's rude.

219
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,746
Michael, I have an extra
twin bed if you want.

220
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:19,648
You are going to be sleeping by
yourself for the rest of your life,

221
00:10:19,718 --> 00:10:22,186
so you should
just get used to it.

222
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:26,248
So, which one
is Pam's grandma?

223
00:10:26,758 --> 00:10:29,659
Oh, Meemaw? She's the
one in the teal suit.

224
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:32,356
She's the only 80-year-old
with no smile wrinkles.

225
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:35,195
Dad, remember, no mention
of the baby, right?

226
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,256
No.

227
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,859
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
she's very conservative.

228
00:10:38,003 --> 00:10:39,800
So, mum's the word.

229
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:41,840
Mom, Dad, this is Michael
Scott. How you doing?

230
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:42,931
Hi.
Nice to meet you.

231
00:10:43,008 --> 00:10:44,703
Nice to meet you.
Who's doing a toast?

232
00:10:44,776 --> 00:10:46,641
I would like to go third,
sort of bat cleanup if...

233
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:48,509
Michael, I thought
we discussed

234
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,208
that we'd rather you
not speak, like, at all.

235
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:53,717
Because it's just going to
be blood relatives, I think.

236
00:10:53,785 --> 00:10:55,776
That is seriously going
to impede my ability

237
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:58,118
to hook up with
your female relatives.

238
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:00,620
Pretty sure
everybody heard that.

239
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,159
Didn't move my lips.

240
00:11:05,764 --> 00:11:07,197
Hey, Meemaw.

241
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:11,430
I wasn't sure about
your branch of the family

242
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,735
after I heard about
your parents' divorce.

243
00:11:15,073 --> 00:11:19,237
But you and Jim
are just perfect.

244
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,503
God bless you.

245
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,413
Thank you,
but nobody's perfect.

246
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,444
Well, I wouldn't care to
live if I thought that.

247
00:11:31,623 --> 00:11:32,715
Mr. Beesly,
how are you?

248
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,759
I'd like you to meet Kristy Kelly.

249
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,158
Oh! Is this
your niece?

250
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,324
No, no. She's my girlfriend. Hey,
can you make room at the head table?

251
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:46,530
From quarter three
to quarter four, up 17%.

252
00:11:46,805 --> 00:11:50,901
While his sales, down 2%.
It's all there in the report.

253
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:52,637
Why would they make
the bad man your boss

254
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:53,769
if you're
so much smarter?

255
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:56,837
Excellent question.
Because while I was busy

256
00:11:56,915 --> 00:12:00,578
trying to improve the company
and make it a success, Jim...

257
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,847
The bad man was busy
kissing the boss man's butt.

258
00:12:05,023 --> 00:12:06,047
Ew!

259
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:09,890
That's right. It is ew. It's very ew.

260
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:14,092
Oscar, Kevin, this is my sister,
Penny. She's also my maid of honor.

261
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,497
Pleased to meet you.

262
00:12:15,567 --> 00:12:18,661
I'm sorry, it's Kevin?
I thought it was Gil.

263
00:12:19,938 --> 00:12:22,338
She thought I was
your boyfriend.

264
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,775
You thought
I was dating this?

265
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:27,277
What the hell is
wrong with you?

266
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,871
Oscar, it was
an honest mistake.

267
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:31,381
Him? Him?

268
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:34,084
Oscar, I would be proud to date you.

269
00:12:34,152 --> 00:12:35,244
I'm sorry.

270
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,117
I'm not gay.
I'm Kevin.

271
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,918
Nice to meet you, Kevin.

272
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:40,515
Yeah. You owe me an apology.

273
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:41,581
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean...

274
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:42,820
Are you seeing
anyone right now?

275
00:12:42,894 --> 00:12:44,054
She has a boyfriend.
He's out of town.

276
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:45,994
Cool.
Thank you.

277
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:48,498
I was the youngest VP
in company history.

278
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,899
More recently, he worked
in a bowling alley.

279
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:54,029
Tell her one of your funny
bowling alley stories.

280
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:57,507
How did Meredith get put
at the young people's table?

281
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,067
She probably switched
cards with someone.

282
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,806
Like I did with Erin.

283
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:07,681
What? You
can't... That's... You're...

284
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,746
Jim and Pam, I can't tell
you how happy I am to be here.

285
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:15,719
Head table,
where I belong.

286
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,522
It's just for family.

287
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,791
Well, who's that one?

288
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:25,402
Isabel Poreba.
I got stuff on her.

289
00:13:27,205 --> 00:13:30,902
In 1996, her 10th grade
volleyball team went ten and two.

290
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,109
What am I supposed
to do with that, Dwight?

291
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,477
That's a very
good record.

292
00:13:36,548 --> 00:13:39,210
All right, so I'll be like, "He
is so sweet, guys, and so kind."

293
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:40,683
That's when
I'll do the face like...

294
00:13:40,752 --> 00:13:42,083
Like, "What?" Right.

295
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,815
And then we'll just give him
a little punch to the back.

296
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,322
A noogie. Although, you know what?

297
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:46,414
Never too married
for a noogie.

298
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,617
Never.

299
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:51,561
They have hilarious material and they're
going to totally deliver it wrong.

300
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,191
I would kill with the brother
stuff. It should be me up there.

301
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:58,202
It should be me and Pete,
not Pete and Tom.

302
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:02,606
Pam, you've got
the greatest smile

303
00:14:02,674 --> 00:14:04,505
and your body
is really fine.

304
00:14:04,576 --> 00:14:05,600
Smoking.

305
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,271
Hoping it'll make our
wives kick it up a notch.

306
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,281
A little more cardio.

307
00:14:10,982 --> 00:14:12,950
That's not appropriate.

308
00:14:14,953 --> 00:14:16,284
Hello. Hi, everybody.

309
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,846
I promised I wasn't going to
make a toast and I'm not going to.

310
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,892
Just going to do a little
freestanding comedy,

311
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:21,983
and if at the end

312
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,255
everybody wants to raise
their glasses to Pam and Jim,

313
00:14:24,329 --> 00:14:25,853
then so be it.

314
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:30,664
Hey, what is the deal
with the Smart car?

315
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,466
How smart is that?
Those things are tiny.

316
00:14:33,538 --> 00:14:35,233
Can you even drive
them in traffic?

317
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:40,506
"Oh, I'm so smart. E
equals MC squared. I drive a Smart car."

318
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,103
That's not smart
in my book.

319
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,444
The real smart car
is KITT,

320
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:45,710
<i>from Knight Rider.
Knight Rider.</i>

321
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:49,311
That's a car that can talk.
Can Smart car talk?

322
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,413
Nope. That's not smart.
No.

323
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,650
And also Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

324
00:14:52,724 --> 00:14:53,748
Very smart.

325
00:14:53,825 --> 00:14:56,919
And everybody
can laugh.

326
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,563
It doesn't have to just be the
idiots. Everybody can laugh.

327
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:02,224
Nope.
Yeah, go ahead.

328
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,131
All right. Hey,
everyone. Thanks for coming.

329
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,191
Douche!

330
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,601
Aw! Thanks, Pete.
That was really nice.

331
00:15:06,671 --> 00:15:09,139
I just want to say
how happy we are

332
00:15:09,207 --> 00:15:10,640
that all of you
are here tonight.

333
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:12,836
And I want to especially
thank those of you

334
00:15:12,911 --> 00:15:16,347
who have traveled from far
away to be here with us tonight.

335
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,610
Especially
the Florida cousins,

336
00:15:18,683 --> 00:15:20,378
who obviously
can't take a hint.

337
00:15:22,053 --> 00:15:24,613
Four years ago,
I was just a guy

338
00:15:24,689 --> 00:15:27,089
who had a crush on a girl
who had a boyfriend.

339
00:15:27,592 --> 00:15:30,823
And I had to do the hardest
thing that I've ever had to do,

340
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:33,057
which was just to wait.

341
00:15:34,966 --> 00:15:36,900
Don't get me wrong,
I flirted with her.

342
00:15:36,968 --> 00:15:39,027
Pam, I can now admit in
front of friends and family

343
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,696
that I do know how
to make a photocopy.

344
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,808
Didn't need your help
that many times.

345
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,843
And do you remember
how long it took you

346
00:15:45,911 --> 00:15:47,378
to teach me how
to drive stick?

347
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,175
Like a year.

348
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,942
I've been driving stick
since high school.

349
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,746
So, yes, yes. For a really
long time that's all I had.

350
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:59,723
I just had little moments with
a girl who saw me as a friend.

351
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,090
And a lot of people told me
I was crazy to wait this long

352
00:16:03,161 --> 00:16:05,095
for a date with a girl
who I worked with,

353
00:16:05,163 --> 00:16:07,757
but I think
even then I knew that

354
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,066
I was waiting
for my wife.

355
00:16:12,204 --> 00:16:14,968
So, I would like
to propose a toast.

356
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:19,501
So, if you'd all raise your glasses,
not Pam, for obvious reasons.

357
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,408
But everyone else, if you
would raise your glasses...

358
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,745
What's obvious?
Why can't Pam drink?

359
00:16:25,383 --> 00:16:28,352
Pam can't drink? Who... I didn't...
I shouldn't have said that.

360
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:31,048
I don't know why I did. She
can do whatever she wants.

361
00:16:31,122 --> 00:16:35,115
Though she shouldn't. She shouldn't
because she's an alcoholic.

362
00:16:35,193 --> 00:16:36,217
Pam is an alcoholic.

363
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:37,283
Jim.

364
00:16:37,362 --> 00:16:39,421
That's not true. No.

365
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,293
What we
wanted... The real reason

366
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:48,468
is that Pam's pregnant.

367
00:16:50,108 --> 00:16:51,837
Okay, okay, okay.

368
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:56,108
Hey, what I think Jim
is trying to say is that

369
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,074
they had an accident.

370
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:04,247
And you know what? These two
people, they're living together,

371
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,847
they are having
lots of consensual sex.

372
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:08,620
They were living together?

373
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:10,923
Yes, yes, they were
living together. Yes.

374
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:16,866
And you know what? You can't expect
them to be careful every time,

375
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,165
because, frankly, it's
just a different sensation.

376
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:20,829
Michael.
When you come... Well?

377
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,999
Am I wrong? They say
it's not different,

378
00:17:23,074 --> 00:17:24,268
but it's a different
sensation...

379
00:17:24,342 --> 00:17:25,536
Oh, my God, no, please.

380
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:29,046
...when you use
something to block...

381
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,810
I think everybody knows
what I am talking about.

382
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,373
It's not necessarily
different for the woman.

383
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:34,475
Michael.

384
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,316
But it is
different... Okay, okay, okay.

385
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,878
Michael, stop.

386
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:39,321
All right.

387
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:42,516
My point is, I said
what I wanted to say.

388
00:17:42,594 --> 00:17:44,960
And, Meemaw, I hope
you heard every word.

389
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,728
All right. Jim.

390
00:17:50,535 --> 00:17:51,763
To waiting.

391
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:52,894
To waiting.

392
00:17:52,971 --> 00:17:54,700
- Okay.
- To waiting.

393
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,006
I should have known.

394
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:05,676
<i>The hotel's television set had a
movie on called Brüno last night.</i>

395
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,184
The remote control had so
darn many buttons on it,

396
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,652
I couldn't
turn it off.

397
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,781
So, I had to just sit there
while it happened to me.

398
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:16,850
I wondered, "How could
they pick such a hotel?"

399
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,590
Hmm. Now I know.

400
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,860
Meemaw.

401
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,100
I think it was a
little touch-and-go at first,

402
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:28,230
but we saved it,
I believe.

403
00:18:28,306 --> 00:18:30,365
I can't believe
it was me.

404
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:33,542
I know. I can't believe
it was you, either.

405
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,877
I actually think it takes
a lot of pressure off of me.

406
00:18:36,948 --> 00:18:38,438
Is there something
about being a manager

407
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:39,608
that makes you say
stupid things?

408
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:40,912
I have not found
that to be the case.

409
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:42,078
Hey, smooth guys.

410
00:18:42,153 --> 00:18:43,211
I am so sorry.

411
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,755
Can you believe it?
He screwed up, not me.

412
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,085
Meemaw's not coming
to the wedding.

413
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:47,590
She's leaving
tomorrow morning.

414
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:48,956
Oh, my God.
Are you serious?

415
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,858
There's going to be
a free room?

416
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,772
Hi, Meemaw.
It's Michael.

417
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,367
Oh! You're that foul man that
kept talking about intercourse.

418
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:08,071
Yes. Yep, one and the same. May I?

419
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,414
<i>I am actually
great with old women.</i>

420
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:15,510
In fact, for the longest time my
best friend was my grandmother.

421
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,714
And then she met Harriet,

422
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,917
and now she thinks she's
better than everybody.

423
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,825
I want to go to bed,
but I can't.

424
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,887
I can't turn that
television off.

425
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:31,731
Oh! Okay, well.
Hook you up there.

426
00:19:31,836 --> 00:19:32,860
Oh!

427
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:34,600
Thank you.
You're welcome.

428
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:37,005
It was that
horrible Charlie Rose.

429
00:19:37,075 --> 00:19:40,408
Oh. Isn't he terrible?
May I?

430
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,506
Here's the thing.

431
00:19:44,949 --> 00:19:47,543
Meemaw, I think you
just need to chill out

432
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,383
about this whole "Pam
getting pregnant" thing.

433
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:53,424
It's not 1890 anymore.
It's modern day.

434
00:19:53,491 --> 00:19:56,426
And women have sex
before marriage.

435
00:19:56,494 --> 00:19:58,018
And I think we need
to celebrate that.

436
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,122
And I know, in your day, she
would be considered a whore.

437
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,364
But now, women go out
and they have sex,

438
00:20:06,438 --> 00:20:09,339
and they get wild, and
they take their tops off.

439
00:20:09,407 --> 00:20:11,705
And they have pictures taken of them.

440
00:20:11,776 --> 00:20:13,937
And we need to encourage
that. That's part of life.

441
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,344
People are like cats
and dogs these days.

442
00:20:16,414 --> 00:20:17,540
Exactly.

443
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:19,446
This used to be
such a great country.

444
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:20,575
I know.

445
00:20:20,652 --> 00:20:22,517
I don't know
what happened to it.

446
00:20:22,587 --> 00:20:24,714
They're going to name the
baby after you, you know.

447
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:26,279
They're going to
call it Meemaw.

448
00:20:26,357 --> 00:20:28,450
You mean Sylvia.

449
00:20:28,526 --> 00:20:29,584
Yes.

450
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:32,896
And if it's a boy
they will call it Silvio.

451
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:36,062
Party, room 639.

452
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,192
Yes.

453
00:20:37,268 --> 00:20:40,362
Chicks are going to be off
the hook. Guys, too, Oscar.

454
00:20:40,438 --> 00:20:41,871
Like Calvin Klein models.

455
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,737
That sounds epic.

456
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:44,968
Can we bring anything?

457
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,169
Nothing.

458
00:20:46,244 --> 00:20:50,112
Except for $40 for beer
and any hot chicks you know.

459
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:53,014
Because that would help me
deliver on some promises I made.

460
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:54,108
Whoo!

461
00:20:54,185 --> 00:20:58,747
No one from the office has been
to a real Bernard throw-down.

462
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:02,088
<i>If I was a girl, I would seriously
reconsider coming to this party.</i>

463
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,926
But don't tell them that I said
that because I want them there.

464
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,231
And where do you
think you're going?

465
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,796
I was just going to go down to
the hotel bar for a little bit.

466
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,342
Well, why don't I just
save you some time

467
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,741
and kick you in the stomach instead?

468
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:22,746
I just wanted to get out of
my room for a little while.

469
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:23,872
Mmm-hmm?

470
00:21:23,948 --> 00:21:26,348
Okay, I'll go with you.
Come on.

471
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,013
Never mind.

472
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:30,213
Are you sure?
Yeah.

473
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:31,846
Could be fun.
No.

474
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,220
What are you wearing?

475
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,657
Come on. It's a casual, social outfit.

476
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:37,388
Looks like you're going
to a fish fry, Dwight.

477
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,793
No, they're howling
at the moon.

478
00:21:38,863 --> 00:21:41,855
It's suggestive to women
because of howling during sex.

479
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:43,059
Okay.

480
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,428
That's not appropriate.

481
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:49,005
Uncool.
Uncool, Dwight.

482
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:53,843
Okay, okay.
Come on, let's go.

483
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,639
Good, it's good.
No, it's not a good idea.

484
00:21:57,715 --> 00:21:59,706
There's no such thing
as a good hairpiece.

485
00:21:59,784 --> 00:22:02,412
Yeah, but that's easy
enough for you to say, Oscar.

486
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:06,218
You have that thick,
beautiful Chicano hair.

487
00:22:06,591 --> 00:22:08,218
So nice.

488
00:22:09,894 --> 00:22:11,828
I'm just worried about
the farm, you know?

489
00:22:11,896 --> 00:22:14,023
Mose hates to geld
the horses by himself.

490
00:22:14,098 --> 00:22:15,929
Dwight, Dwight,
shut up about the farm.

491
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,797
It's not relatable.
Nobody owns a farm.

492
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:21,635
Wait, you're worried about
your horses? That's cool.

493
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,674
How many horses
do you have?

494
00:22:23,741 --> 00:22:25,504
Nine and three-quarters.

495
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,546
I invented a device called
"burger on the go."

496
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:33,016
It allows you to obtain six
regular-sized hamburgers or twelve sliders

497
00:22:33,084 --> 00:22:35,951
from a horse without
killing the animal.

498
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,113
George Foreman is
still considering it.

499
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,417
Sharper lmage is
still considering it.

500
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,855
Sky Mall is still
considering it.

501
00:22:40,925 --> 00:22:43,792
Hammacher Schlemmer
is still considering it.

502
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,686
Sears said no.

503
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:57,070
<i>Toy Story,
Finding Nemo, Up.</i>

504
00:22:57,141 --> 00:22:59,974
I bawl the entire time.
I cannot watch Pixar.

505
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,068
Michael.
Yes?

506
00:23:01,145 --> 00:23:02,840
Drop this one, abort.
Why?

507
00:23:02,914 --> 00:23:05,178
I found twins.

508
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,013
Oh, my God. Twins.

509
00:23:07,619 --> 00:23:10,611
I'm sorry, you understand.
Nice to meet you.

510
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,917
Aren't they
magnificent?

511
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,560
They're men, Dwight.

512
00:23:19,697 --> 00:23:21,665
I love finding
a good set of twins.

513
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,826
Something is
wrong with you.

514
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,667
Yeah, Meredith.
That's cool.

515
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:38,872
You call that a robot? Try being
more robotic, okay? Like this.

516
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,111
Lame. What else
you got, Andy?

517
00:23:44,188 --> 00:23:46,122
How about a little
bit of this?

518
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,227
Oh, yeah?
What else you got?

519
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,525
Yeah, what
else you got?

520
00:23:53,097 --> 00:23:55,361
Did someone change my
name to Baskin Robbins?

521
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,958
Because I feel
like a banana split.

522
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,496
Whoo!

523
00:24:05,143 --> 00:24:06,440
What else you got?

524
00:24:06,511 --> 00:24:08,741
Oh! All right.
Easy. Easy.

525
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:10,007
Easy, easy.

526
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,573
It's going to be fine, it's
going to be fine. Pam's here.

527
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,811
Pam?

528
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,853
I was dancing
and I did a split

529
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:24,622
and I landed on my
car keys in my pocket.

530
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,022
What?

531
00:24:26,097 --> 00:24:29,692
I tore my scrotum. I need you
to take me to the hospital.

532
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:33,867
Andy, I'm getting
married in eight hours.

533
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:37,969
Everyone else is too drunk.
Just don't let me die here.

534
00:24:38,042 --> 00:24:40,977
Hey, hey, where are you? Can
you take Andy to the hospital?

535
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:42,034
<i>What?</i>

536
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,774
He tore his
scrotum dancing.

537
00:24:43,848 --> 00:24:44,837
<i>What?</i>

538
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:46,406
He is in my room
icing his balls.

539
00:24:46,484 --> 00:24:48,452
<i>What? Please stop saying "what."</i>

540
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,508
Can you take him?

541
00:24:49,587 --> 00:24:50,747
<i>Look, I would
so take him</i>

542
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:51,948
<i>in any other
circumstance,</i>

543
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,548
<i>but I'm pretty certain
I'm completely wasted.</i>

544
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,320
Your brothers took
you out drinking?

545
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,884
<i>Uh...
- Is that Pam?</i>

546
00:24:57,962 --> 00:25:02,228
<i>Hey, have her come out. Have her
come out. It'll be like Coyote Ugly.</i>

547
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,063
That's Michael.
You're out with Michael?

548
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:05,864
<i>- And Dwight.
- Hey-oh!</i>

549
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:06,961
<i>Pam,
it just happened.</i>

550
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,097
Okay, fine.
I'll take him.

551
00:25:09,173 --> 00:25:10,800
<i>I love you.
Okay. I got to go.</i>

552
00:25:10,875 --> 00:25:12,103
<i>I love you.</i>

553
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:13,701
Are you pushing
me off the phone?

554
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,678
<i>No. Let's talk
for a long time.</i>

555
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,044
Goodbye.

556
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:18,273
Mmm.

557
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:20,747
It's after midnight.

558
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,346
You're married.
He's married.

559
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:25,480
That's not how that works.

560
00:25:25,556 --> 00:25:27,353
Oh, my God.
Congratulations.

561
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:28,551
You're not going to
be able to talk back.

562
00:25:28,626 --> 00:25:29,854
You'll have Pam
to answer to.

563
00:25:29,927 --> 00:25:31,622
She'll be sitting
at home saying,

564
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,630
"Jim, take the baby
to the zoo,

565
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,496
"because I want to sit
at home and eat bonbons

566
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,035
"and clip my toenails."

567
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:43,096
"Jim, hey, why don't you braid
my hair? I want to watch TV."

568
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:44,471
Now you sound
like Kermit.

569
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,470
Are you sure this
is the right way?

570
00:25:46,544 --> 00:25:49,945
Nope. I, like you, have
never been here before.

571
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:53,750
Well, at least
slow down a little bit

572
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:59,222
because every little bump in the
road is major pain on my scrotum.

573
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,349
Look, I'm not the one
who asked you to do a split

574
00:26:01,426 --> 00:26:03,087
when you've
never done one before.

575
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,129
Well, I was trying to liven
things up a little bit, okay?

576
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,424
I was kind of
doing your job, so...

577
00:26:06,497 --> 00:26:07,657
My job?

578
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,925
My job is to get married in
the morning. That's my job.

579
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,266
Well, it's also to make
sure we have a great time

580
00:26:13,337 --> 00:26:15,669
at your stupid
wedding, so...

581
00:26:36,194 --> 00:26:37,422
I spent the night
with the bride,

582
00:26:37,495 --> 00:26:40,589
the night before
the wedding. Oh, yeah.

583
00:26:41,566 --> 00:26:43,796
She stepped on my hand
on her way to the bathroom.

584
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:47,497
Andy, did I dream that you
were crying through the night?

585
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:49,737
No. No,
that was real.

586
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,508
Why don't you take a picture?
Lt'll last longer.

587
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:02,212
God! Can I get
a little privacy?

588
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:14,455
Good morning,
how can I help you?

589
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:18,992
I left a pair of dress shoes in
a bag outside my door last night

590
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,029
to be cleaned and polished, but
they haven't been returned yet.

591
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:25,905
You must be Mr. Malone.
One moment, please.

592
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,035
Thank you.

593
00:27:27,111 --> 00:27:29,170
Sir, this
is the man with the shoes.

594
00:27:31,682 --> 00:27:34,116
Mr. Malone,
your shoes are gone.

595
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,250
They were stolen?

596
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,617
No, destroyed.

597
00:27:37,688 --> 00:27:38,712
What?

598
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,885
When the bag was opened by our
shoe-shine, the smell overcame him.

599
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,690
I, too, smelled them
and made the choice

600
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,287
that they must
be thrown away.

601
00:27:48,432 --> 00:27:49,899
Incinerated, actually.

602
00:27:49,967 --> 00:27:52,435
But that was
my only pair of shoes.

603
00:27:52,503 --> 00:27:54,164
It became
a safety issue, sir.

604
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,604
Well... Damn it!

605
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:02,043
I can offer you
a complimentary breakfast.

606
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:04,573
Okay.

607
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,951
You have everything?
Cell phone, charger?

608
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,487
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

609
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,087
So, you sure you don't want breakfast?

610
00:28:12,156 --> 00:28:13,919
It's the most important meal of the day.

611
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:15,788
It really is.
I'm not hungry.

612
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,795
I ate a whole bunch of sunflower
seeds after you went to sleep.

613
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,423
And besides, I wouldn't want
to take you away from Pam

614
00:28:21,499 --> 00:28:22,932
on the morning
of her wedding.

615
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,524
She needs you,
Isabel.

616
00:28:24,602 --> 00:28:26,627
That's really
sweet, Dwight.

617
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:27,864
So, I'll see you
at the wedding?

618
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,668
You know it.
Okay.

619
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,941
Okay, get out of here.

620
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:33,499
Bye.
Okay?

621
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,569
Hey, good morning.
Hi.

622
00:28:35,646 --> 00:28:36,635
It's about
damn time.

623
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:39,205
I haven't gone to the
bathroom in a day and a half.

624
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:42,150
Oh, my God, Dwight!
This room is a pit.

625
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,417
Really? Hadn't noticed.
Too busy knocking boots.

626
00:28:50,561 --> 00:28:52,620
How can you
eat like that?

627
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,995
I'm ravenous after a
night of lovemaking.

628
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,090
You?

629
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,156
Yeah, I'm hungry.

630
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,327
But I'm not going to
make a pig out of myself.

631
00:28:58,402 --> 00:29:00,302
Hey, what was she like?

632
00:29:00,671 --> 00:29:04,630
She was cute. You know, she
was hot. She was very hot.

633
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:07,200
She made love
like a tiger.

634
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,838
Bride's side or groom's side or townie?

635
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:11,245
She was from Europe.

636
00:29:11,315 --> 00:29:12,509
No kidding.
Uh-huh.

637
00:29:12,583 --> 00:29:14,380
I bet she had hairy armpits. No.

638
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:18,889
Isabel was nice, but I hope she
doesn't think this is going anywhere.

639
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:23,686
Wait a second. You're not
into her? Are you kidding me?

640
00:29:23,761 --> 00:29:25,558
No. She's Pam's best friend.

641
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:28,121
You guys could double-date.
Swap, maybe?

642
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,996
Oh, please.
Put a gun in my mouth.

643
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,329
No, you're crazy.

644
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:33,563
Look, she's a dental
hygienist from Carbondale,

645
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:36,198
and she makes love like one.
She's a bumpkin. Pass.

646
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,107
She's... Okay, do you know how
hard it is to be a hygienist?

647
00:29:39,176 --> 00:29:40,370
You have to take X-rays,

648
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:42,844
you have to scrape the
plaque off of people's teeth,

649
00:29:42,913 --> 00:29:44,403
you have to tell
kids when to spit

650
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:47,144
and make sure that they're not
scared when the dentist comes in.

651
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:48,480
It, it...

652
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:50,452
You should ask her out.

653
00:29:50,721 --> 00:29:53,849
I already have my
European girlfriend.

654
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,356
If your hat hits me in
the face one more time...

655
00:30:01,432 --> 00:30:05,425
That's funny. Your wife loved
this hat the last time she saw it.

656
00:30:14,078 --> 00:30:15,773
Oh, my God.

657
00:30:15,913 --> 00:30:16,971
Oh!

658
00:30:17,782 --> 00:30:19,773
Oscar. Angela.

659
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:23,880
Are you in
a lot of pain?

660
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:26,479
What, because of last night? No way.

661
00:30:26,557 --> 00:30:28,582
Reports have
been exaggerated.

662
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,151
Weddings make me
very emotional.

663
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:33,719
I just have
that side to me.

664
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:36,259
Yeah, people say
you cry all the time.

665
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,461
Well,
that's not...

666
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:42,036
Crotch injuries
are the worst.

667
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,767
You don't need
to tell me.

668
00:30:44,675 --> 00:30:46,040
I wasn't
telling you.

669
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,509
There's still
something there?

670
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:48,943
Excuse me?

671
00:30:49,747 --> 00:30:51,738
They didn't
get torn off?

672
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:55,780
No, they didn't... Nothing got
torn off. Who told you that?

673
00:30:56,987 --> 00:30:59,217
I may have told
some people that.

674
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,485
I'm nervous. I'm about to get married.

675
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,719
If you want
to sit on this.

676
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:09,025
I was thinking the wood might be
too hard on your damaged penis.

677
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,567
Make it softer.

678
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,699
It's my scrotum,
and it was.

679
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:19,538
Thank you.
Sure.

680
00:31:26,016 --> 00:31:27,108
Oh. Here we go.

681
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:30,551
They asked for cash. But you
know, I give them cash every week.

682
00:31:30,621 --> 00:31:33,146
So, how much cash
does a person need?

683
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:37,160
I have taken it upon myself to do
something a little more special.

684
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,789
I have painted a portrait of
the two of them from memory.

685
00:31:44,135 --> 00:31:48,504
And I have another one of them in
the nude. But that one is for me.

686
00:31:55,112 --> 00:31:59,139
I got them a set of turtle boiling
pots, shell hammer and bibs.

687
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,488
Is it zipping over your
belly? Don't squish the baby.

688
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,647
Thank you,
weirdo.

689
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,988
Everybody see Kristy's
stupid blonde extensions?

690
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:11,186
It's like they were made
from a plastic broom.

691
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,923
Okay,
here I come.

692
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:14,763
- Oh!
- Pam!

693
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,892
Darling,
you look beautiful.

694
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,026
Thanks, Mom.

695
00:32:19,637 --> 00:32:21,002
I hope
he deserves you.

696
00:32:21,071 --> 00:32:22,129
He does.

697
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:25,972
Are you sure? Remember, you
don't have to do this. You don't.

698
00:32:26,043 --> 00:32:28,307
Mom, you're totally
projecting and being a drag.

699
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:29,778
Yes, thank you, Mom.

700
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,509
Hey, I'm going to go outside
and talk to Dwight.

701
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:35,552
Okay, great. Yeah, I'll
see you in a second.

702
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:36,677
Wait. What?

703
00:32:38,589 --> 00:32:39,851
Oh, no.

704
00:32:46,063 --> 00:32:47,052
Hey.

705
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,325
<i>Can you come here, please?</i>

706
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,991
Is this allowed?

707
00:32:50,067 --> 00:32:52,968
<i>No, no. But I'm
allowing it. Just come here.</i>

708
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:56,563
That was
an intelligent comment.

709
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,904
Hello, stranger.
How do I look?

710
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:02,441
Oh! Fine. Isabel?
Nice to see you.

711
00:33:04,114 --> 00:33:05,775
What do you want?

712
00:33:07,451 --> 00:33:09,817
Nothing. Anymore.

713
00:33:10,654 --> 00:33:12,178
So, tell me again

714
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,748
the difference between
Filene's and Filene's Basement.

715
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:19,762
Hey, hey. He's not
sitting with me, either.

716
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,161
Where are you sitting?
Do you need a seat buddy?

717
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,496
I'm standing.
I'm a bridesmaid.

718
00:33:24,568 --> 00:33:27,002
Oh. I wish
I was a bridesmaid.

719
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:29,762
Where am I gonna go?

720
00:33:30,374 --> 00:33:31,432
Hey.

721
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,071
Wow.

722
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:37,847
You look...
Terrible.

723
00:33:38,148 --> 00:33:39,672
...so beautiful.

724
00:33:41,318 --> 00:33:42,478
Hey.

725
00:33:44,054 --> 00:33:45,783
My veil tore.

726
00:33:48,125 --> 00:33:51,151
I knew when we were getting married
and I'm five months pregnant,

727
00:33:51,228 --> 00:33:54,425
that I'm not going to be able to
wear the dress that I always wanted,

728
00:33:54,498 --> 00:33:56,227
or high heels.

729
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,269
Hey, you look just
as I imagined you.

730
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:01,971
Pam, you're
so pretty.

731
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:05,631
Thank you.

732
00:34:06,577 --> 00:34:10,138
And who cares? It's
a stupid veil, right?

733
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:13,141
No, this is the one thing I was supposed

734
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,708
to be able to control,
was this veil.

735
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,116
There.
Now we're even.

736
00:34:35,072 --> 00:34:37,233
Everyone's driving me crazy.

737
00:34:38,275 --> 00:34:41,108
I know way too much
about Andy's scrotum.

738
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,340
And my mom won't
stop freaking out

739
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,712
about my dad's
new girlfriend.

740
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:50,846
This is supposed to
be our wedding day.

741
00:34:50,921 --> 00:34:53,389
Why did we invite
all these people?

742
00:35:10,207 --> 00:35:12,141
I think Pam ran away
because she knew deep down

743
00:35:12,209 --> 00:35:13,904
she wouldn't be
a good wife.

744
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:14,967
Yes.

745
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,774
What are you doing?

746
00:35:17,848 --> 00:35:19,975
I'm trying to decide
if I have time to pee.

747
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:21,108
How long do you
take to pee?

748
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,210
The peeing is fast, Oscar.

749
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,448
It's getting my tie back on.

750
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:32,589
Hey. Hi. Would you have
a snack in your purse?

751
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,758
You're a mom, I just
figured you might have one.

752
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:36,857
Yeah.

753
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,629
Oh! Ooh! Apricot.

754
00:35:39,269 --> 00:35:42,033
Do you have any of the Very
Berry or Ocean Splash, or...

755
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:43,300
No.

756
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:45,205
Okay. Were you saving it?

757
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,043
No, no. That's okay. I've just...

758
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:52,181
I've had a very
rough weekend.

759
00:35:52,249 --> 00:35:53,910
Oh, I'm sorry.

760
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:59,114
Apricot.
Made of real apes.

761
00:36:00,257 --> 00:36:02,282
Do you think they
canceled the wedding?

762
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,827
Relax, you'll get
your shot at Jim.

763
00:36:04,895 --> 00:36:08,490
Those two treat the whole
office like a 1970s key party.

764
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,029
My weekend
was bad so far.

765
00:36:12,102 --> 00:36:13,126
Oh!

766
00:36:13,704 --> 00:36:15,672
I came here hoping
to meet somebody,

767
00:36:15,739 --> 00:36:17,969
you know,
as you do at weddings.

768
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,670
End up going to sleep
by the vending machine.

769
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:24,740
It was loud,
but it was warm.

770
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,077
That sounds awful.

771
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:30,314
And the love of my life
is dating somebody else.

772
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:32,018
Just...

773
00:36:32,956 --> 00:36:34,856
It is a terrible year
for love.

774
00:36:34,925 --> 00:36:37,450
Yeah, I guess it is.

775
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:40,723
Thinking about
having my sperm frozen.

776
00:36:42,332 --> 00:36:43,890
Excuse me,
you Michael Scott?

777
00:36:43,967 --> 00:36:45,025
Yeah.

778
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,263
Heard you might have
a whoopee cushion on you.

779
00:36:47,337 --> 00:36:49,202
Our sister's in the can and
we totally want to get her

780
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:50,297
when she comes back.

781
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,398
Oh...

782
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:55,002
Wow. That sounds
hilarious. I do, actually.

783
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:56,409
There you go,
use it in good health.

784
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,947
Yes.

785
00:36:58,949 --> 00:37:01,850
Wait a minute. What is the
etiquette on taking the gifts?

786
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,147
Can you only
take your own back?

787
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,654
Or is it a
whatever-you-can-carry thing?

788
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,749
Anyone have anything they
want to trade for a toaster?

789
00:37:08,826 --> 00:37:10,691
Does it have
slots for hot dogs?

790
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:11,955
No.

791
00:37:12,029 --> 00:37:13,428
Who would want it?

792
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:15,863
Guys, maybe we should
wait a little more time

793
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,423
before we start
grabbing boxes.

794
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,896
Toby.

795
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,028
Dwight.

796
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,902
I'd like to lodge a formal
complaint against Jim

797
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:24,907
for making us wait
for over an hour.

798
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,944
God. Crap!

799
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:36,782
Come here, you.
Get in there.

800
00:37:37,654 --> 00:37:40,680
Well, I guess this wedding
is not going to happen.

801
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,089
I wonder if this
is it for them?

802
00:37:46,196 --> 00:37:47,891
Hey, what happened?
Where were you guys?

803
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:49,523
Do you know how long
I've been waiting here?

804
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,465
Well, we are here now,
so let's go.

805
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:52,763
Yes! Yes!

806
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:58,998
I have so much joy in my
heart right now. How do I look?

807
00:37:59,076 --> 00:38:00,065
You look great.

808
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,475
You look great.

809
00:38:04,381 --> 00:38:06,076
Wear a tie much?

810
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,468
Oh, boy.

811
00:38:41,552 --> 00:38:43,179
I begged them not to.

812
00:38:43,253 --> 00:38:44,277
Mmm-hmm.

813
00:38:44,354 --> 00:38:46,652
I know you specifically put this
song on your do-not-play list.

814
00:38:46,723 --> 00:38:47,712
Yes, I did.

815
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:48,780
I'm sorry.

816
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:52,490
Go ahead,
I think it's your turn.

817
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,190
Wait, what happened?
You're okay with this?

818
00:38:54,264 --> 00:38:55,925
Yeah, I'm okay.

819
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:57,159
Okay, then.

820
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:01,095
Hey, Pam? Did you see
this? It was on YouTube.

821
00:39:01,171 --> 00:39:02,399
Saw it.

822
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:43,497
I bought those boat tickets the
day I saw that YouTube video.

823
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:45,432
I knew we'd
need a backup plan.

824
00:41:45,502 --> 00:41:49,097
The boat was actually plan C.
The church was plan B.

825
00:41:49,172 --> 00:41:53,734
And plan A was marrying
her a long, long time ago.

826
00:41:55,178 --> 00:41:57,043
Pretty much
the day I met her.

827
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:11,920
What an awesome party! The
best wedding I've ever been to.

828
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,986
I got six numbers.

829
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:17,465
One more would have been
a complete telephone number.

830
00:42:19,002 --> 00:42:20,629
This was epic.

831
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:25,035
My Kleenex shoes were a
huge conversation piece.

832
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:28,737
But, man,
my dogs are barking.

833
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,242
Ooh!

834
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:39,285
My feet were so sweaty,
I can't even feel the cold.

835
00:42:40,991 --> 00:42:42,754
What a lovely hotel.

836
00:42:43,026 --> 00:42:44,015
Okay.
