1
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,177
Oh... Oh

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:14,596
What is this?

3
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:19,143
A meatball? Really?

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,354
It's always more fun to mess
with Dwight with an audience

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,814
That was usually Pam

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,108
So now that she's out,
I had to find someone else

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,362
Turns out that Stanley
is quite the comedy fan

8
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,241
But not everything
makes him laugh.

9
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,703
He has very specific tastes.

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,752
Through a painstaking process of trial
and error, I found out what he likes.

11
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,796
And it's really weird

12
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,883
Jim, come on. So juvenile

13
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,343
What the

14
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,471
You've been meatballed

15
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,682
Are you ready
for some meatballs?

16
00:00:58,767 --> 00:00:59,975
Oh, man

17
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,311
This is not very clever, Jim

18
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,605
I know
Look for your stapler

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,070
Really, Jim? Really?

20
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:14,823
Very funny

21
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,951
Okay, good night

22
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,507
What's the haul?

23
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,300
Thirty-two meatballs

24
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,552
Good day

25
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,596
That idiot's been
feeding us for a week

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,765
We'll never have to
buy meatballs again

27
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,208
Dunder Mifflin

28
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,044
Jessica, hi, how are you?

29
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,296
Yay, that's so great to hear

30
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,590
I'm not going to be one of
those exes who can't move on.

31
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,801
They have their
life and I have mine

32
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,761
I'm taking an Italian class

33
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:22,683
So far, I have learned tortellini
spaghettini, linguine.

34
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,310
Well, it's not so much
a class as a restaurant

35
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,063
But I do Monday Wednesday,
Friday from 7:00 to 9:00

36
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,107
I will patch you
through right now

37
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,068
You sound really
pretty today. Okay

38
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,283
Jessica, I love you

39
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:41,493
That's a message from my mom

40
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:45,247
My parents met Jessica and they
completely flipped for her so

41
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,041
they gave me this old
family ring to use on her

42
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,085
Pump the brakes, Bernard

43
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,588
Too early, I get it
I just... You know

44
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,007
I'm just carrying it around
seeing how it feels.

45
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,342
I haven't proposed
to anyone in years

46
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,804
Mom took the main diamond out
She thought that had more of a

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,098
"my little brother"
kind of vibe to it. But

48
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,310
Whoa. It's pretty nice

49
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,228
Got a little bit of
The Shining vibe, though

50
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,730
Who needs a house that size?

51
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,024
Big, stupid, pure chump bait

52
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,775
I'm selling the house
actually.

53
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,028
No, there's
a glare from over here

54
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,113
Oh, wow, that's magnificent

55
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,159
It's mid-recession in a depressed
area of a faltering state,

56
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,494
and I've got the most expensive
house on the market.

57
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,580
The 1% are
suffering too, people

58
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,958
I bought it to be
my Playboy Mansion

59
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,463
A temple to wine,
revelry, sex, intrigue

60
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,716
This was hot on the heels of
Eyes Wide Shut, mind you.

61
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:41,553
Then I met my wife,
she moved in, made it her own

62
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,306
Now she's left me and forced
me to sell the place.

63
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:46,350
The ultimate insult
they're calling

64
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,143
my speakeasy
lounge a rumpus room

65
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,065
Does my turmoil
amuse you, Jim?

66
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:55,525
I'm sorry. I thought
you were making a joke

67
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,112
What could you possibly have
found funny in what I said?

68
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,323
What was the joke
you thought you heard?

69
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:05,869
I guess I thought
you were approaching it

70
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,330
with more of
a sarcasm than misery

71
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:11,875
Kind of laughing
at your own pain

72
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:13,585
Sad clown thing

73
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,797
Oh, yes. How hilarious it is

74
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,510
to laugh at clowns, the painted
jesters of a dying circus industry

75
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,095
Very funny, Jim. I get it

76
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:28,558
Um, I'm getting reports of a serious
outbreak of the "grumpies" in here.

77
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:34,147
A beautiful monster cost me
my 40s and my dream home

78
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,943
I think I'm entitled to
the occasional bad day

79
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:40,612
Well, please tell
Susan we all say hi

80
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,199
Dude, what if
since you're feeling grumpy

81
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,411
we all swing by
tonight and check out

82
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:48,912
your indoor pool?
Kevin, no

83
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,206
Like some sort
of last hurrah?

84
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:54,918
Yeah. All of us in the pool
saying hurrah.

85
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,838
Maybe the last one
that says hurrah is "it.'

86
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:01,800
Well, I suppose someone
should enjoy the place

87
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,512
before I hand it over to the staging
experts at RE/MAX tomorrow.

88
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,680
Let's try this

89
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,683
Everyone, tonight, my house
wear a swimsuit

90
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,518
Let's just call
it a get-together

91
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,145
And let's say no food

92
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,441
Hey, Oscar, was
that you who just

93
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,986
created a party out of
thin air or was it me?

94
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,237
That was you, Kevin

95
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,572
It was me

96
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,283
You going tonight, kiddo?
Because I can give you a lift

97
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,826
Oh, I don't know
Meredith, it seems like

98
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,411
you shouldn't drive
maybe ever

99
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,705
It's no problem.
You live right near me

100
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:32,789
How do you know
where I live?

101
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:35,083
Andy followed you home
after the Christmas party

102
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,002
Why?

103
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,962
He wanted to make sure
California didn't put it in you.

104
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,255
Oh. Come on

105
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,679
Wow. Andy's such
a weird stalker.

106
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,099
Following me home like that
when he has a girlfriend,

107
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,602
a restraining order

108
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,105
It is warm

109
00:05:57,899 --> 00:05:58,940
It's almost too warm

110
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,069
I'm feeling 82, 82.5

111
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,196
Oh. So close. Eighty-one

112
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,616
Well, we'll say it's 82
and it'll be our secret

113
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,370
Hey, late guy
Hey

114
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,791
Wow. Just stopping by.
Got another party to go to

115
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,877
A wife and two kids
at home party Oh

116
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:22,756
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some
serious Radio Disney tonight.

117
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,176
You're looking at the master
of leaving parties early

118
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,969
The key is you have to
make a strong impression

119
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,806
so you want to have a picture taken,
you want to say some peculiar

120
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,849
non sequitur that
people remember

121
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:36,520
you want to note something unique,
a talking point for later

122
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:40,607
I don't mean to brag but New
Year's Eve, I was home by 9:00.

123
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,652
Robert, I just wanted to
grab you for one second

124
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,237
This place is amazing
by the way.

125
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,405
You should see
the whole thing

126
00:06:50,284 --> 00:06:51,701
That's beautiful. I'm going
to e-mail that to you

127
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,036
I'm just about
to give the tour

128
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,413
All right. Well
Join us

129
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,081
You must see what you
were laughing about.

130
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,252
Wow

131
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,675
Yeah, that's some
pretty serious poolage

132
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,969
What are you doing?
Hmm?

133
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,346
Flicking a bug
off my weiner.

134
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,181
Gross

135
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,975
I'm getting a drink
Do you want anything?

136
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,059
No, I'm good

137
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:24,025
Funny how you can be surrounded by
people and still feel so lonely

138
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,528
Hi
Hi

139
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:29,656
How is everything?
How's your car?

140
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,995
It's great, you know,
reliable, great mileage

141
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,288
Is that so?

142
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,584
How about this weekend we take that
sucker to a duck pond or something?

143
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,961
Maybe get caught in the rain

144
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,340
Well, I can't. I'm
going skiing with Jessica

145
00:07:48,176 --> 00:07:49,843
Couple of dopes
on the slopes.

146
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,344
Oh. Like a goodbye trip

147
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,763
No. What?

148
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:56,808
Hey
Hi

149
00:07:56,893 --> 00:08:00,228
I guess Andy isn't totally
over his current girlfriend.

150
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,980
But if he was
jealous once before

151
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,815
then maybe I can
make him jealous again

152
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,317
Just not with Robert

153
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:09,196
He told me he was a ridel wouldn't survive
and I believe him.

154
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,616
Wow. You made it.
Yeah. Yeah

155
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,829
Uh-oh. Look at this Red
plastic cup, red plastic cup.

156
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,331
How about that?

157
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,750
You know, you are
just as dumb at night

158
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,001
Mmm

159
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,254
There is...
This would be no problem

160
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,049
No! Show me.
All right

161
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:31,968
Dive in from here
right now. Okay.

162
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,433
Hey, Dwight Snoot What you doing?
Wait, relaxing. Scram

163
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,976
God

164
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:44,606
Hey, Stanley,
what happened to my pants?

165
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,318
I moved them. Pants only need a
chair if there's a person in them

166
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:57,035
Come on,
don't you want to play?

167
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,537
Oh, really?
Yeah.

168
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,829
You want to play
you little hick?

169
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,542
Dwight

170
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,126
Awesome
- Dwight!

171
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,296
Here we have
the parlor.

172
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,133
Would set down their coats

173
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,803
and symbolically
their inhibitions.

174
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,472
This was the gateway

175
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:21,643
You enter this room a lawyer,
a doctor, a teacher, a judge,

176
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:27,023
but beyond it you are simply a
penis a vagina, a hunger, an ache

177
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,527
Susan used it as
a Pilates studio

178
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,861
Holy cow

179
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,822
My wine collection

180
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:35,574
How many bottles?
Three hundred?

181
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,908
About 1,200.

182
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,827
What the hell
grab a bottle.

183
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,996
Less inventory
for the lawyers

184
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,248
Toby, ChÉteau Margaux, '95

185
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,541
You know your wine

186
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:50,672
Well. And you have a
Yes, another ch√¢teau

187
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,966
Robert, you are too kind

188
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,968
Oh Too kind doesn't
begin to cover it.

189
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:58,555
With ammunition like this, we are
in for quite a night you and me

190
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,348
And Gabey makes three

191
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,935
Robert, thank you. Thank you for
this, thank you for all this

192
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,145
This night's been magical

193
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,396
Jim, come see
this next room

194
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,315
especially would like it

195
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,233
Really? Why?
I don't know

196
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,193
Maybe not. Just come

197
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,203
Do you regret
attacking me now, hick?

198
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,790
Huh? Dwight. Stop it. I
was flirting with you

199
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,001
I was trying to use
you to make Andy jealous

200
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,502
I'm not going to help you

201
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,296
Why would you choose me?
Because I'm mighty?

202
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:34,257
Because I'm the manliest man
in the office? I'll do it!

203
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,848
Stop.
You stop

204
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,767
No, you stop.
No, you stop

205
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,354
Is he looking? You can stop

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,980
Okay, you can stop No,
no, no he's not looking.

207
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,148
You can actually stop

208
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,691
Whoa, you guys

209
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:54,694
I just found this
insane engagement ring

210
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,862
Is anyone missing this?

211
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,072
The main stone's missing

212
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,366
It looks pretty great to me

213
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,912
I pictured myself
here every night

214
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,373
eating a leg of
mutton, the juices

215
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,918
dripping down my bare chest,
wiping my fingers on the walls

216
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,253
Then I met the vegan

217
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,006
Good night.
To the kitchen

218
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,883
To the kitchen
To the kitchen

219
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:19,678
To the kitchen

220
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,264
Onward
- Toby

221
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,184
what's compelling about this
is the note of persimmon

222
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,936
Right?
Note?

223
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,854
It's a symphony
Okay.

224
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,898
You have to join my
wine tasting club.

225
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,445
Toby, you are
playing a dangerous game

226
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:41,783
I guess I'm through
the gateway now though, right?

227
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:46,955
You know

228
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:50,625
I don't think I've ever been
in this exact angle before.

229
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,086
I'm scared of firsts
but I like it.

230
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,130
You guys got to
try this pool.

231
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,134
No top scum, no Band-Aids
this thing is choice.

232
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,635
You in?

233
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:03,304
Yeah. Sure, sure
I'll be right in

234
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,556
I've been working out

235
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,810
but the problem is, I've been
building muscle underneath

236
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:13,148
and that top layer
hasn't burned off yet

237
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,150
Awkward stage

238
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,402
Mmm

239
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,239
So good. Now take a chip
and crush it into my face

240
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,492
and rub the grease around
Do it. Yeah, rub it in.

241
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:26,327
Yeah
That's so good

242
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,580
Andy's not even looking

243
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:31,332
eating is a dead end
Damn it.

244
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:35,378
What is the most
romantic possible thing?

245
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,257
We can get some chicken fights
going in the pool.

246
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:42,510
Dwight, that's just
That's really perfect

247
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,721
Thank you. Yes
Yes!

248
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,517
You're in my lane

249
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:51,811
Andy

250
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,147
Dwight and I challenge you
and Jess to a chicken fight.

251
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,231
Winner take all

252
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,357
Chicken fight

253
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,859
No, thanks
Dang it!

254
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,110
What the heck already

255
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,196
Cathy, chicken fight

256
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,365
Okay, yeah, who's going to be my partner?
Where's Jim?

257
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,367
I'm right here

258
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,209
Come on, Cath

259
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:16,961
Yes

260
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,046
Whoo

261
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,841
Dwight, our chemistry is really
clicking We work so well together

262
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,344
I know. I could just
bang you right now

263
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,598
He's not looking. Hey

264
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:32,852
I had two bears sewn together
to make this king size.

265
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,396
Total waste of two bears

266
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:38,608
To both these bears

267
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,194
To both these bears
- Bears.

268
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,404
To both these bears

269
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:48,618
When I put in the screening
room I bought three movies

270
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:53,373
Caligula, Last Tango in
Paris and Emmanuelle 2.

271
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,041
Mwa

272
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:59,671
The last two movies I
actually watched in here were

273
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,591
Marley & Me and
On Golden * Pond.

274
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,594
I mean, it's clearly meant
for watching erotic cinema

275
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,763
Yeah. We could watch some
right now, if you want.

276
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,433
I've got a Korean
film on my iPod.

277
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,270
If you want to just...
If you have the cables

278
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,815
Kelly, that's
a crazy ring you found

279
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,150
Yeah. Thanks, I'm
really glad that I found it

280
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,777
I can't believe
you're wearing it

281
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,237
Are you not
superstitious at all?

282
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,948
Of course I'm superstitious,
what are you talking about?

283
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,994
Ring of a failed marriage might
have some sinister energy, right?

284
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,245
Am I just being silly?

285
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,955
I don't think
you're being silly

286
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,039
Oh, God

287
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,291
You know what?
I can just sell it

288
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,667
and put the money
in the party fund.

289
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,377
Oh

290
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,254
Then another woman will get
it, we can't allow that

291
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,797
We have to destroy it

292
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,632
Come on. Let's
chicken fight those two

293
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,348
How was that?
Okay, watch my toes

294
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,936
Hey, Val, want a beer?

295
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,355
It might taste better than that
pool water you've been drinking

296
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,815
No, I'm good. Thank you

297
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,400
Cool
Cool.

298
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,195
Does Darryl not swim?

299
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,073
That's racist. I don't know

300
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:13,328
but I would say by looking at
him, no, Darryl does not swim

301
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,540
That's all right That's all right!
We got this

302
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,167
Yeah
Yeah

303
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:24,339
Maybe we should take a little
break Dwight, we've got this.

304
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,175
I promise. I will not leave
your shoulders no matter what

305
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:28,843
Okay

306
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,970
One more?
Yeah. Great

307
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,726
Mush! Mush! Mush

308
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,687
Come on
Go

309
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,192
Here we go

310
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,194
Yay

311
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:48,196
Whoa
Wow.

312
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,115
I cannot believe you're still on.
I can't believe it either

313
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,159
I've got this!

314
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,886
Erin, did we win?

315
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,681
Sure. Sure, we did

316
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,392
You're lying.
We didn't win

317
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:20,353
Hey, hey, hey, Dwight It's okay!
Just rest. Just rest.

318
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,730
You've broken up your last
couple, you evil ring.

319
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,565
Do it

320
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:29,237
We're in the pool
Shove it, Angela.

321
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,241
Same old party
same old people, am I right?

322
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:35,284
Reminds me of
Phyllis' birthday

323
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,287
Ooh. Do not remind me
of Phyllis' birthday I know.

324
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,417
But boy, that Erin, she sure is
a ripe little tiger, isn't she?

325
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,377
Meow!

326
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,588
And to think I always thought
of her as a second Meredith

327
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,634
Respectfully, I don't
want us walking into

328
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,262
a similar Angela kind
of situation Mmm.

329
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,681
So I just want to make sure
that you are completely

330
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:59,434
100% done with Erin

331
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:05,857
Last I checked I'm with Jessica
and I like to get my mongo on

332
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,943
It's monogamy
for my hog and me

333
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,403
Not what I asked
We're done

334
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,113
Erin and I are over.
Okay

335
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:16,534
So then you won't mind if
tonight I just go crazy on her?

336
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,870
Just go nuts...

337
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,955
With sex

338
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:22,749
Have at it

339
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,960
Or take it slow,
whatever you guys work out

340
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,090
You're an idiot

341
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,939
Cannonba

342
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,571
Let's do this

343
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
Oh

344
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,332
So I kind of stepped on this
I think it's yours.

345
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,833
Yeah

346
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,460
Oh. Wow

347
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,629
How did you know
it was mine?

348
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,090
The Bernard family seal, duh

349
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,884
Duh

350
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,306
Sorry if your
special night was ruined

351
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:25,186
Oh, whoa, whoa, no
it's not a special night

352
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,939
Oh, you weren't
going to do it?

353
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,901
Honestly, Erin, I don't know what I'm doing

354
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:41,744
Thank you

355
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,959
Andy's confused

356
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,503
That's not what I was hoping for.
But it's not so bad either

357
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,718
And, of course
the pool.

358
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:04,100
Ultimate lubricant
for any wild evening

359
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:10,231
It was here that my parties would
have crescendoed into true madness

360
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,650
To madness

361
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,652
Madness.
To madness

362
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,070
To madness

363
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,617
Hey, I think you
parked my car in

364
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,952
Is there any way
you can move your van?

365
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:25,663
Hey, I'm sorry When I got
here, I put my keys in a bowl

366
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,789
Are you serious?

367
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,750
Robert, I want you to know I'm here
to rock with you as late as you want

368
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,211
And that goes
double for me

369
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,088
I'll stay even
later than you'd like

370
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,643
Toby, I am Bacchus
god of wine.

371
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,353
And I am Bacchus' friend

372
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:57,361
Gentlemen, bear witness
while I've been

373
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,280
mourning the nights
that never were

374
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,033
one of them has been
unfolding here before me

375
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:10,124
This is no get-together

376
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,793
This is a party

377
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,058
Yes

378
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,983
And there's
my talking point

379
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,259
Yes, that's it.
Push yourselves, boys

380
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:05,012
It's not a party if you don't
do something that scares you

381
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,856
You two keep going

382
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,277
Hey, he's asleep.
We can just leave

383
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:21,195
So leave
