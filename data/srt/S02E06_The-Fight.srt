1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:05,838
Where is my desk?

2
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:09,274
That is weird.

3
00:00:09,276 --> 00:00:12,878
This is not funny.
This is totally unprofessional.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,013
Okay. Well, you're the one
who lost the desk.

5
00:00:14,015 --> 00:00:16,148
I didn't lose my desk.

6
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:18,550
Calm down. Where was
the last place you saw it?

7
00:00:18,552 --> 00:00:19,985
Okay, who moved my desk?

8
00:00:19,987 --> 00:00:21,987
I think you should retrace
your steps.

9
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:23,789
Okay, I am going

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,190
to tell Michael

11
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:28,460
and this entire office
will be punished.

12
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,728
Colder.

13
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,632
Warmer.

14
00:00:35,235 --> 00:00:36,301
Little warmer.

15
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,038
There you go.
Ooh, warmer.

16
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,272
Warmer.

17
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:42,274
With enthusiasm.
Warmer.

18
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:43,509
Warmer. Warmer.

19
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:44,676
Cold. Cold. Cold.

20
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:45,744
Back up.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,847
Ooh. Ooh. Warmer.

22
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,484
Hot. Red hot. Hot.

23
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,620
Very hot.

24
00:01:07,167 --> 00:01:08,567
Dwight Schrute.

25
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,868
Hi, Dwight.

26
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,837
Um, what sort of discounts
are we giving

27
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,238
on the 20 pound white?

28
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,207
Jim, I've given you
this information like 20 times.

29
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:16,575
I know.

30
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,580
It's by the ream?

31
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,915
Uh, yeah.

32
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,184
It is now 9.78.

33
00:01:25,186 --> 00:01:26,952
So it's a discount of 7%.

34
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,421
Okay, thank you.
Gotta get back to work.

35
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,061
Wash your hands, Kevin.

36
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,597
Right.

37
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,632
Oh, well, let me just
check the pricing list.

38
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,135
Hold on one second.
Sensei.

39
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:17,736
Hello, it's sempai.

40
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:21,607
You know what, let me
give you a call right back.

41
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,809
I'm going to find it
and then I'll call you back.

42
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:24,977
Thanks.

43
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:27,246
Yes, I just had a ques...

44
00:02:27,248 --> 00:02:29,014
Yes, sensei.

45
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,849
Arigato goazai mashta.

46
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:32,117
Hai.

47
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,155
Was that your mom?

48
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,323
No. That was my sensei.

49
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,726
Oh, thought it was your mom.

50
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,295
I am now sempai,

51
00:02:43,297 --> 00:02:45,464
which is assistant sensei.

52
00:02:45,466 --> 00:02:47,032
Assistant to the sensei,
that's pretty cool.

53
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,600
Assistant sensei.
Okay.

54
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:53,005
I am a practitioner
of Goju-Ryu Karate

55
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,306
here in Scranton.

56
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,908
Huh!

57
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:57,242
- 2.
- Huh!

58
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:58,911
Dwight,
stamp and kick back. 3.

59
00:02:58,913 --> 00:02:59,945
Huh!

60
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:02,147
My sensei, Ira,

61
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,349
recently promoted me
to purple belt

62
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,419
and gave me the duties
of a sempai.

63
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,254
Not that a lot of people
here in America

64
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,256
know what a sempai is.

65
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:14,526
But it's equally as respected
as a sensei.

66
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:22,167
I don't want to stay
until 7:00 again this year.

67
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:25,003
I don't really have
any control over that, Stanley.

68
00:03:29,475 --> 00:03:32,911
Michael tends
to procrastinate a bit

69
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,580
whenever he has to do work.

70
00:03:34,582 --> 00:03:36,248
Um, time cards.

71
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,784
He has to sign these
every Friday.

72
00:03:38,786 --> 00:03:40,185
Purchase orders
have to be approved

73
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,853
at the end of every month.

74
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:43,789
And expense reports.

75
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,524
All he has to do
is initial these

76
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,259
at the end of every quarter.

77
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:50,162
But once a year, it all falls
on the same Friday.

78
00:03:50,164 --> 00:03:51,830
And that's today.

79
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:54,399
I call it the perfect storm.

80
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:01,607
Did you ask me here
for any specific reason?

81
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,208
Ah, yes. I did.

82
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,277
Here's the bizzle.

83
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,513
I have a very top secret
mission for you.

84
00:04:08,515 --> 00:04:11,316
I want you to update all the
emergency contact information.

85
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:13,085
Why is that secret?

86
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:15,387
Hello. Oh, God.

87
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,588
Busy work. Get away.
Get away.

88
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,789
Ah, cretin.

89
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,825
Um, I put stickers
so you know where to sign.

90
00:04:19,827 --> 00:04:21,326
Yes, thanks.
I know where to sign.

91
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,195
It's just that last year, you...

92
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,763
Last year,
they were out of order,

93
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,198
weren't they, Pam?

94
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,834
Well, the last pickup
for overnight deliveries

95
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:31,503
is at 7:00, so you need
to have them signed by then

96
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:33,472
or much earlier.

97
00:04:33,474 --> 00:04:36,308
Chillax, Pam.
Stop Pam-MSing.

98
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,809
That's pretty good.

99
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:39,544
Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan

100
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:41,046
on a top secret mission.

101
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,781
Tell her what it is.

102
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,384
Updating emergency contacts.

103
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,553
Well, is that really a priority?

104
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:49,821
Is it a priority?

105
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,123
Oh, I don't know.

106
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,292
Um, what if there's
a tornado, Pam?

107
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:55,294
People's legs are crushed
under rubble.

108
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:58,730
Please, would you be so kind
as to call my wife?

109
00:04:58,732 --> 00:05:00,399
No. I can't.

110
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,534
Because we don't have any
emergency contact information

111
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,469
because Pam said
it wasn't a priority.

112
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:05,871
Think.
Think with your head, Pam.

113
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,572
Okay, well, she walks out.

114
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:09,608
That's the problem
with being a boss

115
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,544
is that when you are tough,
they resent you

116
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,813
and when you are cool,
they walk all over you.

117
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,049
Catch-22.

118
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:20,218
Catch-22. Yes.

119
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:24,089
Why don't you give me

120
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,557
your contact information
to start with, okay?

121
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:26,892
What's your cell?

122
00:05:27,894 --> 00:05:29,628
Uh, Larissa Halpert.

123
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,762
What's her address?

124
00:05:30,764 --> 00:05:33,999
Uh, Vonburgen Street.

125
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:35,334
Hello.

126
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:38,437
Hey, Ryan.

127
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:41,540
This is Michael Jackson

128
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:43,475
calling from Wonderland.

129
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,311
You mean Neverland?

130
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,047
This is Tito.

131
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:53,685
What?

132
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,591
Your major and minor lines

133
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:01,660
cross at a ridge.

134
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:02,928
That sucks.

135
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,664
You're making this up
as you go along, aren't you?

136
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,165
I am just following
the web site.

137
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,266
Well...

138
00:06:08,268 --> 00:06:09,968
at least I don't have cavities.

139
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,471
Yes, you have very nice teeth.

140
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,538
Thanks.

141
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,640
Who's your emergency contact?

142
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:17,943
Stacey.

143
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:23,849
Pick up.

144
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,552
Hello?

145
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:30,789
This is Mike Tyson.

146
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,193
Hey, Dwight.

147
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:38,697
As sempai, do you ever think
there's gonna be a day

148
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,601
where humans and robots
can peacefully coexist?

149
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:44,169
Impossible.

150
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:46,705
The way they're programmed...

151
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,442
You're mocking me.
No, I'm not.

152
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,478
Well, let me offer you
a little piece of advice.

153
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,015
I am not afraid
to make an example out of you.

154
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,750
Well, that's not advice.

155
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,852
What advice sounds like is this.

156
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:03,555
Um, don't ever bring
your purple belt to work

157
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:06,124
because someone might steal it.

158
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,526
Okay, give that back to me.

159
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:08,994
Okay, say please.

160
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:10,362
No. That is not a toy.

161
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:11,763
Please.
Please.

162
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,999
Good. And it absolutely
is a toy.

163
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:15,367
Arigato.
Arigato.

164
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:16,902
This is not a toy.

165
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,670
This is a message

166
00:07:18,672 --> 00:07:21,273
for the entire office
so that everyone

167
00:07:21,275 --> 00:07:22,507
could see that I am capable

168
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:23,708
of physically dominating them.

169
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,248
And this is more
of a yin yang thing.

170
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,818
The Michael is all cursive,
Scott all caps.

171
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,486
Left brain, right brain.

172
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,822
Or a duality of man.

173
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,826
Could you practice on the forms?

174
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,731
No women or children
unless provoked.

175
00:07:46,733 --> 00:07:48,233
Okay. Roy.

176
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:50,202
Warehouse guy.
Doesn't count.

177
00:07:50,204 --> 00:07:52,204
Okay. Michael.
Could you beat up Michael?

178
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,839
Yeah, I don't think
that would happen.

179
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,308
Cause we're friends.

180
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,710
Because I would kick his ass.

181
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:00,645
Well, Dwight's purple belt.

182
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,814
So? I've beat up
black belts. Yeah.

183
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:05,250
How'd you know
they were black belts?

184
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:07,018
They told me after.

185
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,188
See, I used to run
with a very tough crowd,

186
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:12,357
street fighter types.

187
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:14,826
Real, real bad people.

188
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,795
I'm just lucky I got out.

189
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,830
Is your wife still your contact?

190
00:08:18,832 --> 00:08:21,333
Uh, ex-wife, yeah.

191
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:23,401
Uh, her last name is Becker now.

192
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,938
Okay.

193
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,507
You don't need to write "ex".

194
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:30,809
And after that,

195
00:08:30,811 --> 00:08:34,646
nobody ever messed with
the damn rascals ever again.

196
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,947
Sounds tough.

197
00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:37,782
When you're a Jet,

198
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:39,985
you're a Jet all the way, right?
You're a Jet?

199
00:08:39,987 --> 00:08:41,520
Have you signed
the expense reports yet?

200
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:42,754
Yes, in theory I have.

201
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:46,725
I just need to cross
some Ts and dot some Is.

202
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,393
All right.

203
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:50,061
I am going to be in my office,

204
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:52,697
if anybody needs me.

205
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,165
Hoo! Ha!

206
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,667
Oh, wow.
Michael.

207
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,869
Sleeper hold.
Bed time for vato.

208
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,204
Oh.

209
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,472
Stop it.

210
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:01,873
Oh ho ho ho.

211
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,008
You are the weakest link.

212
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,342
Ow!

213
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:06,344
I'm friends with everybody
in this office.

214
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:09,414
We're all best friends.
I love everybody here.

215
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,918
But sometimes your best friends

216
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,220
start coming in to work late

217
00:09:15,222 --> 00:09:16,788
and start having dentist
appointments

218
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,523
that aren't dentist
appointments.

219
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,692
And that is when it's nice
to let them know

220
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,861
that you could beat them up.

221
00:09:22,863 --> 00:09:24,195
Just hit me.
You'll see.

222
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,363
I can't.

223
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,399
Cause I just got a manicure.

224
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,901
Oh, queer!
Eye. Queer Eye.

225
00:09:29,903 --> 00:09:31,903
That's a good show.
Important show.

226
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,071
Go ahead. Do it.

227
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,040
Just have Dwight punch you.

228
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,841
Oh, yeah. Well, that would
be kind of worthless

229
00:09:36,843 --> 00:09:38,777
because I know
a ton of 14-year-old girls

230
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:40,545
who could kick his ass.

231
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,314
You know a ton
of 14-year-old girls.

232
00:09:45,351 --> 00:09:46,418
Look. Dwight is a wuss.
When we rented Armageddon,

233
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,286
he cried at the end of it.

234
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:49,955
No, Michael, I told you.

235
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:51,623
That was because
it was New Year's Eve

236
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,358
and it started to snow
at exactly midnight.

237
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,459
Bruce Willis.

238
00:09:54,461 --> 00:09:56,161
They're going to leave him
on the asteroid.

239
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:57,295
Okay, I'll punch you.

240
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,530
Oh, okay.
Here we go.

241
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,898
All right. Come on.

242
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,865
Gah!

243
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,870
Oh!

244
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:07,339
Did I want to harm Michael,

245
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:09,507
the one man
I've been hired to protect?

246
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,176
No, I did not.

247
00:10:11,178 --> 00:10:12,143
Are you okay?

248
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:13,178
Yes.

249
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,446
Are you sure you're all right?

250
00:10:14,448 --> 00:10:16,114
Yeah. Yeah.

251
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,350
Thank you.

252
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:24,756
I come from a long line
of fighters.

253
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:25,957
My maternal grandfather

254
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,525
was the toughest guy
I ever knew.

255
00:10:27,527 --> 00:10:29,160
World War II veteran.

256
00:10:29,162 --> 00:10:31,997
Killed 20 men
then spent the rest of the war

257
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,798
in an allied prison camp.

258
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,969
My father battled
blood pressure and obesity

259
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,571
all his life.

260
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,073
Different kind of fight.

261
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,477
Okay, he has to be stopped.

262
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:48,079
Please, please, please,
please, just ask Michael.

263
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,750
I don't know.

264
00:10:51,752 --> 00:10:53,551
Ha.

265
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,955
Okay. I'll buy you
a bag of chips.

266
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,423
French onion?

267
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,991
Obviously. Why are
you spinning around?

268
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:02,327
Okay.
Yes.

269
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,962
Take this pen.

270
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:07,799
Go away.

271
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,134
I just have a quick question.

272
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:11,770
I haven't signed them yet, okay?

273
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,438
No, it's not that.

274
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,306
Um, I was just wondering,

275
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:17,308
since I'm probably going
to have to stay late,

276
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:19,110
could you ask Dwight
to stay late too

277
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:21,780
so he can walk me to my car?

278
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:25,216
Come in.

279
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,020
Uh, Pam,

280
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:31,990
but Dwight can't stop you
from being mugged.

281
00:11:31,992 --> 00:11:33,858
He's just not tough enough.

282
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,894
He's a purple belt.
That's really high.

283
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,696
Oh, I could beat up Dwight.
That's ridiculous.

284
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:39,497
I can murder him.

285
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,299
It's just that out there, you...

286
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,567
Oh, is that what they're saying?

287
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:44,736
Yeah, kind of.
Okay. All right.

288
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,272
Where's Dwight?
Uh, kitchen.

289
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,506
Okay.

290
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:54,479
Try it again. Here we go.

291
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:55,814
Hi-yah!
Good.

292
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,315
Wow, it was actually
pretty good, right?

293
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:59,117
Excellent. Now watch.
Let me take you from behind.

294
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,285
- What?
- Watch out, Kelly.

295
00:12:00,287 --> 00:12:02,153
Might sucker punch you.

296
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,388
I didn't sucker punch you,
Michael.

297
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:07,459
In case you didn't remember,
I was defending my honor.

298
00:12:07,461 --> 00:12:08,660
Like a samurai.
Really?

299
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:09,928
Yeah. Well, the offer, Dwight,

300
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,363
was for one punch,
which I absorbed.

301
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:14,833
I had no idea that there'd be
a second punch.

302
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,168
So catch-22.

303
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,971
Okay, fine. Tit for tit.

304
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,041
Give it your best shot.
Two punches. Go.

305
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:25,076
Look. If we were in a bar
right now,

306
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,211
there would be two punches.

307
00:12:26,213 --> 00:12:28,313
Me punching you
and you hitting the floor.

308
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:29,481
No, I'd block your first punch

309
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:30,815
rendering you ineffective.
Oh, really?

310
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:32,250
Yeah.
You know what,

311
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,052
you're just lucky
that we're at work right now.

312
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,253
Ooh, what about Dwight's dojo?

313
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,222
No, they just have classes.

314
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,823
It's free during the day.
It's fine.

315
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,158
I've got the key.
Hey, Michael.

316
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,426
Hey, Toby. Any word
on those time cards?

317
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,927
Hey, you know what?
I have an idea.

318
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,729
Why don't you leave right now?

319
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,965
Why don't you walk
away from the room, okay?

320
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,533
Fine.

321
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,935
We'll go at lunch.

322
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:54,906
Pam, make an announcement.

323
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,342
Figure out carpools.

324
00:12:59,578 --> 00:13:01,579
Um, well, we're all
getting excited

325
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,214
to see this fight.

326
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,416
The Albany Branch is working
right through lunch

327
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:06,684
to prevent downsizing.

328
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:08,787
But Michael, he decided
to extend our lunch

329
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,257
by an hour so that we could
all go down to the dojo

330
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:14,259
and watch him fight Dwight.

331
00:13:14,261 --> 00:13:18,363
Fight. Fight.
Fight. Fight. Fight. Fight.

332
00:13:18,365 --> 00:13:20,465
Fight. I'm coming. Fight.

333
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,170
Sorry.

334
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,479
I recognize that.

335
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,881
That is Japanese
for California roll.

336
00:13:36,883 --> 00:13:38,249
Uh, no, it's not.

337
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:40,418
I think it is.
A guy told me about that.

338
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,886
Actually, it's a symbol
for eternal discipline.

339
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:43,421
Oh.

340
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:44,756
Wow. That is really
interesting.

341
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:45,890
What?

342
00:13:45,892 --> 00:13:47,225
Your love l...
I'm just kidding.

343
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:48,393
I can't see anything.

344
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,295
Look closer.

345
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:51,596
Okay.

346
00:13:51,598 --> 00:13:52,597
One point for me.

347
00:13:52,599 --> 00:13:53,965
Tied up.
Oh, you're dead.

348
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:55,400
What? What are you
going to do?

349
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,467
Bring it, Beesly.
Bring it.

350
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,902
Ooh, yeah. Good move.

351
00:13:57,904 --> 00:14:00,104
Ooh, not such
an ultimate fighter now, huh?

352
00:14:00,106 --> 00:14:01,539
Oh, put me down.

353
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,041
Put me down.

354
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,609
Oh my God.
Hey, put me down.

355
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,877
Hey.

356
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,151
Okay, gentlemen, listen up.

357
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,886
After a clean strike
to the chest,

358
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,988
stomach, or kidneys,

359
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,157
I will separate you
and award a point.

360
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,558
First person
to three wins, all right?

361
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,327
Yes, sensei.
Lot of rules.

362
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,562
Lot of rules. On the street,
we didn't have any rules.

363
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,964
Maybe one. No kicks
to the groin.

364
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,398
Home for dinner.

365
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,634
Hajime!
Ha-yah!

366
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:31,402
Whoa, hey!
What the hell was that?

367
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:32,737
Dwight.
Yes!

368
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:33,938
No way.
One point.

369
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,974
All right. That's the way you
want to do it?

370
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:38,443
Two more! You want to play dirty, huh?
Okay, game on, man.

371
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,911
Sweep the leg.

372
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,312
I'm coming at you, man.

373
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,286
Ha!
Okay, purple belt.

374
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,055
Okay.
I got it.

375
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,457
No.
I got his pants.

376
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:55,593
That was my pants.
No points for pants.

377
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:57,595
Dwight, you have...
No, look.

378
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,164
No, you have something.
You have something.

379
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,966
God, you look like such
an idiot.

380
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,742
Hoo! Ha ha!

381
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:11,776
Clean technique, gentlemen.

382
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:13,444
Come on. Do that again.
Do that again.

383
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:14,579
I dare you.

384
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,681
Ha!

385
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,284
Okay, break.
Break. No holding.

386
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,753
Oh, you can't see?
You can't see?

387
00:15:21,755 --> 00:15:23,955
One point. Two points.
Three points.

388
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:26,057
Break.

389
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,426
I win. I win.

390
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,195
No, you didn't.

391
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,597
No you...

392
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,098
Eight point.
Nine point.

393
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,468
Stop it. No.

394
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,237
Come on. Michael!

395
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:40,538
Open your mouth.
No, Michael!

396
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,092
You talkin' to me?
You talkin' to me?

397
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:03,361
Raging Bull. Pacino.

398
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,029
Oh, I want that footage.
I want it.

399
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:06,264
I need it.

400
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,932
Oh, I have to get back to work.

401
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:09,667
I have lots of work.
Oh, oh, oh.

402
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,336
Check this out.
Come here.

403
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:14,172
There he is.
Mr. temp.

404
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:17,342
Having lunch by the car.

405
00:16:17,344 --> 00:16:19,344
Let us play with him.

406
00:16:19,346 --> 00:16:20,678
See what we can learn.

407
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,489
Oh we're playing phone tag.

408
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,991
Seven new messages.

409
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:34,492
First new message.

410
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:38,396
Hi, Ryan. This is
Saddam Hussein.

411
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:40,098
Next message.

412
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,966
Hey, Ryan. This is
your girlfriend.

413
00:16:41,968 --> 00:16:44,569
And I'm mad.

414
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,560
My emergency contact
is Todd Packer.

415
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,530
Todd F. Packer.

416
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,532
You know what the F standings for?
Fudge?

417
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,236
Uh, come in.

418
00:17:18,238 --> 00:17:20,671
Oh, hey, Karate Kid.

419
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:22,073
The Hilary Swank version.

420
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,908
Hi. How are you?

421
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,444
I need to change my emergency
contact information

422
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,346
from Michael Scott.

423
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,448
Okay, to what?

424
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,451
Just put... the hospital.

425
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:37,055
Contact number, just put 911.

426
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,892
He is such a sore loser.

427
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:42,427
You heard obviously

428
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:45,029
that I mopped the floor
with him this afternoon.

429
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,766
You know what,
um, do yourself a favor.

430
00:17:48,768 --> 00:17:50,234
Just leave me as his contact

431
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:52,203
and I will call the hospital.

432
00:17:52,205 --> 00:17:53,438
Cut out the middleman.

433
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:04,882
Later, Jim.

434
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,617
Later, Kev.

435
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,258
Have a good weekend.

436
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,160
Yeah, you too.

437
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,673
Yeah.

438
00:18:28,675 --> 00:18:30,274
Have the emergency contacts.

439
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,776
Just lay 'em on the chair.

440
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,911
I'll take it from here.

441
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,813
So what you up to this weekend?

442
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:38,816
Uh, hanging out
with some friends probably.

443
00:18:38,818 --> 00:18:41,486
Well, if you do anything crazy,
give me a shout.

444
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,454
Yeah. All right.
I will, um, see you Monday.

445
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,890
All right. Bye.

446
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:54,899
Dwight.

447
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:56,501
Michael, did you finish yet?

448
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,769
This close. Dwight, may I
speak with you for a minute?

449
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,104
Uh, I'm busy.

450
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:02,106
Well, busier.
But I'm making the time.

451
00:19:02,108 --> 00:19:04,108
Michael, can't your
conversation wait till Monday?

452
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,546
Well, you don't even have
anybody to go home to, Toby.

453
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:10,548
The shipping place closes
in a half hour.

454
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:14,252
I know. But I've been carrying
the load on my back all day.

455
00:19:14,254 --> 00:19:17,722
And if everyone would just
chip in a little bit,

456
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:20,191
might help me out.

457
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,425
What do you say?

458
00:19:21,427 --> 00:19:23,461
Let's gang bang
this thing and go home.

459
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,962
Good? Dwight.

460
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:32,670
This is illegal.

461
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,305
I don't care.

462
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,477
I have been testing you
the entire day.

463
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:41,379
Did you know that?

464
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,383
Of course.

465
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:47,552
And I'm happy to say
that you passed.

466
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49,086
So effective immediately,

467
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,454
I am promoting you

468
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,324
from assistant
to the regional manager

469
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:55,226
to assistant regional manager.

470
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:00,198
Michael...

471
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,566
I don't know...

472
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:03,234
I know. I know. I know.
I know.

473
00:20:03,236 --> 00:20:04,502
I wouldn't be offering it

474
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,304
if I didn't think
you could handle it.

475
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,638
I can handle it.
I can.

476
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,106
I know. Okay.

477
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,576
Wow.

478
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,845
So I guess this'll
just be my office.

479
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:15,780
No.

480
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,782
No. Title change only.

481
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:19,317
I'll have Pam send out a memo.

482
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,652
No. No. Three month
probationary period.

483
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,754
Let's just not tell anybody
about this right now.

484
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:25,323
Just a formality?

485
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:27,491
Absolutely.
But not really.

486
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:29,260
Michael...

487
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:36,567
I have so much
to learn from you.

488
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,703
Yes, you do.

489
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,107
Thank you...

490
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,077
sensei.

491
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,482
And ditto.

492
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:54,185
I told Dwight

493
00:20:54,187 --> 00:20:55,653
that there is honor in losing,

494
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,589
which as we all know
is completely ridiculous.

495
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,026
But there is however honor
in making a loser feel better,

496
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:04,962
which is what I just did
for Dwight.

497
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:09,267
Would I rather be
feared or loved?

498
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,668
Um, easy. Both.

499
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:14,405
I want people to be afraid
of how much they love me.

500
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:17,441
And I think I proved that today
at the dojo.

501
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:18,576
Typewriter torture.

502
00:21:18,578 --> 00:21:19,877
Sensei, help.
Typewriter torture.

503
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:22,413
No.
Typewriter.
