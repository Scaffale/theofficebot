1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:05,170
Today is the test paunch day
for the inaugural Sabre store.

2
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:10,634
And I, Dwight Schrute, am in
charge of the entire operation.

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,721
If I can prove myself today and the
store is a hit with the media,

4
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,599
and Nellie sees this,
the vice presidency is mine

5
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,851
Hey, are you
holding this chair?

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,310
Because I feel like
I'm going to fall off

7
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,021
Yeah. Yes. Yes I'm not wearing
the right shoes for this

8
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:23,188
We went
over this, okay?

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,732
Your tiny fingers
make the best knots

10
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:28,277
Hey, strangers. I'm so stoked
for the Sabre store opening

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,325
Hey, my name's Tabitha I'm camped
out in front of the Sabre store

12
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,786
so I can be first in line
for the new Pyramid.

13
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,580
Psst

14
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,541
It's me, Erin. Dwight had
me pretend to be a hipster

15
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:44,001
to create hype
and it's working

16
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,628
There's already people
camped out behind me

17
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,352
NELLIE
Test launch day, people.

18
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:07,066
Now, I would like to fill you in
on a little secret about me

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,901
To inspire you today

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:12,321
Now I know you probably all think
I'm this patrician goddess

21
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,323
But here's the truth

22
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,451
I was born in the little
working-class town of Basildon

23
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,995
and until the age of 32

24
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,538
I talked like this

25
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:24,041
Which was
bloody horrendous, innit?

26
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,003
No, lower than

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:29,797
What's lower than dirt?

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,508
Loam. Magma. Mantle
Outer core. Inner core.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:36,428
Yeah, thank you. Loam.
Bloody loam I came from

30
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,098
when I auditioned
for the Spice Girls

31
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,849
get a callback

32
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,975
Which Spice Girl?

33
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,143
The black one

34
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,106
Okay

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,108
Now think about my
journey here today

36
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,735
and let it inspire
your journey.

37
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,154
Okay Nellie, thank you
Thank you so much

38
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,280
Yep. Yep

39
00:01:55,365 --> 00:02:00,661
Today is press day, and press is
going to make or break this store

40
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,373
And for a tech company press can
only mean one thing, bloggers.

41
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,291
Dossier on bloggers

42
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:11,547
Bloggers are gross Bloggers are obese.
Bloggers have halitosis

43
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,549
You're going to love them

44
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,677
Ryan is going to be
the main event today

45
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,054
He is the pitchman
who is going to give

46
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,306
the feisty yet
profound speech

47
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,851
worthy of a world's fair.
Ryan, you ready to do this?

48
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,144
When people see
this presentation,

49
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,603
they're going to
* in their pants

50
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,729
Come on, man.
- Come on

51
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,731
Okay
Seriously disgusting

52
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,900
Cathy, you will be the hot
girl who talks to bloggers

53
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,486
Ugh! Kill me
It was my idea

54
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:37,281
Packer, you will be the sexual
predator who has come to prey

55
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:40,409
on the trendy teenage girls who
are obsessed with the Pyramid

56
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,077
Uh...
- Ah

57
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,328
That is excellent

58
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,580
I don't see what
that gets us,

59
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,747
but I'm a team player

60
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,999
Perfect casting, right?

61
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,169
Schrute's out to get me,
but I'm playing the long game

62
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:54,006
As soon as he messes up I swoop
in like a sexual predator.

63
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:59,428
Of wonder and enthusiasm

64
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:03,849
as if at the end of E.T., candy
poured out of the screen.

65
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,559
Do you understand?

66
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,644
Goose pimples

67
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:12,816
Speaking of pimples let's
release the bloggers!

68
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:15,944
Morning, everyone

69
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,696
Oh, Andy, guess what
happened to me this morning

70
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,573
Don't care. Tell me later
Listen, it's important.

71
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:20,908
You've got to hear this

72
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:23,994
What do you got?

73
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,954
Oh, my God
Do you have a black eye?

74
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,247
Yes, I do, Phyllis

75
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,208
I woke up at 4:00 a.m
by accident

76
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,084
in time for
the paper to be delivered

77
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:32,169
Guess what?

78
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,881
It's not a kid on a bike
It's a man in a car

79
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,507
Andy, who punched you?

80
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:40,677
Hey, I was on the can What's this
about a black guy in the office?

81
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,554
Black eye, Meredith

82
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,306
Will someone please explain
what's going on here?

83
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,060
Since the interesting thing happened
until now so much time has passed

84
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,519
It's like my
life is buffering

85
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,899
Here's what happened Pam and
I were arriving for the day

86
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:58,570
and there was a gang in the parking
lot, on bikes, on motorcycles

87
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,906
And they just
were hassling Pam.

88
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,157
That's true.

89
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,617
They had weapons.

90
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,743
Weapons.

91
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,454
To talk some sense
into them.

92
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:10,707
But these were not the kind of
people who use their words.

93
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,460
Punches were going,
and I ducked a few,

94
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:15,879
landed a couple, and I
was fighting them off.

95
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,174
It was a totally
like, senseless crime

96
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,134
Thank goodness he was there.
- Good job, Andy.

97
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,223
Any of you wouldn't
have done.

98
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,475
Open the gates

99
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:32,479
There's plenty for
everyone No need to panic

100
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,982
There's plenty for
everyone There's plenty

101
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,567
Don't stampede.
No need to stampede, sir

102
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:42,864
Okay, okay! Hey, hey It's going
to be fine It's going to be fine

103
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,491
There's plenty of Pyramids

104
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,243
Come on,
I was in line before you

105
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,620
So you're
a blogger, right?

106
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,871
Yeah

107
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,123
Blogger

108
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,041
God, stay away

109
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,628
Oh, I always get in
trouble around bloggers

110
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,380
I'm trying to be
a good girl for once

111
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,384
Uh, yeah, I already bought my Pyramid
but I don't want to leave yet.

112
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:05,804
Since seeing Zooey Deschanel

113
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:09,057
at the Coachella music festival.
So fun.

114
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,601
How can we feel safe knowing
that there are gangs here?

115
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,353
We should call the police right now
- Yes

116
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,398
No, no, no, no, no, no We don't
need to call the police.

117
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,400
They'll just ask
everybody questions

118
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,235
get up in everyone's
business right, Pam?

119
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,904
Police are a hassle We
settled this on the street

120
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:26,283
And my eye will heal.
But if the police come

121
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,745
then we will forever stain our
neighborhood as a troubled area

122
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:33,165
Why would you care what the
police think of our neighborhood?

123
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:37,419
Because I have
neighborhood pride

124
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,089
Guys, guys
that's so vague

125
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:43,175
You got to do
the zip plus four

126
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:47,262
18505-7427

127
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:51,099
Look, I don't feel safe I think
we should call the police.

128
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,018
Yes Exactly, we
need to feel safe,

129
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:57,606
which is why Toby is
teaching us self-defense.

130
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,525
Me?

131
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,110
Toby, will you
teach us self-defense?

132
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,030
Yeah. I can't believe
you remembered

133
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,450
I'll go put on my cup

134
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,243
Great

135
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,870
Yes
- Okay.

136
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,997
One of you was Chuck

137
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,124
Yeah, no, it seems
to be going great.

138
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,461
Andy got beat up by
a fifth grade girl?

139
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,797
Look at that guy, he's got
a Sabre phone on him,

140
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,173
he's not even using it

141
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,884
This is a perfect photo
for my daily fail blog.

142
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,887
Uh, I got to go
Okay.

143
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,264
Dwight, what is a fail?
That sounds bad.

144
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,642
No, no, no, it's good
It's really

145
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:36,645
On the Internet, that's a
really good good thing

146
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,439
Are you trying to
sabotage this entire event?

147
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,607
I'm very sorry

148
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:45,404
We gave you an Arrowhead
for free for the day.

149
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,240
How hard would it have
been to do this? Hmm?

150
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:53,829
Hello. Hi, sweetie, it's Jim I'm
calling you from my new Arrowhead

151
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,539
which is why my
voice is crystal clear

152
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,165
and my hand
won't ever get tired

153
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,418
because of
the ergonomic shape

154
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,213
I'm really sorry Is there anything I
can do? Maybe pretend to be Chuck?

155
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,714
You could have
pretended to be Chuck

156
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,591
I begged you to
pretend to be Chuck

157
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:09,553
But you chose to be yourself and
you can no longer be Chuck.

158
00:07:09,804 --> 00:07:11,346
Surrender the tri-pack

159
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,186
You know what
you have to do

160
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:27,028
Point it towards
the store, idiot

161
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,415
You know what I mean?

162
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,791
Pick one of these
buttons and just

163
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,170
Damn it. Take over

164
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,256
Oh, hey, hey, hey, you guys
You must be lost

165
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,300
Listen.
Excuse me, sir

166
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,136
The fountain where you can feed the
pigeons is out behind the bank.

167
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,305
Tell your great-grandson
to bring his kid by.

168
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,474
Okay, so long
Here we go.

169
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,559
Erin! Psst! Come on

170
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,353
The elderly suck the life out of
the young Get them out of here

171
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,106
We are closed
Come on

172
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:06,651
Self-defense is not some
fun boxing match okay?

173
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,320
This is about
escaping with your life

174
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,157
So strike
scream and run

175
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,409
All right,
let's try it

176
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,541
That may have
been my fault.

177
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,709
What the hell, Toby?

178
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:25,003
Okay, look in a real
crisis situation

179
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,671
you're not going to
have time to think.

180
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,925
Okay?
So just remember IAATG

181
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,052
"It's All About The Groin.'

182
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:37,307
What if you're being
attacked by a smallish man

183
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:39,267
who happens to
not have a groin?

184
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,353
I don't think
that's very common

185
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,021
But what if
you're being attacked

186
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,899
by a 4'11" man
who's penis-less

187
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,319
Why are you fixated on this
hypothetical transgendered attacker?

188
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,904
Why don't we
start with the basics?

189
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,948
Show us how to defend
ourself against a baby

190
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,784
and then like
a fifth-grade girl

191
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,995
and then, you know, if we have
time on up to a scary man

192
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:03,333
The most common scenario is a larger
man attacking a smaller female

193
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:08,129
So in that scenario
what if the victim

194
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,423
sucker punches
the attacker in the face?

195
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,885
What can the attacker then do
to better protect himself?

196
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,762
It's interesting
that you're drawn

197
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,681
to the point of
view of the attacker

198
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,684
You would like
The Turn of the Table.

199
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,561
Okay? The latest
Chad Flenderman novel

200
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,398
From the point of view of his nemesis, Dr.
Lucifer Woo.

201
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,567
Can I please leave?
I have a rape flute.

202
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,986
All right, well let's try one
simple technique together

203
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,779
Okay, why doesn't
everyone stand?

204
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,573
Okay, so
you're being attacked

205
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:37,659
you've got your hands up
simple palm strike to the chin

206
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,161
Up to the chin
One, two

207
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,871
One, two

208
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,332
One, two

209
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,587
Cathy, I would like to introduce
you to Fatty Gruesome

210
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,172
He is a freelancer
for Wired magazine

211
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,258
Patty Grossman
I'm a woman.

212
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:54,801
But you still work
for Wired, right?

213
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,011
Yes
Good.

214
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,637
Okay. Flirt away

215
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:01,850
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

216
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,730
Yeah

217
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,525
Yeah. I mean, I think It seemed
like you were a little nervous.

218
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,860
Yeah, no * Sherlock

219
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,528
Can somebody please tell
me something encouraging

220
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:14,696
about this presentation

221
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,781
before I go out there in front
of a million people and do it?

222
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:17,907
Okay. I know!
I know, champ

223
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,909
Just calm down
because, listen

224
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,703
when you are out in
front of a those people

225
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,787
Yeah, what?

226
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,913
...you just
need to realize

227
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:27,125
so much rides on this

228
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,835
You have no idea

229
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:29,961
Dwight

230
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,379
I'm trying to make
him feel important

231
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,008
I wish Kelly were here.
She always knew what to say

232
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:36,885
Um

233
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,639
Oh, Ryan, you're so smart

234
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,432
You're smarter
than Mark Zuckerberg

235
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,559
and those Google guys
all combined.

236
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:48,396
You're so ignorant. You barely
know what you're talking about.

237
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,231
It's so ridiculous

238
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,651
You really need to
read a couple of books

239
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,235
What's a book?

240
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,738
Oh, my God
You're so embarrassing

241
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,866
My mom would say
the best stuff though

242
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,208
You can

243
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,460
You can do it, Ryan

244
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,962
And you know that
I'm capable of this?

245
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,340
You're the only one
who can do it, sweetie

246
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,592
What did you think
of the presentation?

247
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,344
I thought
it was great, sweetie

248
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,846
I would just
fix that one

249
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,682
"Fix" means you hate it I knew it!

250
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,974
I need something
to drink!

251
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,226
Jim, get him a water

252
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,602
No, not a water
a sports drink!

253
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:28,937
I hate everything
in that fridge

254
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,356
Not red! Get me something
yellow or green

255
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,233
from a nearby store
Not red!

256
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,527
Why are you just
standing there?

257
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:38,113
Go to a nearby store and get him
a yellow or green sports drink.

258
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:43,743
Now if your attacker is
willing to defile a corpse

259
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,121
you better stop
playing dead right away

260
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,914
and just make it known
that you're alive

261
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,666
Forgive me
for interrupting

262
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,044
had an altercation
with somebody here

263
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,672
some fancy gentleman
with a squeaky voice?

264
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,799
I think you guys might
have the wrong office

265
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,718
That's him.
The guy I hit

266
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,844
What?

267
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,554
You've got to be
kidding me.

268
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,972
Poor Andy

269
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,226
First you got beat up by a gang
and now she kicks your ass

270
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,269
No, Kevin

271
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,354
What about the lady
you hit with a pinecone?

272
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:12,981
There.
That chubby one

273
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,568
Yesterday?

274
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,570
Wow.
Apologize

275
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:22,323
Sorry I kicked your ass in front
of your "thin" girlfriend

276
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,659
How about we wait until next
year after you have your kid?

277
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,953
You know what? Tiffany's
going to college

278
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,456
Listen I don't know what you
guys are talking about,

279
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,168
but I guess I' just accept your
apology so we can get on with our day

280
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:36,504
God bless. A friend of
mine uses your paper

281
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,756
You do good work

282
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,216
Bye-bye.
Bye

283
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,928
So, Toby, I think we should do a
different self-defense seminar

284
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,473
how to protect ourselves
against tiny little girls.

285
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,726
There's no shame in getting
beaten up by a girl

286
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,853
My ex-wife used
to demolish me.

287
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,480
No, there is
shame in it, okay?

288
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:55,273
We have to draw the
line somewhere.

289
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,692
Oh, my God I think I see
the imprint of a Ring Pop

290
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,110
Oh

291
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,363
Have you seen Erin?

292
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:03,656
I'm on break

293
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,869
Oh, my God

294
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,829
No, hey, bloggers, where
do you think you're going?

295
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,289
No, you got to stay
for the big presentation

296
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,707
We got this
young whiz kid, Ryan

297
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,459
He's like an even
more handsome Bill Gates

298
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,668
When's the presentation?

299
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,420
It's moments away
Just stay here

300
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,964
Hey, Uncle Lucas
it's your nephew, Ryan

301
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,134
Honestly, I could use a
prescription for Ritalin right now

302
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,346
Well, I know you did
one for Aunt Carol.

303
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,766
So it's different
because it's your wife?

304
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,976
Well, that doesn't
make any sense to me

305
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,770
How are you doing?
Don't talk to me right now

306
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,313
I'm sorry. I know you're my boss

307
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,606
but seriously,
you need to get

308
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,066
the hell out of my face

309
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,948
Your little man is unraveling.
Now go and fix it

310
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,991
Sorry about
kicking you out

311
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:50,328
It's just we don't want our
brand associated with death

312
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:54,582
It's okay I'll go to the Costco
and search for handsome men

313
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,501
You're not married yet?

314
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,505
Oh, I was. My husband
was my best friend

315
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,298
He passed away

316
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,427
My best friend
was my boss, Andy

317
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,930
We dated for a while
but since then,

318
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:11,015
he rejected me and
we're not really friends

319
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:16,312
Someone rejected you? With
that body and those bazongas?

320
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,856
Forget him

321
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:22,569
Yeah. Forget him And you
should forget your husband

322
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,153
Well

323
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,198
How long has he
been in the bathroom?

324
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,408
Like 10 minutes

325
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,201
Geez, what's he
doing in there?

326
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,536
Oh, that's my phone

327
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,871
Am I allowed to answer it or
are you going to freak out?

328
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:33,955
Are there bloggers around?

329
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,623
It's Ryan

330
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,251
"I'm sorry. I lied
I'm not in the bathroom

331
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,587
"I can't do it I need to see my mom

332
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,796
"I'm going home.'

333
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,965
What is the delay here?

334
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,384
Where is Ryan?

335
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,553
Why is he not here?

336
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,142
As brilliant and
creative as he is

337
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:57,186
he is nothing
compared to this guy

338
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,521
Uh.

339
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,064
What?

340
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:01,399
That's right. Will you
just give us a second?

341
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,443
You are going to bloody ruin it.
You're going to bloody ruin it

342
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:05,987
because you're a no-good,
half-assed, cockeyed numpty

343
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:07,363
Okay. Okay

344
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,824
Jim I'm not doing
the presentation

345
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,703
Look at me. Look at me
Look at this face

346
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,538
This is not
the face of a performer

347
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,833
This is the face of a scary
apparition you see before you die

348
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:24,964
I'm telling you, if you don't
do this, I don't stand a chance

349
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:27,592
Please, Jim

350
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,682
Okay, I'll do it

351
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,854
Oh, my God. Okay

352
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,731
Go get into Ryan's costume
and check out his notes.

353
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,857
A costume?

354
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,525
Of course
there's a costume

355
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,487
Oh, this is going
to be great

356
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,863
There's nothing like
some last minute changes

357
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,658
to really energize
a presentation. Huh?

358
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,130
Did you pass out in there?
What is taking so long?

359
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,924
I've been in here
for 20 seconds.

360
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,885
Hurry up! Let me in I want
to watch you get dressed.

361
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:13,179
Did you find
the eyeliner?

362
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,139
I'm not wearing eyeliner

363
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,350
You are wearing
eyeliner, Jim.

364
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,780
Time, space, gender

365
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,407
There are no rules
anymore.

366
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,909
All boundaries
are breaking down

367
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:38,037
in the wake of
the infinite future

368
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,667
The only thing that The
only thing that remains...

369
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,168
The only thing
that remains

370
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,671
are the things that have
stood the test of time

371
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,259
Love, values and of
course the Pyramids

372
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:54,762
The strongest shape
ever constructed.

373
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,183
A shape that fits all other
shapes inside of it.

374
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,351
No, that's

375
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,477
Mmm. It's true

376
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,400
This is the future
because this is the past

377
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,570
I've been through a lot
of issues in my life

378
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:15,199
I've seen drug addiction
unemployment

379
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,661
I've been in a relationship
that tore my heart apart

380
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:22,623
without ever being able to
accept that love drove the pain

381
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,625
Yep

382
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,629
When I was 10 years old my
parents took me to Disney world

383
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:36,304
I was not able to comprehend
the beauty that was before me

384
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,561
This is what the Pyramid
will do for you.

385
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:46,981
It is the bridge
to the world.

386
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,983
It has the USB port

387
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:53,279
Wireless will be
available in 2013

388
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:59,660
You can play anything
from Chuck to Cars 2.

389
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:06,834
With the Pyramid, you have
the connection to everything

390
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,463
In time and space

391
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:15,968
Psst

392
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,179
Oh

393
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:26,229
Sabre. It's time
to come home.

394
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,244
All right.
Thank you so much. Wow

395
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:43,121
Wow

396
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,581
And good night

397
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,042
Yeah

398
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,299
Okay, this isn't over
Let's stay focused, okay?

399
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,553
We made fun of Andy earlier for
getting beat up by a little girl

400
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:01,222
but little things
can be dangerous

401
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,392
Whether it's a gremlin
or Chucky the doll,

402
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,645
the key is to
throw it in something

403
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,065
like a fireplace or
a tub of electricity

404
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:13,276
Okay, good point. Um

405
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,696
Good point? What is a
tub of electricity?

406
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,906
With all due respect

407
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,658
we know what we're
defending against

408
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:22,410
It's a 12-year-old
female bully.

409
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,331
Great! I think Kelly
should attack Toby

410
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,499
Yeah

411
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,792
Yeah, that's not
a bad idea actually

412
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,919
because I have had
a lot of pent-up aggression

413
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,546
Thanks.
- Good! Go

414
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,881
I don't know whether
this is gonna help

415
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,257
All right, Kelly

416
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,010
We should stay to maybe some
more traditional models.

417
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,428
You think
you're so pretty?

418
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,597
You're not going to be
so pretty come prom-time

419
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,140
Okay, this is what's
called Take that!

420
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,600
...pre-violent posture
Take that

421
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,894
Not so pre-violent
anymore

422
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,646
I'm in what's called
the decision point.

423
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:51,981
Hey, hey, hey
Kelly! Kelly!

424
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,774
Ow

425
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:55,109
My good eye

426
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,111
Oh, boy

427
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:59,572
Oh, no, I'm not
laughing at you

428
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,950
I'm laughing at
something that Cece did

429
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,662
on the playground earlier
yesterday, this morning.

430
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,540
You know why I
got hit by girls?

431
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,919
Because I stood up
for others.

432
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,795
Pam and Toby

433
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:20,218
didn't care that I was
standing up to girls.

434
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:25,765
You may want to ask yourselves,
where were you when the girls came?

435
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,228
Tough day, yes
But I feel good

436
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,897
I put the office
in their place

437
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,400
took a bunch of painkillers drank half
a bottle of wine took my pants off.

438
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,241
Okay, okay, I will be
the first to admit it.

439
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,576
We could have integrated more
Chuck into the presentation.

440
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,496
Dwight, you're
the vice president

441
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,669
Yeah
Okay! Come on!

442
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,212
Right on

443
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,172
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

444
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,257
Boom
