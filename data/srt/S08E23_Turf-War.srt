1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,089
Oh, man, my delts
are blasted.

2
00:00:08,925 --> 00:00:11,927
A chart for how much
protein powder to scoop

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,388
for a 180-pound
man with no fat

4
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,391
Protein powder, huh?
You cut it with water?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,393
Why don't you
just take estrogen?

6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:20,477
Here

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,529
There you go, boys See how
Papa takes care of you

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,075
people thought biceps
were all that.

9
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,369
They'd flex them all
night at the discotheque

10
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,538
all about core, huh?

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,622
Yeah

12
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,207
Core's critical

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,085
There are four tenets of Pilates
that I live my life by.

14
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,670
One, lengthen

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,547
Two, elongate

16
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,883
Listen, guys. I think we all want
to know the same thing, right?

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,967
Who's the strongest?

18
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,470
There's only one
way to solve that

19
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,097
Thigh curl contest

20
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,308
All right,
here we go, everybody

21
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,268
May the manliest man win

22
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,352
Go

23
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,648
Feast on this, Lewis

24
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:11,070
I love the burn
The burn is where I live

25
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,238
Come on, Gabe. You can't
handle his hamstrings.

26
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,990
You're getting hypno-thized

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,492
Speed set. One

28
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,869
One, two

29
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:20,746
Here, this is for your elbows
For your elbows

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,830
Thank you
You're welcome.

31
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,499
Five, six...
- Seven

32
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,086
Quick phone call for you guys
Keep going. Eight.

33
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,253
Nine

34
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:29,838
Hello?
- Ten.

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,340
We got it?

36
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,302
Very funny, Jim

37
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:36,428
Yeah, Jim

38
00:01:36,513 --> 00:01:38,555
Way to mock us for
perfecting our bodies

39
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,974
Everyone, conference room
Now.

40
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,565
All right
Easy there, Grandpa

41
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,652
Okay, you don't
need my help?

42
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,320
Here, here, just

43
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,876
Morning
Hey

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,631
Somebody left in such a hurry
this morning that she forgot

45
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,092
these
Oh

46
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,927
You know, the only thing more
delicious than your feet

47
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,347
is the feast that I am going
to prepare for everyone.

48
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:24,017
Andy if you're going to
hang out for a while

49
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,102
Uh.

50
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,271
What's this?

51
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,565
This dumb
new rule Robert made

52
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,692
He just wants
visitors to sign in

53
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,694
Is this Robert's
attempt to embarrass me?

54
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,529
No, of course not

55
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:39,741
It's just... I think it's like
if we make an exception for you

56
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,494
then we have to make an
exception for the water guy

57
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,997
and then it's like, "Where
does it end?' So, just...

58
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,499
Why is it when other people spend
all their time at tee office,

59
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:50,335
they're rewarded for it
and when I do it,

60
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,754
"It's a little much"?

61
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,050
Is it because I'm not
an employee anymore?

62
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,927
Because that's
what it feels like

63
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:00,095
All right
enjoy the Illinois game

64
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,138
Good, we have a deal?

65
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,390
Thanks, Janet
Thanks so much, Earl.

66
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:05,058
Wow. A simultaneous sale

67
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,894
And they said it couldn't be done.
Boom. Screw them

68
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,438
A lot going on, guys
What's happening?

69
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,939
The Binghamton
branch closed last night

70
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,441
and all their
clients are up for grabs

71
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,443
That was a fine branch

72
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:18,697
Things are really bad under
Robert California I guess

73
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,032
It's like a festival of poo

74
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,450
Hey, come on, language

75
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,827
Yeah, and we're not interested
in your sour grapes, okay?

76
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,787
Jim, tell him where he
can stick his grapes.

77
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,414
In the fridge

78
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,124
No, Jim.
The butt, in his butt

79
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,834
Sorry, man,
I can't focus on zingers

80
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,336
There's too many
potential clients.

81
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,004
You two better
watch yourselves

82
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,505
Yeah, the Syracuse
branch can't be happy

83
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,090
you're taking
New York clients

84
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:56,318
Robert, why did
Binghamton close?

85
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:58,862
Can everyone just
Please

86
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:06,370
saturnalia last night

87
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,456
in celebration of the
finalization of my divorce

88
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,627
of Australian reds

89
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,672
and, how should I say this
Colombian whites.

90
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:21,260
Wait, what is this
about Binghamton?

91
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,637
The branch closed, forever

92
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:30,227
Closing the Binghamton branch never
occurred to me before today.

93
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:33,188
Or, I guess, last night

94
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,358
But, in vino veritas,
as they say

95
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,945
I'm not going to start
doubting my drunken self now

96
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:46,493
I got your voice
mail from last night

97
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,330
Wonderful

98
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:56,920
And the answer is yes
yes, yes, yes,

99
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,880
and never

100
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:11,601
Pam, when's the last time
you lived so intensely

101
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,855
that your brain, literally,
couldn't hold the memories in?

102
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,065
It was the summer

103
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:18,275
Apparently,
I left a phone message

104
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,903
for Nellie last night, and I
need you to find out what I said

105
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,281
Um, I am a little busy

106
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,574
Yes

107
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,284
Of course

108
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,497
Why don't you list the things that
would keep you from helping me?

109
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,084
Yeah. I can make you a list

110
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,669
Let's do it now

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,505
What's number one?

112
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:45,093
Why don't I help you now?
Okay There we go

113
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,225
Who the hell are Jim Halpert
and Dwight Schrute?

114
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,852
Jim, Dwight,
what are your last names?

115
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,562
And you are?

116
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:58,357
Harry Jannerone,
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse

117
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,446
What the hell's all this?

118
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,240
Cherries jubilee
over home-made gelato

119
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,787
You live well down here in PA I
want to talk to you guys right now

120
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,330
And Lloyd Gross, too

121
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,207
Which one's that guy?

122
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,334
The salesmen have
a commission cap,

123
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,002
but we figured
out a way around it

124
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,922
Lloyd Gross is a fictional
salesman we invented to

125
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,134
How do I put this? Steal from the
company, embezzle, to commit fraud

126
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,595
Okay, it sounds sketchy but
it helps us get more money.

127
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,721
Yes

128
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,931
Pam made a drawing
of Lloyd.

129
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,433
He is a blend of
all the salesmen

130
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,062
There he is

131
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,231
That's Lloyd.
Me?

132
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,024
Yeah, you

133
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,610
Where do you get off
crossing state lines?

134
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,239
Now, we're actually closer to
Binghamton than you are

135
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,657
kemo sabe

136
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,076
I like to think Lloyd Gross
is a no-nonsense guy

137
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,537
who doesn't back
down from anybody

138
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,831
and he calls
people "kemo sabe.'

139
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,958
They're New York
we're New York.

140
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,751
State line is
the dividing line

141
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,545
That's the way
it's always been

142
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,839
There's actually not a rule
that says that. It's true

143
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,134
It's true. There's no rule. You
can check the employee handbook

144
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:09,177
Can I check
the employee handbook, Lloyd?

145
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,805
Does it say anything about me
choking a man with my bare hands?

146
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,974
No

147
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,394
Wait, no? Are you kidding me?
You told me there was a rule.

148
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,563
So many people by now

149
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:23,191
Stay out of my state It's in your
best interest to stay out of my state

150
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,694
I've seen guys
like you, big guys

151
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,529
who like to push
the little guys around

152
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,574
Lloyd Gross eats bullies
like you for breakfast

153
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,993
Stay out of New York, Lloyd

154
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,872
Text from the old wife
I'm going to take that.

155
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,129
How about this, why don't
we just ask Robert?

156
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,548
Can we all agree that maybe
the CEO should decide this?

157
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,049
Robert's here?

158
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:51,303
Look at us,
bickering like school girls

159
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,055
looking around the room for
things to hit each other with

160
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,682
were doing that

161
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,560
Chair, lamp, plant,
table leg Jim's leg

162
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,025
Where's the Advil, Jim? I think
I've hit my limit on the Tylenol...

163
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,109
Sorry, not Jim

164
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,069
Andrew, what do we have
to do to get rid of you?

165
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:11,281
Hire you back and send
Erin back to Florida?

166
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,992
Message received
loud and clear

167
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,577
Just have to get
the caramelized sugar

168
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,912
off the pan
before it dries

169
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:17,996
Oh, for God's sake

170
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,459
Robert California what a
surprise you're here in Scranton

171
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:23,543
Harry

172
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,337
So, why would you
close Binghamton down

173
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,214
without a transition plan
in place?

174
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,381
How do you mean?

175
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,012
No, no, no, kid, stay there
Do your dishes. Go ahead

176
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,389
Harry, there is a time
for every decision

177
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,433
predetermined
many years ago

178
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,644
There's no benefit
in questioning why

179
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,480
this particular
decision seems

180
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,316
so poorly timed

181
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,069
Okay, what are you deciding?
We get a say.

182
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,364
Listen Robert, I don't have time.
There's a big client in play

183
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,990
Prestige Direct Mail Solutions

184
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,242
used to be Binghamton's
Don't listen to him.

185
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,451
Nope I want it. It's mine

186
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,536
Prestige is ours

187
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,912
Okay, they're responsible
for half of the junk ma

188
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,580
on the eastern seaboard
We get them.

189
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:02,082
We already put
a call in to them, Robert

190
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,792
We need you to
make a decision

191
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:05,794
Make a decision.
I have decided

192
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,256
Neither of you are
to have any contact

193
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,677
with either Prestige
or any other Binghamton client

194
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,805
until I've figured out
how to divide things up

195
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,683
As Solomon once said

196
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,064
There's some bizarre energy
in this place today.

197
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:29,943
Robert going off the rails,
making some funky decisions

198
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,028
Like why is nobody
going to call on Prestige?

199
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:33,488
That is a huge client

200
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,031
They could give
their business to

201
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,658
the first person to
walk in the door.

202
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,410
Could be any idiot.

203
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:39,786
Any idiot at all.

204
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:47,377
Shaping a company is in a sense,
similar to training a geisha.

205
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:51,089
You have to mold
not merely the physical form

206
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:55,427
but also the character
The two must harmonize

207
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,638
Are they still there?

208
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:03,435
They want a decision
who gets the big client

209
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,271
They can wait

210
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:10,317
I'll still be talking about
geishas long past their bedtime

211
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:13,528
You know, I trained as one

212
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,823
Is it just me or is our
boss a freaking weirdo?

213
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,369
I'm going to get some air

214
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,962
Jim, you know what would
be really dastardly?

215
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,341
If we snuck out of here
and got to the client first

216
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:45,935
He's running

217
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,107
Damn it

218
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:54,152
What... What is this
supposed to be?

219
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,236
It's a monkey

220
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:58,198
Jim, get real.
This is not a monkey

221
00:10:58,282 --> 00:10:59,699
It's got a hula skirt
and a blue nose.

222
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,201
Hold on. Hold on
Is this him?

223
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,994
What?
Is that him?

224
00:11:03,954 --> 00:11:05,246
It's him! Do something Get out!
Go!

225
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,706
What? What am I
going to do? I don't

226
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,917
Go slash his tires
Go dent his hood!

227
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,837
That's it?

228
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,547
That's great.
That's like a 5-second delay

229
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,799
Dwight

230
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:16,925
Go

231
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,178
Does this thing have turbo?
Nitrous? Hit the NOS

232
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,597
NOS? You mean like
in Fast & Furious?

233
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,890
Yeah. Oh, yeah, I
definitely have NOS

234
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,558
Hit the NOS.
Are you sure?

235
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,603
Yes. We got it! Go! Brace yourself.
Three, two, one

236
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,063
Here we go

237
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,071
Hello Andy Bernard
to see the CEO

238
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,364
Oh. Do you have
an appointment?

239
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,448
No, I do not

240
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,450
Okay. I think I can
squeeze you in

241
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:44,953
Seriously?

242
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,331
Because I could just
be anyone. I thought

243
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:50,125
I was going to
have to convince you

244
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:51,960
He's really not that busy

245
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,253
Is there someone
here to see me?

246
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,587
Yes. This man

247
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,172
Come on in

248
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:04,097
So, what do you make of
this Robert California guy?

249
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,809
What does a guy like that
do on an average weeknight

250
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,019
I'll tell you what he does

251
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:12,605
Hello.
Hello, my clucking hens

252
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,941
Got room for
another in the roost?

253
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,152
Huh? Don't worry I won't lay an egg

254
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,281
Robert sent me to
take over if Pam fails

255
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,658
If?

256
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,787
Crunching numbers all day

257
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,581
Math is for boys

258
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,295
Did someone say "girl talk?'

259
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,133
Sometimes I wonder if I
have ovaries in my scrotum

260
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,552
because I am
great at girl talk

261
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,597
Have you guys been watching
any good Korean soap operas?

262
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,807
I'm pretty deep into
Hee-Jung Cinderella Girl.

263
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:51,311
Although, I definitely fast-forward
through the Yung Tae storylines

264
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,314
Do you think I'd like that? Or is it
important to have an Asian fetish?

265
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,026
I think you're going to need
to have an Asian fetish. Yeah

266
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,779
It'll be
upsetting if you don't

267
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,907
I'm a former paper executive I know
the product. I know the margins

268
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,701
25% on your costs

269
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,621
Why haven't I heard of you?
You got any references?

270
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,623
No. I'm a rogue

271
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,541
Uh-huh.
Which is the best part

272
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,835
That means you will
be my first customer

273
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,214
and your business will get
100% of my attention.

274
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:23,718
Now, I have written down
my personal phone number

275
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,263
You call this any time

276
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,725
Every salesman I've ever met has
given me his personal phone number

277
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,687
Of course they have,
which is why I'm giving you

278
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,524
a key to my house

279
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:45,323
Whatever you need, any time night
or day, you just stop on by.

280
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:49,494
You want me to drive to
your house if I need paper?

281
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,204
Maybe you just want
someone to talk to,

282
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,998
maybe you need a place to
crash for a couple of days

283
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,001
My wireless password
is "eat, pray, love.'

284
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,670
Easy to remember

285
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,383
Ready? Go, go, go

286
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:24,028
You all right?
Yeah.

287
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,586
Dwight, what are you doing?

288
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,670
Shh

289
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,885
Go! Go! Take the stairs, now
What are you talking about?

290
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,053
Just run! Take the stairs! I don't
even know where the stairs are

291
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,763
I'll stall him. Go

292
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,976
What are you doing?

293
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,396
I'm going to activate
the seismic fail-safe

294
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,232
We'll be stuck
between floors for hours

295
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,445
Oh

296
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,574
My pants fell down
What?

297
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,410
My pants fell down
I don't have a belt!

298
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,915
Hello, sir, good day. Dwight K.
Schrute Dunder Mifflin Scranton

299
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,291
Forgive my pants
they fell down.

300
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,752
An appointment with Mr. Ramish,
please Right now is fine.

301
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,254
No, no, no. I was here first Dwight K.
Schrute Dunder Mifflin Scranton.

302
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,505
Hi, guys. What's going on?

303
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,592
Mr. Ramish, Harry Jannerone
Dunder Mifflin Syracuse.

304
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,594
I was here first. Sorry
about this mix-up Okay.

305
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,638
I already made an appointment
with your secretary

306
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,931
Let me stop you
all right here

307
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,265
I've already picked
a new paper supplier

308
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:35,767
Wait, it's not
DM Utica, is it?

309
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,396
No, no, it's not Dunder Mifflin at all,
actually. It's Big Red Paper Company

310
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:41,940
Big Red Paper Company?

311
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,024
Mmm-hmm

312
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,027
Yes, yes, yes

313
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:50,239
Get me a cup of coffee

314
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,324
Me too

315
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,201
Or do you also have
a monopoly on thirst?

316
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,203
All right, guys, it didn't
work out for any of us,

317
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,246
so we're still
on the same team

318
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,207
Let me get these
No

319
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,543
Let him get his own
He's got Syracuse money

320
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,838
You know your partner's got a lot
of attitude, but I like that.

321
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,548
How long you guys
been dating?

322
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,509
Jim couldn't land me
in a thousand years.

323
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,718
But you're saying
there's a chance.

324
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,970
Shut up

325
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:15,807
Hey

326
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,897
Excellent. Excellent

327
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:27,360
Though troubling that your
first instinct is thievery.

328
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,444
What do you want from me?

329
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:32,573
Now we get to the bottom of Nellie's,
"Yes, yes, yes, yes, never.'

330
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:34,283
Hello, Nell, it's Mum.

331
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:37,495
Do keep your chin up. It can't
possibly be as bad as you describe.

332
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,913
Oh, yes, it can

333
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,168
This is MasterCard.
You are over the limit.

334
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:47,213
Send the minimum payment
of $448 by Monday,

335
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,507
or we will be forced to
send it to collections.

336
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,717
Shopaholic

337
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,011
Sounds like it.
Yeah

338
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,556
Hi, sis. Is your boss
still hitting on you?

339
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,811
This is Annie
from Second Nests.

340
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,856
I'm sorry, but the Romanian
orphanage felt more comfortable

341
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,734
with a two-person nuclear
family than a single mother,

342
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,777
so we're going to hold out for that.
Okay, that's enough

343
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:11,529
No, no, no Pam, we need to
get to the bottom of this

344
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:12,864
No. No.
Come on. Come on

345
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,784
Robert, okay... So, I deleted
them all They're all deleted.

346
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,579
Pam, you've
completely bungled this

347
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:20,913
Ah

348
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,211
Hey

349
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:33,384
Can I do it, Pam? Can I pull
off a gold Arabian sandal?

350
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,053
Um

351
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,306
Yes. Definitely.
With your hair, certainly

352
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:40,725
You dropped
your cell phone

353
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,060
Oh, gosh.
Yep

354
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,604
Thank you. I'm so stupid

355
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:45,938
No. My goodness
you just

356
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,691
You have a lot going on
with Robert and everything

357
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,444
Oh, God,
Pam, don't get me started

358
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,862
No, I will not

359
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,030
You've just got me started

360
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:58,117
Robert is a filthy beast

361
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,122
Don't you get the feeling
every time he looks at you,

362
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,666
he's just thinking of 15
different ways to do you?

363
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:06,959
Well

364
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,837
The man talks of
nothing but sex.

365
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,341
Sometimes he talks about
flesh and bacchanals.

366
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:14,425
Oh, yeah

367
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,179
what he left on my
phone last night

368
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,432
No. Don't. Just put
it out of your mind

369
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,021
Pam, what is your address?

370
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,941
I'm going to send you a pair
of these gold harem shoes

371
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,527
Oh. No, you don't
Yes

372
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,738
Come on, a little
gold Arabian slipper

373
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,157
Things are looking up

374
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,623
I have MasterCard
right where I want them

375
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,960
and I have a new friend

376
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,130
A friend

377
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,799
At work

378
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,762
Erin

379
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,180
There's a call
for you on line 1

380
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,141
Who is it?

381
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,643
He says, "Salvation.'
No last name.

382
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:10,815
Yeah, hello

383
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:13,484
You once put me on a list
of the losers in the office

384
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,070
This loser just got
your biggest client

385
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:17,905
to give him all
their business

386
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,700
So, hire me back,
that business is yours.

387
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,327
Don't, and I will
find another buyer

388
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:24,912
You're blackmailing me

389
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,998
It's just business

390
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,794
some ineffectual, privileged

391
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:34,005
effete, soft-penised debutant

392
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,257
You want to start a street
fight with me, bring it on,

393
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,509
but you're going to be
surprised by how ugly it gets

394
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,263
You don't even know my real
name I'm the * Lizard King

395
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,727
Whoa

396
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,817
Well, I gave him a chance

397
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,952
Andy Bernard?

398
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,120
You got a minute?

399
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,623
I'm in the middle
of a piano lesson

400
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,627
I wanted to see if could
interest you in an investment

401
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,753
Dunder Mifflin

402
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:17,965
Dunder Mifflin
Now, why would I want that?

403
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,009
It's worth half what
it was three years ago

404
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,302
Exactly

405
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,804
And you know better than anyone
that with the right management

406
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,433
it could be worth twice what
you would pay for it today

407
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,272
Why don't you come in?

408
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,407
So, what would you do if you
weren't selling paper?

409
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,284
Oh, man,
I'd have to sell beets

410
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,702
probably submit
them for competition

411
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,037
What?

412
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,247
Yeah, I know it
sounds stupid,

413
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,415
but nationals has always kind
of been a dream of mine.

414
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,417
How have we never
talked about this before?

415
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,672
Wait, you don't even
care about nationals

416
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:00,883
Nothing?

417
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,761
I've always wanted to
own a bike shop, but

418
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,388
What about you?

419
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,516
I'd like to sell one
big thing, you know?

420
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,434
Like a plane

421
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:12,520
One sale. I'm out

422
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,398
That sounds lovely

423
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,150
Anyway, Robert's going to run
this company into the ground

424
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,863
so we won't be doing
this in six months.
