1
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,873
Oh, yeah

2
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,169
Kevin! As soon as I
heard that wrapper

3
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,088
You really have
to say, "Oh, yeah, '

4
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,380
every time you
eat a candy bar?

5
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:33,634
I can't help it, Oscar
It's just really good

6
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,886
Oh, yeah

7
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,888
My hands are tied
All right, not bad at all

8
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,933
20 minutes, though
so let's try again

9
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,267
Get it all out
now if you have to

10
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,561
It was a raccoon eating a
hamburger like a person.

11
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,814
You need to stop banging
your pen on your desk,

12
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,524
or it's gonna drive me
insane Okay, got it.

13
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,150
Does anyone have
a first-aid kit?

14
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,485
Check out
this song I wrote.

15
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,195
I'm gonna love you
downstairs tonight

16
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,114
Listen, I say

17
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:57,282
I mean, he looked
like a little Hamburglar

18
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,034
All right, here we go

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,913
Everybody get ready in
three, two Good luck. One

20
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,635
Love letters.
Yes, I love it

21
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,263
What else can be
done with paper?

22
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,682
You can write
a book about chairs

23
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,976
Books. Excellent, Jim

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,270
All right, Andy,
please, please, just stop

25
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,730
You can do infinite
things with paper.

26
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,775
Did you hear that?

27
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,531
Infinity. There is an infinity of
things that you can do with paper

28
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:40,909
Now, who wants
to buy some paper?

29
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,619
Yeah

30
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,414
Very nice
Very nice sales pitch

31
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,416
for our clients that
don't know what paper is

32
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,459
I'm talking about you guys

33
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,881
Who in this room right now
wants to buy some paper?

34
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,426
Let's get high
on our own supply

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,179
Andy, you want us
to buy our own paper?

36
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,430
Yes

37
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,308
Robert said that we needed to
double our sales growth to 8%

38
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,353
by the end of the quarter That's
today, and we are $830 short.

39
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,773
And I can't afford
to keep buying paper from us,

40
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:15,235
so today we need to
sell $830 of paper,

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,862
and then next quarter I need to sell

42
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,989
the $2,200 of paper
that's in my garage.

43
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,994
Animals, machines,
vast virtual armies.

44
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,580
All of these things I have
successfully managed.

45
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,957
The only thing I
haven't managed is people

46
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,044
I saw an ad on
the Sabre website

47
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,796
for an open manager position
in their printers division.

48
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,715
I spoke to Robert
California about it,

49
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,051
and he said for me to come by
and see him some time.

50
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,678
So like
a Spanish conquistador,

51
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,224
I have come to Florida to claim
what is rightfully mine.

52
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,476
Dwight Schrute for
Robert California.

53
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,396
Oh. Hello, Mr. Schrute I'll tell him
you're here Can I get you anything at all?

54
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,023
I'm not here to
be given anything

55
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,566
I'm here to take
what is mine

56
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:58,362
Ooh. I'm glad you're on our
team Here, please have a seat.

57
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,574
Dwight?
What are you doing here?

58
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:05,786
Gabe. You don't know?

59
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,412
Of course I know

60
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:10,165
Hmm. Impressive
office you have here

61
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,919
Surrounded by shrubbery
Like a squirrel's office

62
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,047
Corporate says to me "Gabe,
we need you in Scranton."

63
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,007
Scranton says,
"Gabe, go back down

64
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,176
to Florida
You're needed there.'

65
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:24,263
So Tuesdays and Thursdays
I'm up there.

66
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:27,891
Mondays, Wednesdays and
Fridays I'm down here

67
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:31,728
I can think of no better way to
confront my deathly fear of flying

68
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,939
Dwight.
Robert

69
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,941
You made it
Yes

70
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:37,609
Impressive initiative

71
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:40,862
I don't know what's worse
the trip or the destination.

72
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:47,911
Well, let me settle in

73
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,205
And I'll be with you shortly

74
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,665
Very good

75
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,918
Hey, C-SPAN

76
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,214
So my Dad says an accountant
can really help you out

77
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,467
if they're willing to play ball.
Those were his words

78
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,471
Gosh, Andy, you had
a great quarter, okay?

79
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,017
Robert will understand
$800 is a rounding error

80
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,561
So make that error
Andy, no

81
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,814
Hey, I can make that error Oh

82
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:20,736
Well, it's just I know that making
errors sounds like your kind of thing,

83
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,071
but it's a little more
complicated than that. No, I

84
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,490
It's just I really need
a real accountant on this

85
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,328
What do you say?

86
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,916
Because tonight I have a
trivia contest in Philadelphia

87
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,001
Aw

88
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,754
Any other crunch time
I would love

89
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,172
to stay and cook
the books for you

90
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,341
so you can save face
in front of your CEO

91
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,469
but tonight is
Triviacolypse What?

92
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,846
It's only the biggest night
of trivia of the year

93
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,307
There's a $1,000 prize

94
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:52,434
I'm committed to my friends
They're committed to me

95
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:55,771
You know what? Go. Have fun

96
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,942
There's a trivia contest
at a bar in Philadelphia

97
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,362
Stop right there I love it.
I'm in.

98
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,698
It's trivia.
In Philadelphia

99
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:11,036
But here's the best part
The prize is $1,000

100
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:16,208
and if we win, we can use
that money to buy paper here

101
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,794
close the gap on our
8% profit increase.

102
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,046
That's a great idea. Yeah
That's a great plan.

103
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,548
Yeah? You like it? All right
All right, good stuff.

104
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,717
I'm so psyched you guys are
into it, 'cause I thought

105
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:27,552
"This sounds really stupid.'

106
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,805
You just made a good idea
a great idea.

107
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:31,973
There is one problem
with this plan What?

108
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,268
We'd have to leave work
like, right now to do this

109
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,479
You can reduce
your prices by 10%

110
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,565
or we're gonna be finding a new
source for our morning bagels

111
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,983
All right

112
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,239
Gabe, I always wondered what
it is you did around here

113
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,449
Now I found out
You're the bagel guy

114
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,744
Yeah, but not just bagels
All unwanted problems.

115
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,540
Question What's the most important
appliance in your house?

116
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,293
Meat grinder.
Too slow. It's the toilet

117
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,838
And I am the toilet
of this office

118
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,506
annoying problems

119
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,216
so others can keep
their hands clean,

120
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,094
and just like a toilet I am essential.

121
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,431
You know, Gabe,
you could have gone

122
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,767
with garbage disposal
incinerator, or eraser

123
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,311
And instead
you chose toilet

124
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:20,647
God bless you
You are an American classic

125
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,943
Dwight, today is not my
day at all, I'm afraid

126
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,528
I'm not going to be
able to meet with you

127
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,823
But I'm leaving you in the
very capable hands of our COO

128
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,949
But I can give you
this pitch in one minute

129
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,117
He's gonna meet
with you later.

130
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:34,786
No, no, no. I don't
want you to rush it, okay?

131
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,664
Trust me. Meet with Bill

132
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:41,334
He's a great person to know
I'll dialog with him tonight

133
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,548
CEO to COO What a
difference a letter makes.

134
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,551
Still an important position
Still a chief.

135
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,470
You're really
going to like Bill

136
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,722
He has me toilet
a lot of people for him

137
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,977
Hallway phone.
Gabe Lewis speaking

138
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,313
Gabe, listen to me.
Don't bother Bill with this.

139
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,315
He needs to go put out a fire
on the home front.

140
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,068
Just wait 20 minutes, and then I want
you to listen to Dwight's p\itch.

141
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,988
Make him feel valued.
Make him feel heard.

142
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,448
Your wish is my command

143
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,991
It's a command.

144
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,589
What are you doing here, Andy?
You left us no choice

145
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,299
But this should put
a smile on your face

146
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,594
How would you like to be captain
of the Dunder Mifflin team?

147
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,388
Although I reserve the right
to overrule you What? No.

148
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,392
And you guys thought
this was a good idea?

149
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,936
A fun idea.

150
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,981
There were times on the two and a half
hour drive when I experienced doubt

151
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,067
But that's the thing
about long drives

152
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,194
you know?
You're always going

153
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,321
This is a gay bar
Wait, what?

154
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,281
Everyone in here is gay?

155
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,243
Yes. It's a gay bar so you
guys want to go home now?

156
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,494
No.
No

157
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,578
No
Awesome

158
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:01,873
What does this say about you
that you followed me here?

159
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,041
That you think
you're going to win

160
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,752
your sales quota at
a gay bar's trivia night?

161
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,506
It says that I believe
in my staff's intelligence

162
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,217
and that I'm
willing to try anything

163
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,846
Not "anything.'

164
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:18,723
Good luck

165
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,645
All right, we need to
divide up into teams

166
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:27,107
but it's winner take all
so no need to divide evenly

167
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:31,403
We need an A team a backup
team, and a just-have-fun team

168
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:34,364
So you guys all
know yourselves

169
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,324
Good timers, follow me

170
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,369
Back-ups

171
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,626
Go on, kid. You know
you don't belong here

172
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,797
A team
Okay

173
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,551
All right, everybody,
nice self awareness

174
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,179
Except

175
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,815
Okay

176
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,401
There's a table over here

177
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,570
All right,
first question, everyone.

178
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:17,198
Ray Charles famously had
this state on his mind.

179
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,700
What is its capital?

180
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,201
Oh, we got this

181
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:22,787
Let's reverse engineer this

182
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,664
You're a black singer
Where do you go?

183
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,583
Somewhere where
you're a novelty

184
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,335
Alaska
Atlanta.

185
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,212
I know you think that, because
that's where the Olympics were held

186
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,922
My cousins were
actually at those Olympics

187
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,966
Keep talking all you want

188
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:38,178
How am I supposed to know
what was on his mind?

189
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,347
Ooh! What do blind
people think about?

190
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:45,477
Okay, dogs, canes signs, manholes,
stairs piano, darkness.

191
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,897
Okay, time's up.
Let's get the boards up.

192
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,024
Atlanta, Georgia is
the correct answer.

193
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,073
What?

194
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,533
Hey, man. Uh

195
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,328
Look, unfortunately,
Bill had to go fight a fire

196
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,330
so, your appointment got

197
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,332
There's no fires
within eight miles of here

198
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,668
Well, it's nine miles away

199
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:11,753
I'm going to be meeting
with you on his behalf.

200
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:15,465
What? No, no.
Excuse me, lady

201
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,469
Get anyone from the COO's office
on the phone this instant

202
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,930
This must be
very frustrating

203
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,768
I can see you in
the jungle now

204
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,357
Hey, now, you're not an All-Star of
the NBA, but you did get your game on

205
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,319
when you won the NBA's Sixth Man
of the Year Award in 2011.

206
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,862
Who are you?

207
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,614
Jim, Darryl,
your time to shine

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,700
Shawn Marion.
Yes. Shawn Marion

209
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,120
That doesn't sound right I want
to say LaDamien Washington?

210
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,454
Wrong for so many reasons

211
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,206
Well, I know
Elizabeth Taylor's sixth man

212
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,041
was Richard Burton
Is that helpful?

213
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,712
That's it. I'm gonna go watch
the boats on the river

214
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,422
Ron Artest, Kelly

215
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,173
No, it's Lamar Odom

216
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,216
If it had been Ron Artest
it would have

217
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,718
come up on
Dancing with the Stars

218
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,927
when they pan
over his trophy case

219
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,804
when he's at home
with his family

220
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,724
Lamar winning Sixth Man was a big
storyline on Chloe and Lamar.

221
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,601
All right, boards up.
Let's see who got it.

222
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,312
Lamar Odom is what
we were looking for.

223
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,565
Lamar Odom.

224
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,691
Oh, my God
Lamar Odom

225
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,859
Nice. Nicely done

226
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,696
You're my sports guys You're ESPN.
You're ESPN Classic

227
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,949
Ryan is MSNBC.
I'm E!, TLC and Oxygen

228
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,618
Chill, man.
This plan is airtight

229
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,205
So it's a very
simple argument

230
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:32,667
of why I should be put in charge
of southeast printer sales

231
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:36,337
Nobody has sold more printers
in the northeast than me.

232
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,924
Bottom line, I know
the product I get it.

233
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,843
Well, you got my vote

234
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,555
Oh, my God
Yeah.

235
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,725
Most of all, I believe
that character is destiny

236
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,603
and my character
is one that...

237
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,938
Wait, why are you smiling?

238
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,356
What?
What's with the smile?

239
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,234
You're doing great
So good.

240
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,529
And my character is one
that will never give up

241
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:05,450
until greatness is on
the horizon behind us

242
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:11,498
Dwight, that was a fantastic presentation.
Put your hand on my hand

243
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,211
Flush

244
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,004
Ow

245
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,798
Take me to Robert
Ow. He went home.

246
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,674
Take me to his house
It's a condo.

247
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,759
It's long-term
business housing

248
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,344
You know where it is
Lead me there

249
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,720
Ow. Stephanie, help

250
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,808
Listen, you're
a perfectly fine toilet

251
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:33,144
I'm just an extraordinary
piece of crap. Let's go.

252
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,229
Ow

253
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,690
Excuse me, sir,
on the Dunder Mifflin A team.

254
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,484
Excuse me, sir.
Yeah?

255
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,986
I'm sure you're just checking
your Grindr account.

256
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,824
But you can't
check smartphones

257
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:47,534
during trivia.
It's against the rules.

258
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,244
Okay, I'm turning it off

259
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,038
Okay, you're not
turning it off.

260
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,624
Sir.

261
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,213
Okay, then we're gonna
have to take it away.

262
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,175
Thank you. Thank you.

263
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,762
Okay, I can't not
have my phone. I'm sorry

264
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,186
All right, guys, after nine
rounds, let's check the scores.

265
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,606
In first place with nine
points, it's Aesop's Foibles.

266
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:23,027
The Queerenstein
Bears have seven points.

267
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:25,989
Dunder Mifflin
A team has four points.

268
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,031
All right

269
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:30,034
The D.M. Backup Team
has three points.

270
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,579
The Einsteins
have eight points.

271
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,707
Ladies Gaga have five points.

272
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:36,833
Yeah

273
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,501
So our best chance
of hitting our mark

274
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:42,922
is now in the hands and brains of
Kevin Meredith, Erin and Kelly

275
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,173
Do I like these odds?

276
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,926
My answer is no.
Whoo!

277
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,222
Which one is it? I don't know!
All I know is the building

278
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,809
Robert! Robert California

279
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,186
Robert
Dwight

280
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,983
How nice of Gabe to
show you where I live

281
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,735
Come around, 102

282
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:05,904
All right, guys, time's up.

283
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,740
Who was the relatively
unknown patent clerk

284
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,742
who discovered
that energy equals

285
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,744
mass times
the speed of light squared?

286
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,996
Looks like everyone gets a
point for Albert Einstein.

287
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,167
Wait, except
for the Einsteins.

288
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,419
That's all right.

289
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,338
Which means
the top three teams

290
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,340
are going to finish it
off in the speed round.

291
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,175
So let's get
everyone some bells.

292
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,053
In third place,
we have the Einsteins.

293
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,721
Oh, yeah
What?

294
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,809
Second place, we have
the Queerenstein Bears.

295
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:37,977
Yeah
Come on!

296
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,355
And first place
is Aesop's Foibles.

297
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:41,439
Whoo

298
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,401
Yeah, but they're
going to get clobbered

299
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,404
Ring it in when you know it.
First question.

300
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,532
This man had a fatwa
declared on him when...

301
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,285
Einsteins?

302
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,954
What?
What is it?

303
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,498
I'm just the bell girl

304
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,832
Aesop's?

305
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,168
Salman Rushdie.
Salman Rushdie is correct.

306
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,382
Heading out to sea, sailors.

307
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,593
On a square-rigged
ship, the sail

308
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,845
set furthest
forward is called what?

309
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,057
Princess Ding-Dong
do not hit that bell...

310
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,558
Flying jib

311
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,603
Flying jib is
correct for the Einsteins.

312
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,651
Flying jib. Flying jib

313
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,361
No way

314
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,614
Gentlemen

315
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,038
Give us just a minute. Stew and I
are just finishing up our lesson

316
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,916
Trust me,
one nine-minute bout

317
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,921
is a cardiovascular equivalent of
running uphill for three hours.

318
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,884
I could go to
the gym three times a week

319
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,636
or I can wrestle
Stew once a month

320
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,479
Grab my leg

321
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,065
Yay, Robert

322
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,610
Guys, please help yourself to
some drinks from the fridge.

323
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,197
According to a recent survey,

324
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,201
this is the most common learning
disability among American adolescents.

325
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,662
Boom! ADHD
No.

326
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:22,707
Wrong.
The answer is dyslexia

327
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,542
That's correct
for the Einsteins.

328
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,881
All right
Whoo! Yeah

329
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:34,052
Sir, sir. Dial it back. This
isn't Tail Feathers, okay?

330
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,141
Yeah

331
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,770
They haven't really improved
on the Oreo, have they?

332
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,065
No, thank you

333
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,775
Sit down, Dwight

334
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,155
Let me tell you
why I should be

335
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,990
the next manager
with a riddle.

336
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,161
A manager
a salesman, a leader

337
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,164
and a warrior walk
into a restaurant.

338
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:06,250
The hostess says
"Table for one?"

339
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,711
How is this possible?

340
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,007
You were dining alone
All those people are you

341
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,344
Yes. Exactly. Riddle
number two Who is going...

342
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:24,310
Your drive, your ambition it would
be wasted on a manager's job.

343
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:27,105
And Florida,
you don't want to live here

344
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,689
Even I don't
want to live here

345
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,025
It's why I'm always at
my place in Scranton

346
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,112
Florida is America's basement

347
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:39,951
It's wet. It's filled with mold
strange insects, alligators

348
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:43,121
Alligators are dinosaurs, Dwight.
You know that, right?

349
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,248
Eh... It's complicated

350
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,382
This medal was
my grandfather's

351
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:01,597
He received it for acts
of courage for excellence

352
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,728
It's a tribute
one man gives another

353
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,524
a job, Dwight.

354
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:15,361
But why not let me give you
something even better?

355
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,204
It's a job interview
Not a flea market.

356
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,251
Dwight, the job is
not right for you.

357
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,461
Now, when something
comes along

358
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,755
that is right for you
I'll try you out.

359
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,259
Now get the he
out of my place

360
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,510
Yes

361
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:43,347
Final round.
Last two teams squaring off.

362
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,433
Ready to play doctor.

363
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,519
Our question is about
health and the human body.

364
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,729
Oh, come on

365
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,190
The standard
American analog scale

366
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,734
has a maximum
capacity of what weight?

367
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:57,028
Three hundred pounds

368
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,155
Point for the Einsteins.

369
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:03,868
Here's your final question. Cinephiles,
put on your memory berets.

370
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:08,247
This 2001 masterpiece
from Gilles Paquet-Brenner

371
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:12,001
explores the intricate dynamics
of a family in disarray.

372
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:18,716
Yes

373
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,510
I'm sorry, no.
Over to the Einsteins.

374
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,138
Les Jolies Choses.
- Are you sure?

375
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:29,185
Marion Cotillard
exposes herself

376
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,479
a number of times
in that film.

377
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,563
The Einsteins win it.

378
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,731
No
Yeah

379
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,233
Come on

380
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,655
Look, I know it's easy to say
tonight was just a fluke,

381
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,242
and maybe it was,
but here's a piece of trivia

382
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:48,079
A fluke is one of the most
common fish in the sea

383
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,165
So if you go
fishing for a fluke,

384
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,293
chances are you
just might catch one.

385
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,170
Oh, boy.

386
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:01,676
Welcome to the Stonewall
Alliance Trivia Championship\s!

387
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,805
First prize is $2,500.

388
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,767
Let's just do our thing, collect
our hardware and get the hell home

389
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,477
Whoo
Riboflavin.

390
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,230
Riboflavin?

391
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,398
Michigan.

392
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,362
The President of
the United States

393
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,364
is POTUS.

394
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:27,910
