1
00:00:03,402 --> 00:00:05,097
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:08,606
Who would like an authentic
New York bagel, hmm?

3
00:00:08,673 --> 00:00:10,004
Stanley?
Thank you.

4
00:00:10,075 --> 00:00:13,602
Oh, no, no, no. I got a
pumpernickel just for you.

5
00:00:13,678 --> 00:00:16,044
Wow, H&H.

6
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,174
You went all the way to New
York City to get us bagels?

7
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:21,879
Why? Is there a place
closer that sells them?

8
00:00:21,953 --> 00:00:23,477
This is really nice, Dwight.
Thanks.

9
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:24,579
Thanks.

10
00:00:24,656 --> 00:00:25,953
Oh, don't mention it.

11
00:00:26,024 --> 00:00:28,959
You owe me one.
You all owe me one.

12
00:00:29,027 --> 00:00:30,961
Good morning, Michael.
Morning, Dwight.

13
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,018
Hungry?

14
00:00:32,097 --> 00:00:34,031
No, I had
a fish stick sandwich.

15
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,794
Actually, I had two
fish stick sandwiches.

16
00:00:35,867 --> 00:00:37,630
My girlfriend
didn't want hers,

17
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:40,262
because I guess I'm the
only aphrodisiac she needs.

18
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,896
Fish sticks are not
an aphrodisiac. Yeah.

19
00:00:41,973 --> 00:00:43,770
You're thinking of deer penis.
It worked.

20
00:00:43,842 --> 00:00:46,174
Regardless, that was over
two hours ago,

21
00:00:46,244 --> 00:00:48,974
and it is now a scientific
fact that you are hungry.

22
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:50,446
Bagel?

23
00:00:50,515 --> 00:00:51,880
I don't mind if I do.

24
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,645
Okay, I brought cheese, too.

25
00:00:53,718 --> 00:00:54,912
I'm taking one
for my lady friend.

26
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:56,044
Excellent.

27
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,782
Brain food.
Thank you very much.

28
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,845
Okay.

29
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:01,383
You owe me.

30
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,792
Can't a guy just buy
some bagels for his friends,

31
00:01:03,862 --> 00:01:05,727
so they'll owe him
a favor which he can use

32
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:10,632
to get someone fired who stole a
co-manager position from him anymore?

33
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:14,729
Jeez, when did everyone
get so cynical?

34
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,860
Pam, would you
care for a bagel?

35
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:39,954
Oh, no, thank you.

36
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:43,262
Oh, that's right, you're a woman and
you need to refuse food the first time.

37
00:01:43,335 --> 00:01:45,303
I'll try again.

38
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,600
Please, Pam, reconsider
and have a bagel.

39
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:49,503
I have an early lunch.

40
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:52,569
<i>Michael's been trying
to get Jim and me to hang out</i>

41
00:01:52,644 --> 00:01:54,669
ever since he started
dating my mom.

42
00:01:54,746 --> 00:01:57,579
I don't know. I really hoped
this thing would just die out,

43
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:00,743
but today he's planning a
birthday lunch for my mom.

44
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,480
And we have to go.

45
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:04,553
No way out.

46
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:07,522
No way out.

47
00:02:08,393 --> 00:02:10,520
These are amazing.
You took all these?

48
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:13,689
I've always found beauty
in uncommon places.

49
00:02:13,765 --> 00:02:16,063
Homeless people, graffiti.

50
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,398
Photography lets
me capture all that.

51
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,062
Have you ever been
photographed before?

52
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:21,366
Oh, just by,
like, friends.

53
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,567
Well, here's what I've
been doing around here.

54
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,441
It's for a series on
exposure in the workplace.

55
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,605
Pammy?
Hey!

56
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:32,074
Hey!

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,674
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

58
00:02:33,752 --> 00:02:36,346
Girls, there they are.

59
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,752
Birthday lunch.
Birthday lunch.

60
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,690
There's no better medicine
than birthday lunch.

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,251
It'll cure all of your,

62
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:47,264
"Gee, I don't know if Michael
should be dating my mother."

63
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:50,358
And fixes all
occurrences of,

64
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,767
"I don't really
see them together."

65
00:02:52,837 --> 00:02:54,361
So, open wide, Pam,

66
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,465
and take a big old spoonful
of birthday lunch medicine.

67
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,873
Take with food.

68
00:03:00,111 --> 00:03:03,774
Pam, aren't you going to introduce
us to Michael's girlfriend?

69
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:05,839
I think you guys all remember
my mom from the wedding.

70
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:07,714
Yeah, I think everyone's met Helene. Hi.

71
00:03:07,786 --> 00:03:08,775
Shall we?
Wait a minute,

72
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:10,650
is that another
birthday present for me?

73
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:12,952
'Cause you already
gave me a necklace.

74
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,013
Oh, my God, I love it.

75
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:16,083
Tell her how you gave it to
me. No, that wouldn't be...

76
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,562
He put it around my neck while
I was still asleep this morning.

77
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,859
Nice way to wake up.
- Yeah.

78
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:24,868
The rest of the story has been
censored due to inappropriocity.

79
00:03:24,936 --> 00:03:26,733
Because of sex?
Kevin!

80
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,103
Hey, please, Kevin.
You're fired.

81
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,475
Sorry, sorry, work with a
bunch of idiots. Shall we go?

82
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:33,909
Yes, let's go.

83
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:35,976
Oh, wait.

84
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,244
Swartz Lumber's on the phone for
you, Pam. And they say it's urgent.

85
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:41,581
Oh, you guys,
just one second.

86
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:45,021
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:47,284
Are you serious?

88
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:49,119
Shipping emergency.

89
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,456
I don't think
I can go to lunch.

90
00:03:50,528 --> 00:03:53,861
Oh, man, that's crazy. Right
as we were on our way out, too.

91
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,900
I know. Isn't that
always how it goes?

92
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:58,231
Rarely, if ever.

93
00:03:58,303 --> 00:03:59,531
Let me give it a whirl,
I'll talk to them.

94
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,832
I will handle it.
That's okay.

95
00:04:00,905 --> 00:04:02,668
I feel like it's...
It's my pleasure.

96
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,902
Hello? Well, that's great.

97
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,967
Turns out, the paper
was there all along.

98
00:04:07,045 --> 00:04:08,535
Oh, thank God.

99
00:04:09,614 --> 00:04:12,811
Something's up. That paper
was never supposed to arrive.

100
00:04:13,251 --> 00:04:15,776
So, Pammy, are you
still liking sales?

101
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:17,481
Yeah, it's exciting.

102
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:22,391
You know, Michael
and I were talking,

103
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,587
and maybe, if you
put in a little more

104
00:04:24,663 --> 00:04:28,429
face-to-face time with your clients,
you could improve your sales.

105
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,967
Pam's sales
are fine, actually.

106
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,469
Just want you
to succeed, Pammy.

107
00:04:32,537 --> 00:04:34,903
You know what, we shouldn't even
be talking about business today.

108
00:04:34,973 --> 00:04:35,962
Thank you.

109
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,872
Today's about family.

110
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:41,036
Why did I get in the
car? I could've struggled.

111
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:43,706
I have a whistle in my
purse, I didn't even blow it.

112
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:48,108
Oh, Dwight, I have a
little surprise for you.

113
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:51,121
Let me guess, you ate the
bagel I gave you and loved it.

114
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:52,383
Yes.

115
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,225
And I wanted to
return the favor.

116
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:57,523
I was polishing my loafers
and I happened to look over

117
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:00,621
and notice that your briefcase
was a little worse for the wear,

118
00:05:00,699 --> 00:05:02,394
so a little elbow grease,

119
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:05,925
and she's polished right
up, back to her former glory.

120
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,438
Well.
Feel it against your cheek.

121
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,298
I will.

122
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,343
You give me a gift,
bam, thank you note.

123
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,844
You invite me somewhere,
pow, RSVP.

124
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:18,641
You do me a favor,
wham, favor returned.

125
00:05:20,618 --> 00:05:22,848
Do not test my politeness.

126
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:24,582
Let me get that door
for you. There we go.

127
00:05:24,656 --> 00:05:26,351
Thank you very much,
and I got it for you.

128
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:29,257
Oh! Goodness. Thanks.

129
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:31,557
You know, here's
a healthy fitness tip,

130
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:33,324
if you clench your buttocks
together while walking,

131
00:05:33,398 --> 00:05:35,093
you can really take the
pressure off your knees.

132
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,793
- Is that right?
- Observe.

133
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,394
Right?
That really works.

134
00:05:40,472 --> 00:05:42,565
Yeah. Feel free to use that.
Anytime, okay.

135
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,335
Hey, hold on a second.

136
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:47,674
Do not walk around with
your jacket catawampus.

137
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:49,577
And that needs to be
straight as an arrow.

138
00:05:49,647 --> 00:05:51,842
Thank you very much.

139
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:54,913
Oh, boy. Hey, thank
you very much for that.

140
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:57,750
You are welcome.
Have a seat. Allow me.

141
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,722
Have a seat yourself.

142
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,691
You know what? I am
going to preemptively

143
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,729
change the batteries
in your wireless mouse.

144
00:06:04,796 --> 00:06:05,888
Not necessary.
No, no, no!

145
00:06:05,964 --> 00:06:08,330
You didn't have to do that.

146
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:10,094
Andy is complicating things.

147
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:12,796
But I'm not worried.
This will only up my game.

148
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:16,566
Hello. Scott.
Table for four.

149
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:20,133
Welcome, Scott family.
It'll be just a moment.

150
00:06:20,211 --> 00:06:23,237
I used to love coming here.
The chicken parm is good.

151
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:27,876
Big part of my childhood. Maybe
Michael will start dating that, too.

152
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:30,921
What table should we take?
So many to choose from.

153
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:33,685
Wow.
Oh, my God.

154
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:39,162
What? All I see are boring old
tables with no birthday decorations.

155
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,825
Oh, wait a second,
you mean this one? Wow!

156
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,868
Michael, you did all this?

157
00:06:44,936 --> 00:06:47,131
It's not about taking credit.
Let's just say we all did it.

158
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:49,196
Well, thank you,
all of you.

159
00:06:49,274 --> 00:06:52,505
Well, it was actually
me alone, so...

160
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:53,976
Wow, look at this place.

161
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:55,910
It really makes me want
to go to Italy someday.

162
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,881
Oh, you'll love it.
You can have my guidebooks.

163
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,815
I think I'm done with those
really long plane rides.

164
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:02,716
Thank you for...

165
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,482
Thanks for
lending me the books.

166
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,047
So, Mom, which birthday
are we celebrating this year?

167
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,252
Sticking with 49.

168
00:07:09,327 --> 00:07:10,658
Forty-nine again?

169
00:07:10,728 --> 00:07:13,788
That's nine years in a row. This
is now our longest family tradition.

170
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:15,594
That's funny.

171
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:17,464
Well, as long as
we're running numbers, Pam,

172
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:18,763
help me out with this one.

173
00:07:18,837 --> 00:07:21,271
Let's see, honey,
you're six months pregnant,

174
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:24,900
but you've only been married for 30
days, so what does that add up to?

175
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:28,912
Ooh, burn, burn on you.
And a little bit on me, too.

176
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,039
You're 54 years old.

177
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:32,980
No, I'm 58.

178
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,614
You're 58 years old?

179
00:07:35,687 --> 00:07:36,847
Uh-huh.

180
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,049
Congratulations.

181
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:41,683
The only time you should
care about a woman's age

182
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,283
is if she is
too young for you.

183
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:46,421
And I am not
robbing the cradle.

184
00:07:46,497 --> 00:07:49,864
If anything,
I am robbing the grave.

185
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:52,864
Mom, have you decided
what you want to be called?

186
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,873
I mean, I like Nana, but I
also like the classic Grandma.

187
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,966
Please be Grandma. I want you to
be Grandma. Definitely a Grandma.

188
00:07:59,043 --> 00:08:01,534
Michael.
What do you think? Grandma?

189
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,304
Uh-huh.

190
00:08:03,381 --> 00:08:04,848
Yay! Grandma.

191
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:13,280
Hey, would you guys ever
do a triathlon, you think?

192
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:14,484
Maybe.

193
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:15,651
Helene?

194
00:08:15,727 --> 00:08:17,285
No. I don't think so.

195
00:08:17,362 --> 00:08:19,626
I am. I'm definitely going to do it.

196
00:08:19,697 --> 00:08:22,029
I've already got the run
and the bike thing down,

197
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,035
just need to learn how
to swim. Come on, you in?

198
00:08:25,103 --> 00:08:28,834
No, no. I think a triathlon is
pretty much something I can rule out.

199
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,068
I don't know, it just
doesn't interest me.

200
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:33,906
So, it's a matter of
interest. Good. Okay.

201
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,947
It's not anything you
would have ever done?

202
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,414
I might have done it
when I was younger,

203
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:40,474
but now there are just other
things I'd rather be doing

204
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:42,018
than running and jumping
and swimming...

205
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,520
Well, there's no jumping
in a triathlon. Oh!

206
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:45,988
You're thinking
the broad jump.

207
00:08:46,057 --> 00:08:49,083
Would you try bungee jumping?
No.

208
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,321
Snowboarding? No, no, you
want to go snowboarding?

209
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,091
I might, I might.

210
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,995
Michael, what are
you talking about?

211
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:58,899
Nothing, just life

212
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:05,439
and doing things before
you die. I don't know.

213
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:09,207
Do I really want to
go snowboarding? No.

214
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,477
But I would like to
if I wanted to.

215
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:19,280
What's going on in here?

216
00:09:19,357 --> 00:09:20,449
Andy bought lunch.

217
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,152
Oh, no, really?

218
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,250
Yep, yep.

219
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,819
Took a page right out of the
old Schrute book of niceness.

220
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,058
There is no book,
there's only a survival guide.

221
00:09:28,132 --> 00:09:30,396
You bought
breakfast for everyone,

222
00:09:30,468 --> 00:09:31,799
so I got
lunch for everyone.

223
00:09:31,869 --> 00:09:34,770
Okay, well, allow me.
You know what?

224
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,637
Gosh, these tacos are
awfully complicated to make.

225
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:39,836
I will make
everyone's tacos!

226
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,374
So we should
get the check.

227
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,348
What about your gift, Michael?
Whoa, no, no, no.

228
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,976
No, it's stupid.
You'd hate it, I hate it.

229
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:49,576
I'm sure I won't.
Yes, you will.

230
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,521
He locked himself in his office
all morning working on it.

231
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,558
Give me. Look at
this wrapping paper.

232
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,059
It's got the word "love"
on it in every language.

233
00:09:57,128 --> 00:10:01,326
I literally... I put no thought
into the wrapping at all.

234
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,765
Might as well
have been toilet paper.

235
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,133
Toilet paper. Let's see.

236
00:10:06,204 --> 00:10:10,834
"A scrapbook of our first
memories, by Michael Gary Scott,

237
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:14,275
"for my girlfriend,
Helene, on your birthday."

238
00:10:14,345 --> 00:10:16,939
That's just an
arbitrary title.

239
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,380
Okay, here's a penny.

240
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:19,939
What's that from?
Penny for your thoughts.

241
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:21,747
It was from the wishing
well at the mall.

242
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,915
You threw it in, I went back
later, waded in, and I found it.

243
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,979
That's amazing.

244
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:31,392
It's not amazing at all. It's sort
of weird that I went and did that.

245
00:10:31,462 --> 00:10:34,625
And now your wish won't
come true, so that blows.

246
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:37,600
A poem. Oh, that I plagiarized, I think.

247
00:10:37,668 --> 00:10:41,604
"I cannot go to school today
said little Peggy Ann McKay"

248
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,468
Shel Silverstein?
Yeah.

249
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,065
"I have the measles
and the mumps

250
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:47,407
"a gash, a rash,
and purple bumps

251
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,070
"And my teacher's
really mean

252
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:52,583
"Happy Birthday,
I love you, Helene."

253
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,618
It's really
nice, Michael.

254
00:10:54,685 --> 00:10:55,913
I think it sucks.

255
00:10:56,888 --> 00:10:58,617
I think it's wonderful,
absolutely wonderful.

256
00:10:58,689 --> 00:11:00,680
Well, that's because you and
I have very different tastes,

257
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:02,658
and you like lame things.

258
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:05,855
It's a generational
sort of gap between us.

259
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,558
Oh, God, a scrapbook.

260
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,895
Home run, Michael.

261
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,332
You set the bar so high.

262
00:11:11,402 --> 00:11:12,460
That was a bunt.

263
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:16,399
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight,
I'm going to do this.

264
00:11:16,474 --> 00:11:18,601
Hey, hey, hey, relax.
I got it covered.

265
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:19,870
No, I insist.

266
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:21,878
No, no, no, no, no, I insist.

267
00:11:23,548 --> 00:11:25,413
Okay, Dwight,
this is ridiculous.

268
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,678
Don't worry about it,
you can just owe me.

269
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:30,418
Hey, where'd you go?

270
00:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,921
Oh, I just went
to the bathroom.

271
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:34,389
And then you stopped at
the bar on the way back?

272
00:11:34,459 --> 00:11:35,983
Got thirsty.

273
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,426
Okay, weirdo.
Come on, it's time for cake.

274
00:11:38,496 --> 00:11:39,793
Okay.

275
00:11:39,864 --> 00:11:41,092
Honestly, for a long time,

276
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:43,963
I thought I was going
to grow old with Holly.

277
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:48,302
And then I met Helene,
and she is great,

278
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:51,967
and she already knows
and has done everything

279
00:11:52,043 --> 00:11:56,810
that I have ever wanted to
do and can tell me about it.

280
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:02,312
But I think I want to
do those things myself.

281
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,644
Cake's really good.

282
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:06,656
I know. I love when they
use butter-cream frosting.

283
00:12:06,724 --> 00:12:08,316
Finish your cake, Helene.

284
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:11,627
I want you to
enjoy that cake

285
00:12:11,696 --> 00:12:14,096
because I have something
terrible I need to tell you.

286
00:12:14,165 --> 00:12:17,726
And I want you
to enjoy your cake

287
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:20,930
before I tell you this
terrible, terrible thing.

288
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,711
Helene, I think you're
a wonderful person and I...

289
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:29,643
God, I've enjoyed
dating you

290
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:31,511
and being your
boyfriend so much,

291
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:37,350
but I have to consider Pam's
feelings as a friend and a coworker.

292
00:12:37,421 --> 00:12:41,687
I cannot, in good conscience,
continue to date you,

293
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,818
when I know what
this is doing to her.

294
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,796
Michael. Michael, it's okay.

295
00:12:46,864 --> 00:12:48,161
No, it's not.

296
00:12:48,232 --> 00:12:50,700
I know that it took me a
little while to come around,

297
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:53,760
and it's still a little
weird to get used to,

298
00:12:55,072 --> 00:12:57,905
but you obviously
make my mom very happy.

299
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,577
And that makes me happy.

300
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:04,175
Wow, that just...
You've really grown.

301
00:13:05,216 --> 00:13:07,810
Well...
Oh, thank you, Pam.

302
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:12,185
And I hope you are as
gracious during this next part.

303
00:13:13,891 --> 00:13:16,951
Helene, once again,
you are a wonderful person,

304
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,495
and you have
lived a great life,

305
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:22,294
and I envy it, and I want it
someday, but just in the future.

306
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:25,758
You need somebody who
understands your references.

307
00:13:25,836 --> 00:13:26,962
Who is Kafka-esque?

308
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:29,131
I've never...
I don't know him.

309
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:34,174
There's another woman,
and her name is Italy,

310
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,543
and skydiving,
and bungee jumping.

311
00:13:36,847 --> 00:13:38,041
Okay, so...

312
00:13:38,115 --> 00:13:39,480
And I want kids.

313
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:42,451
And you, unfortunately,
have already completed

314
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,351
that part of your journey
down there. Michael.

315
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:46,447
It's not my decision,
it's Mother Nature.

316
00:13:46,524 --> 00:13:49,322
And Mother has very
strict rules about

317
00:13:57,435 --> 00:13:58,902
fertility.

318
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:01,165
I got it.

319
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:05,131
I'm 58. What am I
supposed to do now?

320
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:08,108
Well, hobbies.
Stop.

321
00:14:11,682 --> 00:14:13,877
What's going on?
Stupid thing wedged up there.

322
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:15,145
No one in this
office will help me.

323
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,652
Yeah, move it.

324
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:19,189
What if Dwight dies and
I still owe him something?

325
00:14:19,257 --> 00:14:21,191
That is a recipe
for a ghost.

326
00:14:21,259 --> 00:14:23,159
Oh, yeah, you're gonna owe me big time.

327
00:14:23,227 --> 00:14:24,558
Looks like a little
envelope, there you go.

328
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:26,597
Yup. Got it.
"To Dwight"?

329
00:14:30,601 --> 00:14:31,727
Starbucks gift card.

330
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,360
Surprise!

331
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:37,207
It's from everybody.
$15 value.

332
00:14:39,277 --> 00:14:41,939
Damn it! I am no closer
to taking Jim down.

333
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,076
What a waste of a day.

334
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:47,982
I could've grown poison mushrooms
that'd be this high by now!

335
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:51,083
They're mushrooms,
they don't get that high.

336
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:54,117
Pamela Beesly-Halpert.
What?

337
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,783
May I have a word with
you in my office, please?

338
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,849
I am working.

339
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:59,919
Well, this is
a work-related matter.

340
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,464
Really?
Yes.

341
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,664
Really?
Yes.

342
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,395
Join me, please,
won't you?

343
00:15:09,674 --> 00:15:11,335
I'm going to give you
a raise, Pam.

344
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:12,467
Why?

345
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:14,704
Because of all the
good work you've done.

346
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,747
I have the lowest sales
record of anyone here.

347
00:15:16,814 --> 00:15:18,975
Don't, no.
It's not about numbers Pam,

348
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,381
it's about attitude.

349
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:23,284
I have the worst attitude
of any person here.

350
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:25,914
Do you want
the raise or what?

351
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,048
Yeah, I'll take it.

352
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,149
Okay, hey. Pam, Pam.

353
00:15:29,226 --> 00:15:31,820
With this raise,
there are strings attached.

354
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:37,664
And that string is attached from
my heart to your mean attitude.

355
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:38,997
You're bribing me?

356
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:42,233
No, no. No, I am not.
Unless you want me to.

357
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:43,432
Do you want me to?

358
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,771
Because I will,
I will bribe you.

359
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:52,248
No, your face is saying don't,
unless I haven't offered you enough.

360
00:15:54,085 --> 00:15:56,076
Your face isn't changing.

361
00:15:56,787 --> 00:15:59,017
What is it?
Talk to me, face.

362
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,990
Tell me what
Pam's brain is thinking.

363
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:04,959
Come on, what do you
want? What do you want?

364
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,520
Do you want a million
dollars? Do you want to hit me?

365
00:16:07,598 --> 00:16:09,225
Do you want me to get down
on one knee and beg you?

366
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,325
I want to hit you.
What?

367
00:16:11,402 --> 00:16:13,097
I want to hit you.
I'll do that.

368
00:16:14,271 --> 00:16:16,034
Okay.

369
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:18,405
What? I don't...
Are you kidding?

370
00:16:18,476 --> 00:16:19,568
No, are you kidding?

371
00:16:19,643 --> 00:16:21,838
No, I don't...

372
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:23,812
All right. Come on,
I'll take off my jacket

373
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:26,315
and tense my stomach
and you just...

374
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:30,150
No, I don't think I can
hit you in the office.

375
00:16:30,221 --> 00:16:31,688
Okay.

376
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:34,224
So, we'll do it after work.
Hmm.

377
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,919
In the parking lot,
in front of everyone.

378
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,159
I'm going to hit you
as hard as I can.

379
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,993
Okay.

380
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,089
Okay.
Okay.

381
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,100
See you then.
See you.

382
00:16:47,972 --> 00:16:49,064
Hey.
Hi.

383
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:51,005
Quick question.
Yeah.

384
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:53,470
Are you scared?

385
00:16:53,544 --> 00:16:54,909
Never.

386
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:57,106
About what? A little.
What are you talking about?

387
00:16:57,181 --> 00:16:59,115
We heard about the punch.
What punch?

388
00:16:59,183 --> 00:17:02,050
Pam. She's going to punch the
crap out of your face after work.

389
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:04,087
I'm pretty sure we said slap.

390
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:07,056
No, it's a punch and Pam has
that crazy pregnancy strength now.

391
00:17:07,124 --> 00:17:10,150
I'm getting concerned that
you don't seem to understand

392
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:12,593
what's going to happen.
Do you?

393
00:17:13,497 --> 00:17:15,727
I'm good.

394
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,789
All right. See you there.

395
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,927
Hey.
Hey.

396
00:17:20,004 --> 00:17:22,268
Do you and Pam ever get
frisky? Inappropriate.

397
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:25,172
I mean, do you ever
wrestle with each other?

398
00:17:25,242 --> 00:17:26,470
All the time.
Really?

399
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,568
Yeah.
She's strong?

400
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:28,669
She wants it bad, Michael.

401
00:17:28,746 --> 00:17:29,940
Can you stop this?

402
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,948
I can.
Okay.

403
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:33,950
And I don't support
her choice to hit you.

404
00:17:34,018 --> 00:17:35,178
I don't, either.

405
00:17:35,252 --> 00:17:37,584
But at the same time,
she goes crazy,

406
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,089
and I do
understand her reasoning.

407
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:42,284
Mmm-hmm. I know.

408
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,350
I just need some time. I need
some time to think about it.

409
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:46,157
You got to do... Give me
some time to make a decision.

410
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:48,790
How much time do you need? No
more than a week, maybe two weeks.

411
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:49,855
Come on, man.

412
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,362
Pam, can I talk
to you for a second?

413
00:17:52,436 --> 00:17:54,700
I heard about the hit. Just to be sure,

414
00:17:54,772 --> 00:17:56,364
it's off company property, right? Right.

415
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,840
Yeah, okay, I think we
should probably be okay.

416
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:00,342
Okay.
Okay.

417
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:05,908
And the power
comes from the back foot.

418
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,844
So, it's all one motion
through the body.

419
00:18:10,488 --> 00:18:14,652
So, there's... You stay a
little low and there's a twist,

420
00:18:14,725 --> 00:18:16,056
and you keep
your shoulder down.

421
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,356
And you kind of
throw out the arm.

422
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:23,759
Okay, wait, you're saying
it comes from the foot?

423
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:24,823
Yes.

424
00:18:24,902 --> 00:18:25,926
Okay.

425
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,496
Yeah. Okay.

426
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:30,631
Hey, everybody.

427
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,302
He's not in the men's room,
although the seat was warm,

428
00:18:33,377 --> 00:18:34,810
so we may have
just missed him.

429
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,141
My money's on Pam.

430
00:18:36,213 --> 00:18:38,977
It's not a fight. What
other outcome could there be?

431
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:40,107
Michael could win.

432
00:18:40,184 --> 00:18:42,015
How? He can't hit back.

433
00:18:42,086 --> 00:18:45,112
Why can't you just
agree with me sometimes?

434
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,555
Am I scared of getting
hit in the face? No.

435
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:50,651
Every day, weirdos pay
dominatrixes hundreds of dollars

436
00:18:50,728 --> 00:18:52,423
for that very privilege.

437
00:18:52,496 --> 00:18:56,193
I'm scared I'm going
to love it. Let's do this.

438
00:18:57,134 --> 00:19:00,126
It's okay, guys. I can handle
this. Everybody can go home.

439
00:19:00,204 --> 00:19:02,172
We're here for
the show, Michael.

440
00:19:02,239 --> 00:19:04,332
You're just
a bunch of voyeurs.

441
00:19:04,408 --> 00:19:05,500
Are you eating popcorn?

442
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:06,873
It has almost no calories.

443
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,275
You ready?

444
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:10,538
Yes.

445
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,445
You have to keep your
hands down. I know.

446
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:17,413
Okay. All right.

447
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:19,846
Oh, God!

448
00:19:19,924 --> 00:19:21,221
Michael, you have to
keep your hands down.

449
00:19:21,292 --> 00:19:22,589
Put your hands
in your pockets.

450
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,957
Okay!

451
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:31,631
Pam, Pam.

452
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,538
I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

453
00:19:35,606 --> 00:19:37,471
What are you sorry for?
So many things.

454
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:39,008
I don't know,
it's hard to choose.

455
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,168
How about for dating my mom?

456
00:19:40,244 --> 00:19:41,302
Maybe that's it.

457
00:19:41,378 --> 00:19:42,709
And dumping her
on her birthday?

458
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,008
Yes.

459
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:53,622
Okay, just don't ever date
a member of my family again.

460
00:19:55,426 --> 00:19:57,053
Okay, I promise.

461
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:00,992
For the record,
your mom came on to me.

462
00:20:02,633 --> 00:20:03,964
Holy crap!

463
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,597
Are you okay?
No!

464
00:20:08,672 --> 00:20:10,071
You're okay.

465
00:20:11,408 --> 00:20:12,466
Feel better?

466
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:13,942
No, you were right.

467
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,039
Wait, why are you limping?

468
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,446
I don't know.

469
00:20:19,516 --> 00:20:21,279
Let's get some
raw meat on that face.

470
00:20:21,352 --> 00:20:23,377
I've got a chicken
in the freezer upstairs.

471
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:27,914
As I watched Pam's big, strong
hand coming toward my face,

472
00:20:27,992 --> 00:20:31,086
I saw my entire life
flash before my eyes.

473
00:20:31,161 --> 00:20:33,629
And guess what?
I have four kids.

474
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:38,557
And I have a hover car
and a hover house.

475
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:41,537
And my wife is a runner,
and it shows.

476
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:47,101
And Pam and Jim are my best
friends, and our kids play together.

477
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:50,374
And I'm happy.

478
00:20:50,447 --> 00:20:52,938
And I am rich
and I never die.

479
00:20:55,319 --> 00:20:58,584
It doesn't sound like much,
but it's enough for me.

480
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:02,181
Good, good, just keep it on
there for another five minutes.

481
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:05,160
It's cold, Dwight.
Let the swelling go down.

482
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:08,687
Oh, thank you. Thanks.
I owe you one, Dwight.

483
00:21:11,368 --> 00:21:12,494
Fire Jim.

484
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,036
No.

485
00:21:14,104 --> 00:21:15,833
I'm cashing in
the favor, fire him.

486
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:16,964
What are you talking...
Do it.

487
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,770
Promote me.
Tri-managers.

488
00:21:18,842 --> 00:21:19,900
Forget that.

489
00:21:19,977 --> 00:21:21,035
Can I have an office?
No.

490
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,840
You know what, you can
keep your stupid favor.

491
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,244
It's worthless.

492
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:27,579
And this is my dinner on
your face, I'm keeping it.

493
00:21:28,385 --> 00:21:30,250
Oh, that feels better.
