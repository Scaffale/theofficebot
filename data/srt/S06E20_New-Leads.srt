1
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,559
Hey, Jim.
Jim! Come here.

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:08,161
Do you know who that is?

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,264
No.

4
00:00:09,341 --> 00:00:10,467
Look at him.
Look at him.

5
00:00:10,542 --> 00:00:11,566
T-shirt, jeans.

6
00:00:11,643 --> 00:00:14,077
Is it you?
I am flattered.

7
00:00:15,347 --> 00:00:16,473
That's Johnny Depp.

8
00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:19,278
Where'd you take that?
In my condo complex.

9
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:21,649
<i>Oh, my God, that's right!
I read in People magazine</i>

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,847
that he was looking for a
two-bedroom condo in Scranton.

11
00:00:23,922 --> 00:00:25,355
I'm flipping out, man.

12
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,187
<i>Well, you remember my idea
for the fourth Pirates movie.</i>

13
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:28,453
Sure. That they should do one.

14
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:33,055
<i>Hey, Jim, Jim, where do
I find the Black Pearl?</i>

15
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:35,224
Who's that?
Captain Jack Sparrow.

16
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,097
Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.

17
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,693
John Dillinger.

18
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:41,467
No, I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

19
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,007
Cap'n Crunch.

20
00:00:43,175 --> 00:00:45,006
Okay. Okay.

21
00:00:45,277 --> 00:00:47,108
Screw you, Halpert.

22
00:00:47,179 --> 00:00:50,478
You know, it's not easy
getting excited about stuff.

23
00:00:50,682 --> 00:00:52,877
Remember how you felt when you
thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?

24
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:53,940
At the Yankees game.

25
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,247
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:57,754
I had a little better
reason to believe that...

27
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:00,349
You're right.
You're right.

28
00:01:01,126 --> 00:01:02,923
Well, you're not right,
because Johnny Depp...

29
00:01:02,994 --> 00:01:05,121
I know. I know!
...in your condo complex?

30
00:01:05,197 --> 00:01:08,997
It also explains why the name
on his mailbox was M. Schulman.

31
00:01:12,637 --> 00:01:14,264
M. Night Schulman?

32
00:01:37,796 --> 00:01:38,660
First up,

33
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:41,460
the Lost and Found has
gone missing.

34
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,296
It itself is lost,

35
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:46,269
so please try not to lose
anything until we find it.

36
00:01:46,338 --> 00:01:48,898
Pet day. If you don't
have a pet please don't feel like...

37
00:01:48,974 --> 00:01:51,272
When are we
getting to sales topics?

38
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:53,811
Yeah. What about those leads? Did
you hear anything from corporate?

39
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:55,813
Ah, yes, the leads.

40
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:58,145
The leads that
Sabre has spent $50,000

41
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,982
to get from a market research
company are not here yet.

42
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,350
- Man.
- But will be...

43
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:05,946
Damn it! No, no,
no. No. Meeting's not over.

44
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:08,390
But is there anything relevant
to the sales staff here?

45
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,257
No sales topic, per se.

46
00:02:10,328 --> 00:02:13,229
Well, then
no Andy Bernard, per se.

47
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:14,697
I agree.

48
00:02:14,766 --> 00:02:16,893
Dwight? Sorry. Michael,
I got calls to make.

49
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:18,936
I would like your
undivided attention, please.

50
00:02:19,004 --> 00:02:21,438
You couldn't handle
my undivided attention.

51
00:02:22,941 --> 00:02:26,274
Over the last few weeks,
things have been changing here.

52
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:30,945
Sabre says it is our duty
to support the sales team,

53
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,610
<i>and the salesmen are
letting it go to their heads.</i>

54
00:02:33,685 --> 00:02:35,346
<i>I think it's kind of
screwed up,</i>

55
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,081
<i>because the way
this place used to work</i>

56
00:02:37,155 --> 00:02:40,352
<i>was make friends first,
make sales second,</i>

57
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:43,222
make love third,
in no particular order.

58
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,863
Listen, Michael,

59
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,034
about what
happened earlier.

60
00:02:51,102 --> 00:02:52,330
Yeah?

61
00:02:52,404 --> 00:02:54,099
When I was asking about
the leads.

62
00:02:54,172 --> 00:02:55,332
Mmm-hmm.

63
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,034
Is there any news
on the leads?

64
00:02:58,209 --> 00:02:59,301
Is that all you have to say to me?

65
00:02:59,377 --> 00:03:02,039
Yeah. You got any
news on the leads?

66
00:03:02,781 --> 00:03:03,770
Okay, I tell you what.

67
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,009
I'm going out on a very
important sales call.

68
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:08,450
You get any news about
the leads, you try me.

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,080
All of my numbers.
All six of my numbers, okay?

70
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:13,124
Including the car phone!

71
00:03:14,926 --> 00:03:16,325
All right, Dwight out!

72
00:03:16,394 --> 00:03:18,021
Salesman is King.

73
00:03:18,096 --> 00:03:20,792
As the best salesman,
I am King of Kings.

74
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,126
<i>Oh, you say Jesus
is King of Kings?</i>

75
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:27,933
Well, what does that say to
you about how I think of myself?

76
00:03:33,411 --> 00:03:35,276
Do you not
answer emails anymore?

77
00:03:35,347 --> 00:03:39,181
Because I have emailed you four
times asking you to come to my desk.

78
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,241
Honey, if I don't have
time to answer an email,

79
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,550
I definitely don't have time
to walk over to your desk.

80
00:03:44,623 --> 00:03:46,454
Wow, wowie, wowie.

81
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:49,392
Congratulations.
It's a big check.

82
00:03:50,996 --> 00:03:52,224
Oh, sorry, one second.

83
00:03:52,297 --> 00:03:53,730
Stop sexting Pam.

84
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,060
I'm trying to
congratulate you.

85
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:58,534
This is actually a big
potential sale, so...

86
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:00,332
You're writing your
memoirs over there?

87
00:04:00,405 --> 00:04:01,770
You writing your
name over there?

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, it's a pretty big check.

89
00:04:03,074 --> 00:04:04,803
It's good, you know,
with the kid.

90
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:07,140
Okay. Don't gloat.
Here's the thing.

91
00:04:07,212 --> 00:04:09,442
This kind of money
can corrupt people.

92
00:04:09,714 --> 00:04:11,682
All right,
here we go. "Michael."

93
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,047
I'm just
saying that...

94
00:04:13,118 --> 00:04:14,244
"Michael."

95
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:17,879
Great.

96
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:21,016
Teddy, nice. Let me just... Let
me write that down real quick.

97
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:23,253
Pencil. Give me a pencil.

98
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,522
Hang on, Teddy.
I'm making a sale.

99
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,828
Mmm-hmm.
Sales.

100
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,925
Mmm-hmm.

101
00:04:31,002 --> 00:04:32,230
There's other pencils
in this office.

102
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:33,634
Give me...

103
00:04:47,252 --> 00:04:48,844
Honey and jelly
sandwich time.

104
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,148
Mike.

105
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:52,280
Oh, you gotta
be kidding me.

106
00:04:52,357 --> 00:04:53,824
Look at that. That's...

107
00:04:53,892 --> 00:04:55,086
I know who did that.

108
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,061
You saw who did
this and you didn't stop them?

109
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:00,654
Didn't have to see.
It was sales, I can feel it.

110
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:02,895
They are out of control.

111
00:05:03,334 --> 00:05:05,165
The sales department
smashed my sandwich.

112
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:07,295
Yes. All of them.

113
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:09,237
Together.
It's a conspiracy.

114
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,097
Listen to me, Mike.

115
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:13,235
You gotta do
something about them.

116
00:05:13,311 --> 00:05:14,335
You don't get it.

117
00:05:14,412 --> 00:05:16,937
You need to get back on top.

118
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,847
That's what she said.
That's what she said.

119
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:21,317
Yeah.
Yeah.

120
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:25,253
Something came
for you, Michael.

121
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:26,449
Thank you very much.

122
00:05:26,524 --> 00:05:27,923
What'd you get?

123
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:29,857
Uh, it's just the stupid
leads. JIM: All right!

124
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:31,828
About time.
Yeah! Me likey!

125
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:34,763
Yeah, finally, Michael.
Hand them over, numbnuts.

126
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:39,100
But seriously, I mean, it's
your job to give us those leads.

127
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,501
All right.

128
00:05:40,972 --> 00:05:43,907
Then I guess I should
give them out. Hold on.

129
00:05:45,677 --> 00:05:47,542
You know what I'm thinking?

130
00:05:47,612 --> 00:05:50,012
I'm thinking that I have
something that you want.

131
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,379
You guys are acting
like you own this place,

132
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,644
and you don't.

133
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:56,585
Not even Sabre owns
this place. It's a rental.

134
00:05:56,654 --> 00:05:58,417
I'm kind of sick of
the attitude around here.

135
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,355
I'm sick of
the cocky walk.

136
00:06:00,425 --> 00:06:04,327
I am sick of you throwing
your paycheck in my face.

137
00:06:04,629 --> 00:06:07,325
I am sick of your
uppity attitude, Jim.

138
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,700
I think I am not going
to give these to you.

139
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,068
- Yes!
- Yeah!

140
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,766
We need those leads, Michael.

141
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,570
That's our job,
Michael. Michael!

142
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,907
<i>Michael, we spent
a lot of money on those leads.</i>

143
00:06:23,982 --> 00:06:25,040
<i>You have to
give them out.</i>

144
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:27,641
Then we are just rewarding
their bad behavior.

145
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:30,586
Okay, just imagine

146
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,852
that instead of going to
jail for murdering someone,

147
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,227
you got an ice cream cone.

148
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:38,990
If that were the case,
then in the summertime,

149
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,726
everyone would go
around killing people

150
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:46,032
for the pleasure
of an ice cream cone.

151
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:49,164
<i>Michael, I don't want
to incentivize murder,</i>

152
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,969
<i>but we've tried
to make it clear</i>

153
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,374
<i>that our policy
emphasizes sales staff.</i>

154
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:55,708
They act like
I have no power.

155
00:06:55,914 --> 00:06:57,711
<i>But you do.
You are in charge...</i>

156
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:59,477
<i>Thank you... Of
supporting the sales staff.</i>

157
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:01,314
<i>You are required to hand
out those leads, Michael.</i>

158
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:02,512
Mmm-hmm.

159
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:06,421
Well, if that is what I am required
to do, I will do exactly that.

160
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:08,186
<i>Okay, good.
Exactly that.</i>

161
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:10,022
<i>Good.
Exactly that.</i>

162
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:11,493
<i>Why do you
keep repeating...</i>

163
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,825
Hello. May I have
everyone's attention, please?

164
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:19,160
Gabe has instructed me
to hand out the leads,

165
00:07:19,237 --> 00:07:22,866
so I am going to give
the leads to King Creed.

166
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,132
What?
What are you...

167
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:27,144
And to King Meredith!

168
00:07:27,212 --> 00:07:28,509
They aren't
sales people.

169
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,741
And to King Angela.

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,182
Because today we are
all kings and queens.

171
00:07:34,786 --> 00:07:36,276
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

172
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,845
I am giving them
the leads, Phyllis.

173
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,524
Hey.
Hey.

174
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:47,892
So I'm gonna go ahead
and save you some time,

175
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,992
and tell you that no one's
gonna go along with this.

176
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:52,195
But you knew that, right?

177
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,294
Mmm-hmm.

178
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:57,330
All right. So, why don't you just
give me my share of the leads,

179
00:07:57,675 --> 00:07:59,700
and I'll start
making some calls?

180
00:07:59,777 --> 00:08:00,869
Okay.

181
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:06,373
Hey, all right.
All right.

182
00:08:09,554 --> 00:08:11,351
These aren't leads.
What are they?

183
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:13,913
Oh, right.
Those are clues,

184
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,892
and within each clue
is a lesson.

185
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,451
You learn a lesson,
and then you find a lead.

186
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:22,021
The leads are scattered
all over the industrial park.

187
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,092
I'm trying to make
your kids respect you,

188
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,502
because a father needs
to respect his boss,

189
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:31,906
and kids don't respect the father
who doesn't respect the boss.

190
00:08:31,976 --> 00:08:33,443
Do you understand
that line of logic?

191
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:34,739
I don't even think
you understand it.

192
00:08:34,812 --> 00:08:36,541
I do understand it.

193
00:08:37,382 --> 00:08:38,849
This one's a map.

194
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:39,906
Or is it?

195
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:47,353
How the tables have turned!
I see you got my email.

196
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,160
Are you gonna give me the leads or not?

197
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:53,720
I'll give you the leads.
But you know what?

198
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:57,200
It's gonna cost you
some clerical work.

199
00:08:57,268 --> 00:08:59,395
What are these for?
It doesn't matter.

200
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,028
Fill them out.
All of them.

201
00:09:01,105 --> 00:09:03,471
And when you're done, you
can watch me shred them.

202
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:04,940
Right.

203
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,943
<i>I want to watch
The Kardashians, okay?</i>

204
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:08,672
<i>I don't want to watch Bored
To Death. It's mindless!</i>

205
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:09,974
<i>Kardashians is a good show.
It is...</i>

206
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,106
Thank you, Stanley!
No, you don't even know!

207
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:12,547
<i>How would he even
know The Kardashians?</i>

208
00:09:12,617 --> 00:09:14,915
It's about a family, a real-life
family. No, Stanley, do you...

209
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:16,744
<i>Hey, baby, what's up?</i>

210
00:09:16,821 --> 00:09:19,585
I am currently reading
incoherent riddles

211
00:09:19,657 --> 00:09:22,524
on blue index cards
to find vital information

212
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:26,290
that Michael has hidden all
over the office. How are you?

213
00:09:26,664 --> 00:09:29,326
<i>Nothing but vomit
and diapers over here.</i>

214
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,459
Oh, my God.
I couldn't envy you more.

215
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:34,699
Having a baby is as
exhausting as they say it is.

216
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:37,907
Having two babies,
that's just unfair.

217
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:39,942
How about this one?

218
00:09:40,011 --> 00:09:42,673
"When arrogant salesmen
are mean to my face,

219
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,614
"a certain manager will
go to his moppy place."

220
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,412
<i>He means
his mopey place.</i>

221
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:50,386
<i>It's under that street lamp
that he thinks was in Casablanca.</i>

222
00:09:50,455 --> 00:09:51,513
God, I love you.

223
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:55,622
Today I turned an office
crisis into a teachable moment.

224
00:09:56,027 --> 00:10:00,623
<i>A lesser manager would have
screwed this day up royally.</i>

225
00:10:00,698 --> 00:10:03,758
<i>I can imagine some yokel
sitting behind his desk saying,</i>

226
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,668
<i>"Oh, yeah, take a lead. Learn nothing."</i>

227
00:10:06,738 --> 00:10:09,036
Some people shouldn't
be in this business.

228
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:14,036
Hey. I guess you probably
won't give me your leads

229
00:10:14,112 --> 00:10:15,704
since I'm a jerk salesman.

230
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,340
Yeah. I basically
wish you were dead.

231
00:10:19,751 --> 00:10:20,945
I hid the leads.

232
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,179
Where?

233
00:10:28,326 --> 00:10:29,520
Colder.

234
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,729
Colder.

235
00:10:36,701 --> 00:10:37,895
Warmer.

236
00:10:39,504 --> 00:10:40,698
Warmer.

237
00:10:41,606 --> 00:10:45,007
Colder. Colder. Warmer.

238
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,575
Warmer. Warmer!

239
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,577
Hot! Hotter.

240
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,710
Burning hot! Lower.

241
00:10:55,353 --> 00:10:56,650
Are you...
Lower.

242
00:10:56,721 --> 00:10:58,188
Are you sure?

243
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,681
Lower.

244
00:11:07,065 --> 00:11:08,589
What are you doing, idiot?

245
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,725
Michael's stupid
scavenger hunt.

246
00:11:10,802 --> 00:11:13,862
Scavenger hunt? Here.
I can solve it. Give it.

247
00:11:14,672 --> 00:11:16,196
"The treasure you seek
is in the parking lot

248
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:18,333
"under the first president"?

249
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,637
Lincoln.

250
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:23,074
The prankster
is getting pranked.

251
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,012
It involves you, too.

252
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:27,640
The leads are in?

253
00:11:28,886 --> 00:11:30,114
Michael?

254
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:33,216
Michael, you were supposed to
tell me when the leads came in.

255
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,352
Well, big shot, if you
want to find your leads,

256
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:39,794
go to the man
who never breeds.

257
00:11:41,099 --> 00:11:42,088
Kevin.

258
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:43,394
Damn it!

259
00:11:43,468 --> 00:11:46,403
Kevin! Give me those leads.
Where are they? Come on!

260
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:48,439
You are never
going to find them.

261
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,701
Really?
I'm going to enjoy this.

262
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:52,709
Give me the leads!
Where are my leads?

263
00:11:52,777 --> 00:11:53,766
Give me the leads!

264
00:11:53,845 --> 00:11:55,073
I'm still enjoying it!

265
00:11:55,146 --> 00:11:56,374
Where are they?

266
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,881
They're in the trash.
They're in the trash.

267
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,981
The trash. It's code.

268
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:04,714
All right, Meredith.
Take off your dress.

269
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:05,813
Okey-dokey.

270
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,084
No, dear God, no.

271
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:09,592
It's in the trashcan.
In the kitchen.

272
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,195
It's coming off
either way.

273
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:23,171
Clean sack.

274
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:25,808
What...
I emptied it in the dumpster.

275
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:28,004
It had Toby's baba ghanoush.

276
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:31,839
If we don't patronize the
only Syrian restaurant in town,

277
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:35,477
there'll be nothing left
but pan pizzas

278
00:12:35,553 --> 00:12:37,646
and, you know,
make-your-own-salads.

279
00:12:44,362 --> 00:12:45,351
It's empty!

280
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:46,657
Wait. What day is today?

281
00:12:46,731 --> 00:12:49,495
<i>Tonight is Ghost Whisperer,
so Friday.</i>

282
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:54,027
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! No, no, no!

283
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:56,601
Hey, hey!

284
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,670
Wait! Wait!

285
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:04,604
Okay, you know what? Let's just
go to the dump, start looking.

286
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:06,809
Ryan, come on.
Shotgun in my car.

287
00:13:06,884 --> 00:13:08,715
Michael, why would
we all go to the dump?

288
00:13:08,786 --> 00:13:11,277
Why? Because I am
not going to call Sabre

289
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:15,291
and say, "Hi! You know those
very valuable, expensive leads

290
00:13:15,359 --> 00:13:16,986
"that you gave us
earlier today?

291
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:18,824
"Well, because of a screw-up
by a staff member,

292
00:13:18,896 --> 00:13:20,227
"they're now
in the city dump."

293
00:13:20,298 --> 00:13:22,493
Not your staff, Michael. You.

294
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:24,194
Well, that's not the way
it's gonna sound.

295
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:26,634
Here's what we'll do. We'll go
to the dump, we'll look around,

296
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,399
then we'll all go
out and get pizza,

297
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,667
maybe catch a movie,
late-night drink,

298
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,140
some more pizza, call it
a night. What do you...

299
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,077
Does it have to be pizza?
Could we go for a falafel?

300
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:36,135
Really?

301
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:38,307
I'm not going.
You did this, not us.

302
00:13:38,382 --> 00:13:42,614
Okay, no. You encouraged it.
You were complicit. Complicit.

303
00:13:43,421 --> 00:13:44,513
You were all successories.

304
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:46,557
That sounds fun, mucking
around in the dump.

305
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:48,023
I wish I could go.
You can.

306
00:13:48,092 --> 00:13:50,083
I can't.
You know that.

307
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,527
Okay, fine, I get it.
I'll just go by myself.

308
00:13:52,964 --> 00:13:54,295
I'll go, Michael.

309
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,662
'Cause you'll just
screw it up.

310
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:14,110
This place has gone to hell.

311
00:14:18,155 --> 00:14:20,282
You know, Dwight, there was a
time you'd be pinching yourself

312
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:23,259
to have the opportunity to
look through a dump with me.

313
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,352
Yeah, well,
the acorn becomes the oak.

314
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:29,160
Yeah. Well, sometimes the
acorn just stays an acorn.

315
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:30,860
If you don't believe me,
look in my gutters.

316
00:14:31,035 --> 00:14:33,765
You're adorable.
You need to go for it.

317
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:37,035
I'm gonna be, like, mad at you
if you don't... Yeah, whatever.

318
00:14:40,344 --> 00:14:42,244
Can't wait
for this day to be over.

319
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:44,247
Why?
Just all the drama.

320
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:45,680
What drama?

321
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,240
Between the...

322
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:49,577
Us and you guys.

323
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:51,979
It's unnecessary, right?

324
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:53,080
So unnecessary.

325
00:14:53,157 --> 00:14:55,387
Good. Thank God you said that.

326
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,157
You know,
maybe if the salesmen

327
00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,059
weren't acting like such
a bunch of stuck-up losers,

328
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,531
then this day wouldn't be so
bad. Did you ever think of that?

329
00:15:04,402 --> 00:15:06,393
I have new
baby pictures.

330
00:15:06,470 --> 00:15:07,562
Jim.

331
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,641
Don't use your cute
baby to make us like you.

332
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:13,176
She's wearing a Onesie.

333
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,239
Stop it.

334
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:19,414
If we act nice now,

335
00:15:19,483 --> 00:15:21,883
then we're rewarding them
for treating us poorly.

336
00:15:21,952 --> 00:15:23,010
Didn't we kind of start it?

337
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:24,884
Mmm. I think you're
remembering that wrong.

338
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:26,115
Yeah. PHYLLIS: I
don't know about this.

339
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,919
I mean, I think we
should hold our ground.

340
00:15:27,992 --> 00:15:30,586
The company's changed, and if
they don't like it, they can leave.

341
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:33,926
I mean, a lot of their
work can be done from India.

342
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,397
Can we at least all agree
that this is uncomfortable,

343
00:15:36,467 --> 00:15:38,992
and maybe heading
for something bad?

344
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:40,902
All those who agree
say "aye."

345
00:15:40,971 --> 00:15:42,029
Aye.

346
00:15:42,106 --> 00:15:43,971
All those opposed? I don't
think we need opposed.

347
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,772
You've changed, man.

348
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:50,009
Oh, why, 'cause I have a
shot at a 100K commission?

349
00:15:50,081 --> 00:15:52,549
Since when do you
care about money?

350
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:54,641
When I first met you,
you were a wide-eyed innocent.

351
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,949
Hey, there is nothing I can
do about my wide-set eyes.

352
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:59,285
No, no, no, I'm talking about
your personality, Dwight!

353
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,793
Okay, when I first met you,
I had a lot of job offers.

354
00:16:03,027 --> 00:16:06,326
And I had an offer
from lvan Schotsky.

355
00:16:06,397 --> 00:16:09,127
The lvan Schotsky. If I
had assistant managed him...

356
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,224
Assistant to
the managed him.

357
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:12,030
Oh, that's low!

358
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,594
I would be number two
right now at a Home Depot!

359
00:16:14,672 --> 00:16:15,661
Yeah.
Okay?

360
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,367
'Cause they promote
from within!

361
00:16:17,441 --> 00:16:19,841
Instead I had to follow you.
You're going nowhere.

362
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,606
You think you would have done
better without me. Really?

363
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,342
I hitched my wagon
to a horse with no legs.

364
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:29,546
Wow! Okay! Man!

365
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:33,181
When I think
about all the time

366
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:35,748
that I wasted
being your friend!

367
00:16:35,826 --> 00:16:37,088
I shouldn't have
been hanging out

368
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,594
watching karate
movies with you!

369
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:39,924
Kung fu movies!

370
00:16:39,997 --> 00:16:41,123
You know what I should have been doing?

371
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:43,894
I should have been out at
bars finding my soul mate,

372
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,629
finding my wife,
making babies.

373
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:48,695
Nice babies you're making
with the floozies at the bars!

374
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:50,638
That's my wife you're
talking about, man!

375
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:53,609
Your made-up wife
who doesn't exist?

376
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:56,370
You watch it!

377
00:16:56,447 --> 00:17:00,941
If I'd wanted to hit you, I would
have hit you. Don't do it! No, no.

378
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:04,514
You just made an enemy
with the wrong guy, Dwight.

379
00:17:09,894 --> 00:17:12,226
Wait. Timeout,
timeout, timeout!

380
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,900
Time-in.
No!

381
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,163
Don't... Don't even
think about that.

382
00:17:26,677 --> 00:17:27,905
Stop it!

383
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,572
Give me that.
That's my spool!

384
00:17:31,782 --> 00:17:34,182
What's the least we can do
to make this okay?

385
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:36,048
I'll text Pam. She's
really good at this stuff.

386
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,180
Yeah. I'll text Erin. She's
really good at this stuff, too.

387
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:43,082
I mean, I guess we could give
them some of our new commissions.

388
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,219
That is
a dangerous precedent.

389
00:17:45,296 --> 00:17:47,594
Pam texted back saying we
could give them all iPods.

390
00:17:47,665 --> 00:17:50,793
If they don't have an iPod by
now, they really don't want one.

391
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:53,393
All right. Then we're back to cash.

392
00:17:53,971 --> 00:17:55,029
And I gotta say,

393
00:17:55,105 --> 00:17:57,005
if giving a small
percentage of our commissions

394
00:17:57,074 --> 00:17:59,065
is gonna smooth all
this over, I'm for it.

395
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:01,043
Okay, fine,
cash it is.

396
00:18:01,111 --> 00:18:02,669
Erin just texted me back.

397
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:05,237
"People love shells
from faraway beaches."

398
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,015
Okay, Dwight.
All right, Dwight.

399
00:18:10,087 --> 00:18:13,284
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, God!

400
00:18:13,357 --> 00:18:14,346
Oh.

401
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,903
We're never gonna find
those leads, are we?

402
00:18:31,976 --> 00:18:33,034
No.

403
00:18:44,788 --> 00:18:46,449
Amazing, isn't it?

404
00:18:47,258 --> 00:18:50,056
No other animal on Earth
could do this.

405
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:53,153
Maybe beavers.
But not like this.

406
00:18:57,067 --> 00:19:00,730
So, how about, guys, 1%
commission a month instead of 2%?

407
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:01,930
What do you think...
No.

408
00:19:02,006 --> 00:19:03,906
No, we agreed 2% for the quarter. Yes.

409
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:06,340
Okay. Hey, everybody.

410
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,934
Nice spread. We get it.

411
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,071
You eat like royalty.
No, no.

412
00:19:10,147 --> 00:19:12,547
This is a representation
of how we feel,

413
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:14,880
and how we feel
is really sorry.

414
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:17,614
Yeah. We wanted to bring you
in and make a peace offering.

415
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:20,953
Yeah, we wanted to
do the right thing, so...

416
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:23,622
Way to go, guys.
This...

417
00:19:24,662 --> 00:19:26,061
This was an
integrity move.

418
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:28,325
Yeah. When we
walked in here,

419
00:19:28,566 --> 00:19:31,399
we were all prepared
to tell you to go to hell.

420
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:33,060
Do you have any pastries without fruit?

421
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:35,833
Yes, we do. Eclairs.

422
00:19:38,075 --> 00:19:40,407
Well, you better be
happy, taking 2% of our...

423
00:19:40,477 --> 00:19:42,945
2% milk! What I forgot for the coffee.

424
00:19:43,013 --> 00:19:44,037
Yeah, treats, Stanley.

425
00:19:44,114 --> 00:19:46,105
They've accepted our
simple offer of treats only,

426
00:19:46,183 --> 00:19:47,411
nothing more.

427
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:53,722
This is nice.
All of us back together.

428
00:19:54,658 --> 00:19:55,920
This?

429
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,554
Why would somebody
throw that out?

430
00:19:57,628 --> 00:19:59,562
Waste.

431
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,858
Hey.

432
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:07,202
You know who'd
like this? Phyllis.

433
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,493
Purple much?

434
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:09,698
Yeah, she does.

435
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:13,171
She loves purple.
Does it stink?

436
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:14,969
Yeah.

437
00:20:16,046 --> 00:20:18,571
You know what would be
a great picture here?

438
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:22,016
Just this whole dump, and
in the middle, one flower.

439
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:23,451
Mmm-hmm.
That's it.

440
00:20:24,054 --> 00:20:25,112
Wow.

441
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:28,288
And the caption
would read...

442
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:31,260
"Hope grows."

443
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:33,953
"In a dump."

444
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:42,132
Is the good news
that you found our leads?

445
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,366
No. Better.

446
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,805
We have an awesome beanbag chair

447
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,137
that's perfect
for the break room.

448
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,770
I'm never
gonna sit on that disgusting seat.

449
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:51,371
Yeah, damn right you're not,
'cause it's for me and Michael only!

450
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:55,407
Yeah!
Yeah!

451
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,615
It's freezing out here.

452
00:21:00,691 --> 00:21:01,783
Yeah!

453
00:21:05,329 --> 00:21:06,489
I have warm blood.

454
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:09,630
Oh, wow. Thank you.

455
00:21:14,505 --> 00:21:16,666
You're the nicest person
I've ever met.
