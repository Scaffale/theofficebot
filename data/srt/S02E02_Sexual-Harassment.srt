1
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:43,142
Hey, what's up?

2
00:00:43,144 --> 00:00:44,610
Hey.

3
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,478
Any emails today?

4
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,180
Um, I don't think so.

5
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:49,481
No?

6
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:53,118
Um, check your spam folder.

7
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,654
Oh, there it is.

8
00:00:55,656 --> 00:00:57,156
What?

9
00:00:57,158 --> 00:01:03,495
Um... 50 signs your priest
might be Michael Jackson.

10
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:06,632
Well done.
Topical.

11
00:01:06,634 --> 00:01:08,634
I am king of forwards.

12
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,170
It's how I like to do business.

13
00:01:11,172 --> 00:01:13,072
Everybody joking around.

14
00:01:13,074 --> 00:01:14,773
We're like Friends.

15
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:17,643
I am Chandler.

16
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:20,946
And Joey.

17
00:01:20,948 --> 00:01:23,515
And, uh, Pam is Rachel.

18
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:26,218
And Dwight is Kramer.

19
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,354
So the monkey
does the sex thing right...

20
00:01:29,356 --> 00:01:31,090
here!

21
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:33,392
That's funny!

22
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,726
That's funny.

23
00:01:34,728 --> 00:01:36,161
Not offensive.

24
00:01:36,163 --> 00:01:37,896
Because it's nature,
educational.

25
00:01:37,898 --> 00:01:39,531
Do want the link?

26
00:01:39,533 --> 00:01:41,166
'Cause then you could
forward it around.

27
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,835
Um, I...

28
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:44,503
Consider it.

29
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:46,205
Maybe, maybe.

30
00:01:46,207 --> 00:01:47,873
Well, we'll see.

31
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,441
Because I don't know
if it's a...

32
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,709
Wha... come on!

33
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:53,145
What has two thumbs
and likes to bone your mom?

34
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:54,980
This guy!

35
00:01:57,217 --> 00:01:58,750
Oh, you are so bad.

36
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,852
Yeah.

37
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,553
Oh, phew, ro, rah!
Aaah!

38
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:03,188
Oh, this guy is out of control.

39
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,057
He is a madman.

40
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,191
Better get the bleep button
ready for him.

41
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:07,559
Bleep bleep!

42
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:11,330
What's up, Halpert?
Still queer?

43
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:13,732
Uh-oh!

44
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,733
Oh ho ho!

45
00:02:14,735 --> 00:02:19,004
Todd Packer and I are total BFF.

46
00:02:19,006 --> 00:02:20,272
Best friends forever.

47
00:02:20,274 --> 00:02:22,975
He and I came up together
as salesmen.

48
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:28,881
One time we were out
and we met this set of twins.

49
00:02:28,883 --> 00:02:32,851
And Packer told them
that we were brothers.

50
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:35,687
And so, you know,
one thing led to another.

51
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:38,557
And we brought 'em back
to the motel.

52
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:42,194
And then Packer
did both of them.

53
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:43,929
It was awesome.

54
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:44,930
It was...

55
00:02:44,932 --> 00:02:46,131
Ow ow ow!
Oh.

56
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:49,101
Okay, grade A gossip
for you right now.

57
00:02:49,103 --> 00:02:51,637
Randall, CFO, resigned.

58
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:52,638
Nobody knows why.

59
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,339
Are you kidding?

60
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,074
Everyone knows why!

61
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,843
You don't know?
Oh, okay, check this out.

62
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,545
All right, so here's the story.

63
00:02:59,547 --> 00:03:01,480
So Randall is nailing
his secretary, right?

64
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:03,582
And she's totally incompetent.

65
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,950
Really?
Here we go.

66
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:07,519
Buckle up, it's gonna be
a bumpy one.

67
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,888
We're talking "blonde
incompetent," right?

68
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,889
Oh, yeah.

69
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,057
Like, uh, ten words a minute.

70
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:13,492
Talking.

71
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:15,394
Well, to be fair,
blondes, brunettes.

72
00:03:15,396 --> 00:03:17,095
You know, there are a lot
of dumb people out there.

73
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,497
They are women, right?

74
00:03:18,499 --> 00:03:20,332
Oh, wow!

75
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:21,700
I didn't say it!
I didn't say it!

76
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,335
I said it.

77
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:26,572
And then, suddenly,
for no reason,

78
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,974
this bimbo blows the whistle
on the whole thing

79
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,809
just to be a bitch.

80
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,245
Oh, wow, what'd I tell you
about the bleep button?

81
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:36,582
Hey, what has two thumbs
and hates Todd Packer?

82
00:03:36,584 --> 00:03:38,584
This guy!

83
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,385
I meant to ask you,
you think you can get someone

84
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,988
to drive me around because of
the DUI situation?

85
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,324
Oh, bad boy.

86
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,426
Um, Ryan.

87
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:50,462
Come on, kid, let's go.

88
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:51,463
Oh, man.

89
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:53,365
That Todd Packer
can do anything.

90
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:55,434
Except pass that breathalyzer.

91
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,608
You a big William Hung fan?

92
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,443
Why does everybody ask me that?

93
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,577
Who the hell is that?

94
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:13,018
I'm really excited
to meet your mom.

95
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,586
You are?

96
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,588
My mom is coming in to visit.

97
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,824
And she lives, like,
two hours away.

98
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,259
And she doesn't
have a cellphone.

99
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,527
Which is cool,
'cause it's kind of adding

100
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,996
some suspense to my day.

101
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,764
And I keep looking
over at the door,

102
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,733
hoping she'll walk in.

103
00:04:27,735 --> 00:04:29,001
I'm excited to show her around.

104
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:31,436
She really wants
to meet everybody.

105
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,404
Oh, yeah?
Good.

106
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,905
'Cause I have
a lot of questions.

107
00:04:33,907 --> 00:04:35,340
Oh, really?
Yeah.

108
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:38,443
As a child did Pam
show any traits

109
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:39,811
that would hint towards
her future career

110
00:04:39,813 --> 00:04:42,881
as a receptionist?

111
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:46,618
Hey, send me that link
to the monkey sex video.

112
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,487
I'm going to forward it
like it's hot.

113
00:04:48,489 --> 00:04:49,655
Yes!

114
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,326
Old school.

115
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:56,061
Michael?

116
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,663
Yes, Toby.

117
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,498
Um, I need to talk to you
in your office.

118
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,066
It'll just take two seconds.

119
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,036
Um, literally two seconds?

120
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:05,437
Toby is in HR,

121
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,173
which technically means
he works for corporate.

122
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,910
So he's really not
a part of our family.

123
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:13,245
Also, he's divorced,

124
00:05:13,247 --> 00:05:15,514
so he's really not
a part of his family.

125
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,416
The full story
is that Randall resigned

126
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:19,017
because of sexual harassment.

127
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:21,186
So corporate asked me
to do a five minute review

128
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,988
of the company's
sexual harassment policy.

129
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,623
No, no, Toby.
No.

130
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,624
It's really not
a big deal, Michael.

131
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:26,658
It is a big deal.

132
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,760
It's a big deal!

133
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,095
What are we supposed to do,

134
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,299
scrutinize every little thing
we say and do all day?

135
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,500
I mean, come on.

136
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:37,469
And then corporate
is gonna send in a lawyer.

137
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:38,937
What?
No!

138
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,106
Just to refresh you
on our policy.

139
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,607
What?
N-he... no.

140
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:45,610
Okay, what is a lawyer
gonna come in and tell us?

141
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:47,746
To not send out

142
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:50,415
hilarious emails
or not tell jokes?

143
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:51,450
Maybe not some of them.

144
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,051
Maybe not inappropriate ones.

145
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,587
There is no such thing
as an appropriate joke.

146
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,322
That's why it's a joke.

147
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,724
Everyone?
Hello?

148
00:05:58,726 --> 00:05:59,991
Everyone.
Hi.

149
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:01,393
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

150
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,795
I know you're all busy
and the last thing you want

151
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:06,031
is for a major interruption.

152
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:08,967
But Toby has an announcement
that he insists on making

153
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,335
right now
in the middle of the day.

154
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,037
So take it away.

155
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,839
Yeah, okay.

156
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,907
Corporate would like us
to do a five minute review

157
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:17,743
of the company's
sexual harassment policy,

158
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,077
so I'll go over that later.

159
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,079
I wish you luck, Toby,
I really do.

160
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:23,181
But you are going to have
a mutiny on your hands.

161
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:26,752
And I just can't wait to see
how you handle it.

162
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:29,621
A guy goes to a five dollar...

163
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:31,957
lady of the night.

164
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,826
And he gets crabs.

165
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:38,063
So the next day,
he goes back to complain.

166
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,931
And the woman says,

167
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:42,901
"Hey, it was only five dollars.

168
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,271
What did you expect,
lobster?"

169
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,342
This is what's at stake.

170
00:06:53,447 --> 00:06:55,480
Time to bring out the big guns.

171
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,215
I am heading down
to the warehouse,

172
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,984
where jokes are born.

173
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,086
Find a killer joke
that'll just blow

174
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,455
everybody away
at the seminar later.

175
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:07,359
And remind them what is great
about this place.

176
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,494
So... ah!
Here they are.

177
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,097
Guys, wondering if I could, uh,

178
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,532
get your help for something?

179
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,734
I am looking
for a new joke to tell.

180
00:07:15,736 --> 00:07:17,936
And it needs to be just killer.

181
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:20,172
And it does not
need to be clean.

182
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,173
So what you got?

183
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,541
Like, a joke?
A knock knock joke?

184
00:07:22,543 --> 00:07:23,909
Um, yeah... no.

185
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,177
I mean, better.
Better than that.

186
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:27,078
The type of stuff you guys
tell all day.

187
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,783
Well, those are some
awful tight pants you have on.

188
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,120
Where did you get 'em,
like, Queers 'R' Us?

189
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,555
Boys 'R' Us.

190
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,623
Oh!
All right, all right.

191
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,525
Well, yeah, but you know.

192
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:43,094
A joke but not necessarily
at my expense.

193
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,096
Man, we can see
all your business

194
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:47,365
coming around the corner, okay?

195
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,800
You need to, you know,
hide that.

196
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,135
Good thing you don't have
a lot of business

197
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,369
to start with.

198
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,772
Ohhhh, okay.

199
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,906
That was still about me.

200
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,041
Hey, hey, hey.

201
00:07:56,043 --> 00:07:57,275
So you don't have
the biggest package.

202
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,877
Don't feel bad.
I don't feel bad.

203
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,978
I think he feels bad.

204
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,012
No, I don't.

205
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,013
You look like you feel bad.

206
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:03,482
Okay, well...

207
00:08:03,484 --> 00:08:04,916
You know, not exactly
what I was looking for.

208
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,451
But thanks, guys.
Thank you!

209
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:07,419
You look good in those pants.

210
00:08:07,421 --> 00:08:08,787
He get it from his mama!

211
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,492
So, remember,
intent is irrelevant.

212
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,560
And that's it.
Pam.

213
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,731
Um, I just wanted to say
that... just,

214
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,333
my mom's coming in today.

215
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:22,868
Mmmmilf.

216
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,870
Thanks, Kevin.

217
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,372
Usually the day we talk about
sexual harassment

218
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:30,375
is the day that everyone
harasses me as a joke.

219
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:31,977
She's coming in today,
and maybe just don't joke

220
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,712
around about that stuff
in front of her?

221
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,980
Great point.

222
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:37,549
Uh, in fact, uh,
basic rule of thumb.

223
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:41,553
Let's just act every day
like Pam's mom is coming in.

224
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:43,154
All right, that's it.

225
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,823
If anybody has any questions
about anything,

226
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:46,525
you know where I sit
in the back.

227
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,862
Oh, is it over?

228
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,197
Uh, yes.

229
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,732
No.
I know, I know.

230
00:08:53,734 --> 00:08:55,333
It's good.
It is not over.

231
00:08:55,335 --> 00:08:57,936
It is not over 'til it's over.

232
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,437
Did he tell you everything?

233
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,939
Obviously he didn't,

234
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,674
because you all still look
relatively happy,

235
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,277
albeit bored.

236
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,411
Do you realize
what we're losing?

237
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:07,445
Seriously.

238
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,547
Email forwards.

239
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:10,916
Exactly.

240
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,018
Can we afford to lose

241
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,086
email forwards?
Do we want that?

242
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,821
I hate them.

243
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,557
You send me these filthy emails.

244
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,758
And you say,
"Forward them to 10 people,

245
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,859
or you'll have bad luck."

246
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:23,295
Give me a break.

247
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:26,932
Um, Stanley how about
that hot picture

248
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,466
you have by your desk?

249
00:09:28,468 --> 00:09:31,102
The centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

250
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:33,104
I mean, it is hot, it is sexy,

251
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,372
and it turns him on.

252
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,975
I will admit,
best part of my morning

253
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,610
is staring at it.

254
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:39,911
But what, are we just
gonna take it away?

255
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,279
That is my daughter.

256
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,114
She goes to Catholic
girl's school.

257
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:45,584
I'm taking it down right now.

258
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,152
Um, what about office romance?

259
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:51,456
Office relationships
are never a good idea,

260
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,591
so let's just try to avoid 'em.

261
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,926
But if you already have one,

262
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,227
you should disclose it to HR.

263
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,163
Um, all relationships?

264
00:09:58,165 --> 00:10:00,899
Even a one night stand?

265
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,734
I think the old honor system
was fine.

266
00:10:02,736 --> 00:10:05,403
For example, I have never
slept with an employee.

267
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,205
And believe me, I could have.

268
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:09,608
Yeah, Meredith.

269
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,842
No, no, Catherine.
Remember her?

270
00:10:10,844 --> 00:10:12,043
Remember how hot she was?

271
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,578
She would have definitely
slept with me.

272
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:14,913
She wasn't that hot.

273
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,682
Yes, she was.
Dammit, Kevin!

274
00:10:17,684 --> 00:10:20,619
I'm in an office relationship.

275
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,953
It's special.

276
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,155
Mmm, she's nice, she's shy.

277
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,857
She's actually here
if you wanna meet her.

278
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,993
Hold on a second.

279
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,030
Oh, my God.
Put on a shirt!

280
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:34,666
Put... I told you
that you'd be on camera.

281
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:36,001
I'm sorry, she's European.

282
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:39,437
No, I told you
that you'd be on camera.

283
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:40,605
Stop.

284
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,141
What if Pam was a lesbian?

285
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:47,412
What if she brought
her "partner" into work?

286
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,580
Would that be crossing the line?

287
00:10:48,582 --> 00:10:49,948
No.

288
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:52,083
What if they made out
in front of everybody?

289
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,185
Well, that would be...
At home?

290
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:58,523
And I told everybody
everything about it?

291
00:10:58,525 --> 00:10:59,524
Okay, I'm lost.

292
00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,325
Okay.

293
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,526
Well, then, let's act it out.

294
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,194
Pam, you will be girl A.

295
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:06,364
And girl B will be...

296
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:09,334
Okay, we'll use the doll.

297
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:11,236
Pam?

298
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,471
Pam?

299
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,277
I wish Todd Packer was here,
'cause he would love this.

300
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,179
I wonder if anybody else
would like to join us.

301
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:22,781
Oop.
Coming out of my mouth.

302
00:11:22,783 --> 00:11:26,618
Hey, um,
we have to watch Toby's video

303
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,686
that he's showing us

304
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:29,087
in order to brainwash us.

305
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:31,389
And I was wondering
if anybody'd like to join in?

306
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:32,791
Gonna be fun.

307
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:33,825
Got microwave pizza.

308
00:11:33,827 --> 00:11:36,027
What do you say?
Jim?

309
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,195
No, thanks, I'm good.

310
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,365
That's what she said.
Pam?

311
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,801
Um, my mother's coming.

312
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,335
That's what she said...

313
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:46,204
No, but... okay.

314
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:47,272
Well, suit yourself.

315
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:49,974
Hey, Toby.

316
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:50,975
Hey, Dwight.

317
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,677
You said that we could
come to you

318
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,045
if we had any questions.

319
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,213
Sure.

320
00:11:58,651 --> 00:12:00,418
Where is the clitoris?

321
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:08,493
On a website it said
on the crest of the labia.

322
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,397
What does that mean?

323
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,436
What does the female vagina
look like?

324
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,672
Technically, I am
in human resources.

325
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:24,008
And Dwight was asking
about human anatomy.

326
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,379
Um, I'm just sad
the public school system

327
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,682
failed him so badly.

328
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:31,950
You know, maybe when you get

329
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,885
really comfortable
with each other,

330
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:36,354
you can ask for that.

331
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:38,723
Good.

332
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:39,924
Good.
And...

333
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,593
I should get back to work.

334
00:12:41,595 --> 00:12:43,128
Okay.

335
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,330
In today's fast paced
business climate,

336
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:47,165
it can sometimes to hard to know

337
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:50,702
when a comment or an action
crosses the line.

338
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:52,537
Let's take a look
at a couple of scenarios

339
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,605
and ask ourselves,

340
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,941
where is the line?

341
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:59,878
The natural redhead.

342
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,845
Hey, Marie.

343
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:02,580
Hey, Joe, Mike.

344
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:03,915
Hey, settle a bet.

345
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,018
Are you a natural redhead?

346
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,455
Oh my... ay, stop the video!

347
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,123
Wait, go... stop it right there.
Stop it right there.

348
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:17,428
That's that girl
from that thing.

349
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,596
I banged this girl right here.

350
00:13:18,598 --> 00:13:19,764
That's her?

351
00:13:19,766 --> 00:13:20,899
Yes, this is the one.
You remember...

352
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,500
No, the party?
You banged her?

353
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,702
Right here.
You are a naughty girl.

354
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,870
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

355
00:13:25,872 --> 00:13:27,238
Okay, hypocrite.

356
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,840
Okay, she is a hypocrite.

357
00:13:28,842 --> 00:13:30,975
That is such a scam.
Okay.

358
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,377
Yes?

359
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,179
Yes, I did.

360
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:35,413
Okay.

361
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:37,182
Well, we can talk
about that later then.

362
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:38,316
Okay, you are never
gonna believe this.

363
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,584
The girl in the video

364
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,019
we're watching
that corporate gave us.

365
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,320
Darryl banged her!

366
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:47,692
And...

367
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:51,129
He's about 90% sure.

368
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:55,233
Don't ever let this little bitch

369
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:56,334
drive you around town.

370
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,769
We got lost for half an hour.

371
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,771
I don't have any DUls,
so I can drive myself.

372
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:00,972
But thanks.

373
00:14:00,974 --> 00:14:02,607
Where is Michael Snot?

374
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:05,777
Sniffing some dude's thong?

375
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:07,946
Probably.

376
00:14:07,948 --> 00:14:10,949
So you are the lawyer,
Mr. O'Malley.

377
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,350
I know a lot of lawyer jokes.

378
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,852
I love lawyer jokes.

379
00:14:13,854 --> 00:14:16,554
Well, it's probably because
you don't get 'em.

380
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:18,790
When I said before
that I was king of forwards,

381
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,725
you gotta understand
that I don't

382
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,293
come up with this stuff.

383
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:25,496
I just forward it along.

384
00:14:25,498 --> 00:14:27,432
You wouldn't arrest a guy
who's just delivering drugs

385
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,434
from one guy to another.

386
00:14:29,436 --> 00:14:31,002
You seem a little bit
agitated, Michael.

387
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:32,103
What's the problem?

388
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:35,340
The problem is that...

389
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:36,608
I am the boss.

390
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,142
And apparently
I can't say anything.

391
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:43,181
Well, that's... that's true
in a way.

392
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:45,850
You can't say "anything."

393
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:46,951
Where's the line?

394
00:14:46,953 --> 00:14:48,052
Where's the line, Jan?

395
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:49,554
Do you need to see
the video again, Michael?

396
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,155
No, I've seen the video.
He talked the whole time.

397
00:14:51,157 --> 00:14:52,423
No, I didn't.

398
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,727
What?

399
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,467
Attention, everyone.
Hello?

400
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:04,936
Uh, yes, I just want you
to know that, uh,

401
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,137
this is not my decision.

402
00:15:06,139 --> 00:15:11,442
But from here on out,
we can no longer be friends.

403
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,346
And when we talk about
things here,

404
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:20,051
we must only discuss
work associated things.

405
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:23,821
And you can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

406
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,425
And in the future, if I want
to say something funny,

407
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,827
or witty, or do an impression,

408
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:34,165
I will no longer ever
do any of those things.

409
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:37,335
Does that include,
"That's what she said"?

410
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:40,104
Mm-hmm, yes.

411
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:42,073
Wow, that is really hard.

412
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,543
Do you really think
you can go all day long?

413
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,182
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

414
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,452
That's what she said!

415
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,486
Michael...

416
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,554
Michael!

417
00:15:56,556 --> 00:15:59,057
Michael, please.

418
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,160
Come on!

419
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,294
You would have done the same.

420
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,796
You just didn't
think of it first.

421
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,631
Mi-Michael, please.
I-I... really.

422
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,232
That's not my sense of humor.

423
00:16:08,234 --> 00:16:09,467
Okay.
Hello.

424
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,202
Jan, Mr. O'Malley,

425
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:14,172
this is my lawyer
James P. Albini.

426
00:16:14,174 --> 00:16:15,740
I believe you may
recognize his face

427
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,642
from the billboards.

428
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,178
He specializes
in free speech issues.

429
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,447
And motorcycle head injuries,
worker's comp,

430
00:16:22,449 --> 00:16:24,248
and diet pill lawsuits.

431
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,350
This guy does it all.

432
00:16:25,352 --> 00:16:27,151
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

433
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,220
Michael, Mr. O'Malley
is your lawyer.

434
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:32,056
What?

435
00:16:32,058 --> 00:16:34,625
Mr. O'Malley
is our corporate lawyer.

436
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,295
We have him on retainer
to protect the company,

437
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,130
as well as upper level
management

438
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,231
such as yourself.

439
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,935
So I'm not in trouble?

440
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,804
I am so used to being
the bad boy.

441
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:49,507
I am so used
to fighting corporate

442
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,175
that I forget
that I am corporate.

443
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,810
Upper management.

444
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,080
They hooked me up
with an attorney.

445
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,915
To protect me.

446
00:16:59,084 --> 00:17:02,186
You can't be too careful
about what you say.

447
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:04,589
Mo' money, mo' problems.

448
00:17:04,591 --> 00:17:07,759
Okay, well, let's get you
out of here, James.

449
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,394
Um, I think
we're under an hour still.

450
00:17:09,396 --> 00:17:11,529
Yeah, but I did a lot
of paperwork at home.

451
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,930
We'll talk about it later.

452
00:17:12,932 --> 00:17:14,032
Thanks for coming in.

453
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,171
Um, hello.

454
00:17:20,173 --> 00:17:21,706
Oh, my God!

455
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,141
I finally made it.

456
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,208
Hello!

457
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,477
I love my mom.

458
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:30,381
Okay, that's probably the
most obvious statement ever.

459
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,749
This is all yours?

460
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,017
Yeah, I am in charge
of this whole area.

461
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,685
Oh, my goodness.
That's great.

462
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,362
So a guy goes home,
tells his wife,

463
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,464
"Honey, pack your bags,
I just won the lottery."

464
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,266
She goes, "Oh, my God.
That's incredible.

465
00:17:48,268 --> 00:17:49,567
Where are we going?"

466
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,002
He goes, "I don't know
where you're going,

467
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:52,770
just be out of here by five."

468
00:17:56,341 --> 00:17:57,909
Boom!

469
00:17:57,911 --> 00:18:00,111
This is where
I used to keep my computer.

470
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:01,479
Oh, right, I remember.

471
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,881
With the picture, yeah.

472
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,583
But I switched stuff around
because I actually needed,

473
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,119
like, more room
for organization.

474
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:10,488
This is, like, um...

475
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:13,124
Oh, there he is.

476
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,692
How are you?
Hey, handsome.

477
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,527
You look great.
Oh, thank you.

478
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,629
So, we ready for dinner?

479
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,698
Well, you know,
actually I kind of need to

480
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,899
stall a bit.

481
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:23,201
But it's okay,

482
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,603
because I am very used
to killing time.

483
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,971
Oh, I don't believe that.

484
00:18:26,973 --> 00:18:28,606
Okay, I'm gonna go wait
in the parking lot.

485
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:31,042
And what kind of tunes
do you want for the ride?

486
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,111
A little classical,
a little oldies?

487
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,113
Oh, anything is fine.

488
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,248
All right, we'll see ya.

489
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,619
So which one is Jim?

490
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,888
Mom!

491
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,022
I just wanted to know.

492
00:18:45,024 --> 00:18:46,824
No, it's...
All right, okay.

493
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:48,793
10 minutes,
then we can go to dinner.

494
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,861
I'll make myself busy.

495
00:18:49,863 --> 00:18:51,028
There's this guy,

496
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,663
he's at a nymphomaniac
convention.

497
00:18:52,665 --> 00:18:54,765
And he is psyched,

498
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,434
'cause all these woman
are smoking hot perfect 10s,

499
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,536
except for this one chick
who looks a lot like...

500
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:00,872
Phyllis?
Yeah.

501
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,473
No, no, no.
That crosses the line.

502
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:03,875
Ex-squeeze me?

503
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,411
Not you.

504
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:10,781
Kevin.
Just unwarranted.

505
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:11,816
Hostile work environment, Kevin.

506
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,117
Packer said it.

507
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,652
No, you said it.

508
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,054
He pointed.
A point is not a say.

509
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:21,192
Look, Kevin,
we are a family here.

510
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,127
And Phyllis is a valued
member of that family.

511
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,262
Like a grandmother.

512
00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:25,396
I'm the same age
as you, Michael.

513
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:26,531
I don't know about that.

514
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:27,865
We're the same
high school class.

515
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, I have a late birthday

516
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:31,369
and usually September
is a cut off point...

517
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,403
You know what?

518
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,672
You just crossed the line, okay?

519
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,707
There is a line
and you went over it.

520
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:40,645
And you must be punished.
So go to your corner.

521
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:41,712
You mean where my desk is?

522
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:43,047
Yes, your corner.
Go.

523
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:45,082
Okay.

524
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:46,817
I have a lot of work
to do, anyway.

525
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:48,486
Oh, my.

526
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:51,022
They really got to you,
didn't they?

527
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,124
They didn't get to me.

528
00:19:53,126 --> 00:19:54,792
I got to them.

529
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:59,664
I am still
the same old Michael Scott.

530
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:02,567
New and improved.

531
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:03,935
You know what?

532
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,536
I love Phyllis.

533
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:09,307
You know what else?

534
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:11,442
I think she is gorgeous.

535
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:16,581
I think she is an incredibly,
incredibly attractive person.

536
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,582
Come here.
Give me a kiss.

537
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,749
Come on.

538
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:20,451
Michael, come on,
you don't have to worry.

539
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,986
I'm not gonna...
I'm not worried.

540
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,255
Report you to HR.
You know what?

541
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:26,557
The only thing
I am worried about

542
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,726
is getting a boner.

543
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,495
Good work today, everybody.

544
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,970
Times have changed a little.

545
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:41,706
And even though
we're still a family here

546
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,409
at Dunder Mifflin,
families grow.

547
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:46,744
And at some point,

548
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:51,582
the daddy can't take a bath
with the kids anymore.

549
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:52,850
I am upper management.

550
00:20:52,852 --> 00:20:55,653
And it would be inappropriate
for me

551
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:58,122
to take a bath with Pam.

552
00:20:58,124 --> 00:21:00,191
As much as I might want to.

553
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:01,559
He said what?
