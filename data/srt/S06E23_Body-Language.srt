00:00:11,843 --> 00:00:12,832
Hello, Dunder Mifflin.

2
00:00:12,911 --> 00:00:14,344
No, no, no. No.

3
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:19,776
I believe that every man,
woman, and child in this country

4
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,284
should learn how
to speak Spanish.

5
00:00:21,353 --> 00:00:25,619
They are our neighbors to the south,
and this would be a healing thing

6
00:00:26,358 --> 00:00:28,451
for all of North America.

7
00:00:29,795 --> 00:00:34,061
And I am going on vacation
next week to CancÃºn.

8
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:51,472
I don't understand why Michael
is wasting his time with Spanish.

9
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:53,984
I have it on very good
authority that within 20 years,

10
00:00:54,052 --> 00:00:56,486
everyone will be
speaking German.

11
00:00:56,888 --> 00:00:58,981
Or a Chinese-German hybrid.

12
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:08,229
Michael's having a hard time
with the gender part of Spanish.

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,858
So, I told him
to mark everything

14
00:01:09,935 --> 00:01:12,460
with the international
symbol for gender.

15
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:13,697
And...

16
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,441
I should have been
more specific.

17
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,976
Your office is full
of genitalia.

18
00:01:23,949 --> 00:01:24,973
"That's what he says"?

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,278
Damn it.

20
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,018
Ah, Angelo!

21
00:01:28,086 --> 00:01:29,178
Angela.

22
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:33,147
Michael.

23
00:01:58,283 --> 00:02:02,344
All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing
and then you go into delivery guarantees.

24
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:05,913
You know, maybe there's an
opportunity for a joke there, like...

25
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:08,459
Like, "I just
delivered a baby.

26
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,451
"They didn't offer
me a guarantee."

27
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,725
Yeah. Maybe we don't
even need that.

28
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:16,893
Can you smell the power?
Halperts, power couple.

29
00:02:17,035 --> 00:02:18,832
You know what? I should be
getting this client, Michael.

30
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:20,462
My numbers are better
than either of theirs.

31
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,474
I went with the people I thought
would put the best face on the company.

32
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,942
If you want people to put
the best face on something,

33
00:02:26,011 --> 00:02:27,035
why would you
get two people

34
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:31,014
who probably have never cut the
face off of anything in their lives?

35
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:32,072
It's a good point.

36
00:02:32,517 --> 00:02:34,451
This is our first
joint sales pitch.

37
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:36,009
I think we're gonna work
really well together.

38
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:38,955
Yeah. I think we have
complementary strengths.

39
00:02:39,024 --> 00:02:40,013
We understand
each other.

40
00:02:40,092 --> 00:02:41,923
We have good
give and take.

41
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:43,620
I give, he takes!

42
00:02:45,263 --> 00:02:47,322
I don't even know
who you are anymore.

43
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:54,666
Hi. Donna Newton.
Here to see Michael Scott.

44
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:58,905
Hey, Miss Newton. Hi.
I'm Jim. How are you?

45
00:02:58,977 --> 00:03:01,377
Did somebody order
a hooker over here?

46
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:02,470
Stop that. Hi.

47
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:03,844
Hi. How are you?

48
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,950
There's this woman
I met a few weeks ago.

49
00:03:06,017 --> 00:03:09,475
Her name is Donna. Manager
of a Sid and Dexter's.

50
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,655
And right now, we're in the
midst of a passionate love affair.

51
00:03:15,861 --> 00:03:19,854
No, but she is coming by today,
maybe to buy some printers, so...

52
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:24,033
Right here, we have the wonder
twins, Jim and Pam Halpert.

53
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:25,729
They will be
assisting you today.

54
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:27,795
You look exactly alike.

55
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,306
No, we're
actually married.

56
00:03:29,374 --> 00:03:30,636
We're not
brother and sister.

57
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:32,574
I have a sense about
these things. All right.

58
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:36,876
You have some ancestors
in common somewhere back.

59
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:39,743
I knew it. You should see their baby.

60
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:45,650
So, yes, laser printers are more
expensive, but they cost less to operate,

61
00:03:45,724 --> 00:03:46,918
so it's a trade-off.

62
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,721
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

63
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,654
Little time sensitive. Do
you, Donna, by any chance

64
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,254
shop at Victoria's Secret?
What?

65
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:56,494
Because I keep getting
these magazines sent to me

66
00:03:56,902 --> 00:04:01,066
via the address of the woman who
used to live in my condo before me.

67
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:02,401
None of this
is time sensitive.

68
00:04:02,474 --> 00:04:04,908
Yes, the sale's on
now through May.

69
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:06,068
Oh, yeah, thank you.

70
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:07,543
Okay. I have more of them.

71
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:11,514
You would have weekly conference
calls with executives in corporate,

72
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:14,450
a two week training program at
the Yale School of Management.

73
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,285
Obviously you would be high on the
list for advancement opportunities.

74
00:04:18,356 --> 00:04:19,414
Sounds all right.

75
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:20,651
What is this?

76
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:22,249
This is Print
In All Colors,

77
00:04:22,327 --> 00:04:25,194
Sabre's minority
executive training program.

78
00:04:25,263 --> 00:04:27,561
It doesn't just sound
"aite," it sounds amazing.

79
00:04:27,632 --> 00:04:28,963
I didn't say "aite."

80
00:04:29,034 --> 00:04:30,262
How do I apply?

81
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,927
You have to be a minority.

82
00:04:32,304 --> 00:04:34,772
Glasses wearers,
cholera survivors,

83
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,071
geniuses, non-organic family
farmers. The list goes on and on.

84
00:04:38,143 --> 00:04:39,576
You want me to keep going?
Those don't really count.

85
00:04:39,644 --> 00:04:42,670
We're thinking more ethnic
and racial minorities.

86
00:04:42,747 --> 00:04:44,942
Come here. Come here.

87
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,514
Ten seconds ago this guy
was driving a forklift, okay?

88
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:53,422
Now, all of a sudden, he's Cinderella of
the office? What are you guys thinking?

89
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:55,716
I like the sound of this.

90
00:04:55,827 --> 00:04:58,762
Maybe one day I'll be
sitting in Michael's chair.

91
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,559
Wouldn't that be something?

92
00:05:00,632 --> 00:05:03,533
<i>One minority from this branch
is going to get into this program.</i>

93
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:05,759
Who would I prefer? Hmm.

94
00:05:06,371 --> 00:05:09,898
The competent hardworking one
who does things his own way,

95
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:14,679
or the malleable simpleton who can
be bought for a few fashion magazines?

96
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:18,214
This is the second time that
you've sent me the wrong size.

97
00:05:18,283 --> 00:05:19,682
I mean, I know what
a four should feel like.

98
00:05:19,751 --> 00:05:21,241
I've been a four
my whole life.

99
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:24,618
You know what? You can go to hell,
all right? Thanks for nothing.

100
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:27,783
Oh, man.
White people, right?

101
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:28,917
I don't know
if she was white.

102
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,287
Well, you can kind of
tell from their voice.

103
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,455
Yeah.

104
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:35,796
I bet you get pulled over by the
cops a lot just because of your race.

105
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,700
Well, they say it's because of
texting, but maybe you're right.

106
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,797
I think you should consider applying for
the executive minority training program.

107
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,035
I never thought of myself
as an executive before.

108
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,010
I know, 'cause you
have no role models.

109
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:49,808
How many Indian CEOs
can you think of?

110
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:52,008
I can't think of
any CEOs, any race.

111
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,381
You could be
the Indian Bill Gates.

112
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,778
You could be
the Indian Ted Turner.

113
00:05:59,491 --> 00:06:02,016
I could be
the Indian Julia Roberts.

114
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:05,759
That's not... She's...
Okay. Yes.

115
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:10,225
I took the liberty to scan a few things
earlier, and I want to show you...

116
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:13,863
There we go! Look at those
vivid colors. Look at my eyes.

117
00:06:14,005 --> 00:06:15,870
Those are
Shrek-green eyes.

118
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:20,503
That is me again. I think this
displays the crisp, dazzling white.

119
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:23,041
And that would
be a display

120
00:06:23,114 --> 00:06:24,240
of the crisp,
gorgeous black.

121
00:06:24,316 --> 00:06:25,408
Yeah.

122
00:06:25,684 --> 00:06:28,744
It's subtle.
It's how it works.

123
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,983
<i>I show her an image
that turns her on,</i>

124
00:06:31,056 --> 00:06:33,047
<i>and then she looks at me,
then she looks at the image,</i>

125
00:06:33,124 --> 00:06:34,489
<i>then back at me,
then back at the image.</i>

126
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,528
<i>Soon she doesn't know what
is me, what is the image,</i>

127
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:39,621
she just knows
that she's turned on.

128
00:06:40,365 --> 00:06:44,028
This is a place that I like to
go to be alone with my thoughts.

129
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,730
I've never taken
anybody there before.

130
00:06:46,871 --> 00:06:48,896
Who took the photo?
Ryan.

131
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:49,998
Oh.

132
00:06:50,575 --> 00:06:52,065
And that's it.

133
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,372
That's me.
That's who I am.

134
00:06:57,048 --> 00:06:59,141
Not bad.

135
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,684
Oh, thanks.

136
00:07:01,286 --> 00:07:02,719
You're not bad, either.

137
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:03,947
Thank you.

138
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,222
Oh, my God.

139
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:14,595
Jim, could you come
in here for a sec?

140
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:18,199
What was that printer
we were looking at?

141
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,138
You didn't see it, Pam.

142
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:24,832
She was giving me all sorts of signals
that she wanted me to make a move.

143
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:25,967
Shortbread?
No.

144
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,477
I'll have one.

145
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:29,979
Well, maybe you shouldn't
try to kiss people at work.

146
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:32,482
Oh, really, Jim?
What about Pam?

147
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,541
And you did a heck
of a lot more than kiss.

148
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:35,950
Maybe this could
be my Pam.

149
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,511
Okay, well,
all that is irrelevant...

150
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:39,614
Maybe Michael
has a point.

151
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,985
I mean, if she was really that
upset, she wouldn't still be here.

152
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,397
Was it professional? No.

153
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,894
But I work in the nightlife
industry. I get hit on all the time.

154
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:54,097
In my 20s,
it would've been annoying.

155
00:07:54,172 --> 00:07:56,231
In my late 20s,
I find it really flattering.

156
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:58,976
Look, I know that
I screwed up in there.

157
00:07:59,044 --> 00:08:00,739
I know that I probably
messed up your sale.

158
00:08:00,812 --> 00:08:02,279
I just want to go
in and fix it.

159
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:04,872
What if I back out and you
finish the pitch with Jim?

160
00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:06,041
What?

161
00:08:06,751 --> 00:08:08,378
What was that?
Just let him flirt with her.

162
00:08:08,453 --> 00:08:10,387
People meet each
other all sorts of ways.

163
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,390
Pam, you know he's not gonna get
anywhere and he's gonna blow our sale.

164
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:14,857
Who cares?
It's not that huge a sale.

165
00:08:14,926 --> 00:08:18,020
Hey, the Schwab guy told us to treat
every sale like it was a huge sale.

166
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:21,463
Don't act like you understood
anything that guy said.

167
00:08:23,034 --> 00:08:24,763
Good luck, wingman.

168
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:30,032
How has being
a minority affected you?

169
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,666
Well, there's a lot of
pressure from my parents

170
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,075
to settle down
and marry an Indian guy.

171
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:36,477
Oh, good. And you
resent this because...

172
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:40,177
Indian guys always wear their cell
phones outside their pants. It's so dorky.

173
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:44,915
No, no, no. That's not dorky. Look,
it's easily accessible. Boom. Like this.

174
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,781
911, hello. Scranton
Strangler's in the house.

175
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,486
Inside the house!

176
00:08:50,395 --> 00:08:52,260
Just put it
in your pocket.

177
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:57,062
Look at that. She's
totally flirting with him.

178
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:01,035
You don't know that. Some people
can't help oozing sexuality.

179
00:09:01,706 --> 00:09:04,106
You ever notice you can
only ooze two things?

180
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:07,144
Sexuality and pus.
Man, I tell you.

181
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,011
She just crossed her
arms together. That's bad.

182
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:14,415
Maybe she's just pushing her breasts
together to make them look bigger.

183
00:09:19,023 --> 00:09:20,149
Like that?

184
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,659
Is this the best
you can do right now?

185
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:24,126
For that printer, yes.

186
00:09:24,329 --> 00:09:26,763
Unfortunately we don't
have a lot of flexibility.

187
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:30,597
Oh. Well, I guess I'm just used
to the restaurant business where,

188
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:33,398
if you're in charge then
you can always get discounts

189
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:34,665
for the people
that you like.

190
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:36,001
Yeah.

191
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,135
Maybe we can find
a little wiggle room, right?

192
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,234
What's that?

193
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:41,903
Maybe we can find some
wiggle room.

194
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,140
I don't...
I don't think so.

195
00:09:43,214 --> 00:09:45,079
I think we could.

196
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,647
I don't see how we could possibly sell
these for that little without losing money.

197
00:09:50,722 --> 00:09:52,212
Delivery alone will cost...

198
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,518
Okay, well, sometimes,

199
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:58,790
sometimes it makes financial sense to
lose money, right? Like, for tax purposes.

200
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:02,124
Actually, I ran the numbers
on this, and in this case,

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,963
it makes more financial
sense to gain money.

202
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,059
Why don't you
run them again?

203
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,434
What if she's just flirting
with you to get a better price?

204
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,665
If she is,
it's working.

205
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,676
Yeah, Michael, here's a trick.
Ask her if she wants a mint.

206
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:17,012
If she says no, then
she is not interested.

207
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,912
She does not like him.

208
00:10:18,983 --> 00:10:23,682
You can flirt with someone to get what
you want and also be attracted to them.

209
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,120
How do you think
we got together?

210
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,953
'Cause I stopped by your
desk, like, 15 times a day.

211
00:10:27,025 --> 00:10:28,856
I was after your money.

212
00:10:28,927 --> 00:10:30,121
Well, the joke was on you.

213
00:10:30,195 --> 00:10:31,560
Yes, it was.

214
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,963
Can you stop
micromanaging?

215
00:10:34,032 --> 00:10:35,863
I know how to do this.
You're yelling... Okay. Okay.

216
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:36,923
What are you guys doing?

217
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,730
This girl was really rude
to me at the mall,

218
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,704
so I created a fake IM account
from a hot guy at her high school,

219
00:10:41,773 --> 00:10:43,206
and now I'm trying
to make her anorexic.

220
00:10:43,274 --> 00:10:45,504
Tell her everyone in
homeroom thinks she's fat.

221
00:10:45,577 --> 00:10:46,601
That is so good.

222
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,771
You know, we really should keep
practicing for this interview.

223
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:50,314
Oh, that's okay.
Ryan coached me.

224
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,246
Ryan? What does he know?

225
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:54,376
It's easy. You just turn
every question around on them.

226
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,249
Do you think you're treated
differently because of your race?

227
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,983
Would you ask that same
question if I was white?

228
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:00,752
We're so in.
We?

229
00:11:01,226 --> 00:11:03,592
When I become executive,
I'm gonna make Ryan manager.

230
00:11:03,661 --> 00:11:06,494
And then the two of us
are cleaning house.

231
00:11:07,131 --> 00:11:09,122
<i>Kelly will be
even worse than Darryl.</i>

232
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:10,594
If you'd have told
me this morning

233
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:14,399
that today I'd be creating a monster
capable of my own destruction,

234
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:18,374
I'd have thought you were referring to the
bull Mose and I are trying to reanimate.

235
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:23,444
"So, corporate approval of this contract
is contingent upon buyer and seller

236
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:26,347
"obtaining..."
Blah-de-blah-de-blah.

237
00:11:26,417 --> 00:11:29,682
"Boilerplate, pound
of fish." Just kidding.

238
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:32,656
Do you like mints?
Yes.

239
00:11:32,724 --> 00:11:34,555
I carry mints
with me sometimes.

240
00:11:34,626 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh, I haven't
tried those.

241
00:11:35,894 --> 00:11:36,918
Ever tried those?
No.

242
00:11:36,995 --> 00:11:38,019
They're good.

243
00:11:38,096 --> 00:11:39,120
You want one?

244
00:11:40,398 --> 00:11:42,229
Sure.
It's like...

245
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:47,399
"Cool... Certified cool." I
like how they say "certified."

246
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:51,239
Like there's some
consortium of...

247
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:54,736
Michael!

248
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:55,972
I'm sorry.

249
00:11:57,148 --> 00:11:58,581
I can't stop myself
from kissing her.

250
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:02,711
Yeah. Now you know how I feel
sitting next to those M&M's all day.

251
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:04,520
Well, why don't you
just move the M&M's?

252
00:12:04,589 --> 00:12:06,022
Why don't you shut up?

253
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:10,220
Okay. Guys, guys, guys, just tell me it's
not totally insane to try one more time.

254
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:11,319
It is totally insane.

255
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,921
Michael, he's right. You
are turning into a stalker.

256
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,829
Okay.
What do you think?

257
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,565
I think it's over, man.

258
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:18,994
Andy?

259
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:22,464
Okay, some for,
some against.

260
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,564
Nobody's for.

261
00:12:23,641 --> 00:12:24,699
Pam.
Hmm?

262
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,868
What do you think?

263
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,873
I think it's really,
really unlikely.

264
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:29,971
Okay.

265
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:31,640
Really unlikely.

266
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,941
But I can't say
that it's impossible.

267
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:35,212
What?

268
00:12:35,386 --> 00:12:37,377
I'm not saying
she's in love with him,

269
00:12:37,455 --> 00:12:39,787
but she could have
left a while ago.

270
00:12:39,857 --> 00:12:43,258
Most printer sales are done
over the phone, Miss Boob Shirt.

271
00:12:43,394 --> 00:12:45,021
I'm going
with Pam's group.

272
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,030
Wait. Michael.

273
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:49,564
Okay.
Michael. Michael.

274
00:12:49,634 --> 00:12:53,593
No. Guys, guys, guys, guys,
just thank you for talking.

275
00:12:54,839 --> 00:12:56,500
Wish me luck.
- No.

276
00:12:56,841 --> 00:12:59,674
<i>What sort of movie would Rudy
have been if he had just stopped</i>

277
00:12:59,744 --> 00:13:02,178
and given up
after two rejections?

278
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,479
Would have been a lot shorter,
probably been a lot funnier,

279
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:10,817
but it would have ultimately
been a disappointment.

280
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:16,722
I still would have seen it,
but that's not the point.

281
00:13:19,731 --> 00:13:21,995
Kelly is disqualified.
What?

282
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,191
You said the program
is not open to Caucasians.

283
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:28,102
Well, anthropologically,
she is Indian.

284
00:13:28,172 --> 00:13:31,300
Indians migrated from the
Caucasus region of Europe.

285
00:13:31,376 --> 00:13:34,709
Therefore, technically, she is
Caucasian. You're welcome, America.

286
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:36,269
Yeah, but she's
not white, though.

287
00:13:36,347 --> 00:13:38,747
Well, obviously
she's brownish,

288
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:41,785
but come on. I mean,
Darryl is far more ethnic.

289
00:13:41,853 --> 00:13:43,650
Darryl withdrew
his application.

290
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:48,556
The dates of the Yale program interfered
with his softball league, so he's gone.

291
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:51,887
I got my whole life
to be a minority executive.

292
00:13:51,963 --> 00:13:54,625
I only have about a year
left in these knees, though.

293
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,699
So Kelly is
the only applicant.

294
00:13:56,768 --> 00:13:58,759
Yeah, unless somebody
else applies today.

295
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,768
Oh, dear God. Okay.

296
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:10,008
Don't make any decisions just
yet. Okay? I'll be right back.

297
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,742
Hello.

298
00:14:12,817 --> 00:14:15,308
That's very nice. I
never noticed that before.

299
00:14:15,386 --> 00:14:17,013
Sometimes my bangs cover it.

300
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:21,354
Yeah. I don't want to be offensive,
but may I ask you what that means?

301
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,950
I do find that offensive,
actually.

302
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:27,922
We should have your
contract done by Thursday.

303
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:31,358
Oh, great! Great. I will
look out for that stuff, then.

304
00:14:31,436 --> 00:14:32,926
Okay.
And...

305
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:37,898
You know, I just wanted to say it was
really, really nice to do business with you.

306
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:40,842
Yeah. It was nice to do
business with you, too.

307
00:14:40,912 --> 00:14:42,243
Thank you.

308
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:45,106
Did I get everything?

309
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:46,241
I don't know.

310
00:14:46,317 --> 00:14:47,409
I think so.

311
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,543
Yeah, I think so.

312
00:14:49,287 --> 00:14:50,379
Okay.

313
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:55,083
So... Oh! Donna?
- Yeah.

314
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,821
Do you need validation?
We don't validate.

315
00:14:57,895 --> 00:14:59,055
No. It's just
in the lot, so...

316
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:00,256
Thank you so much.

317
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:04,062
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

318
00:15:04,535 --> 00:15:05,695
Mmm.

319
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:08,096
Bye.

320
00:15:10,141 --> 00:15:13,133
So, if you have...

321
00:15:13,211 --> 00:15:15,111
If there's any other
questions that you have...

322
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:18,842
I don't have any
other questions.

323
00:15:19,317 --> 00:15:23,117
I'm just gonna make
my way down to...

324
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,711
Okay.
All right. Bye.

325
00:15:24,789 --> 00:15:25,915
Bye-bye.

326
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,287
Have a good elevator ride.

327
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,382
Okay.

328
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:32,628
What's that out there?

329
00:15:37,268 --> 00:15:39,168
Michael,
how did it go?

330
00:15:42,473 --> 00:15:46,000
How would one of you feel if I told
you I could put you on a fast track

331
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:48,341
to an executive position
at this company?

332
00:15:48,412 --> 00:15:50,437
Holy cow.
I'd be so happy.

333
00:15:50,715 --> 00:15:52,080
I wasn't talking to you,
pale face.

334
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,981
I know. I meant
I'd be happy for them.

335
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:58,249
What I'm offering is a ticket on a bullet
train straight to middle management.

336
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:00,552
Dwight, I know
these programs.

337
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:04,721
Every color is important, because
together we make a rainbow.

338
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:05,886
Yes.

339
00:16:05,963 --> 00:16:07,260
I'll slap you in the
face with a rainbow.

340
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,696
Mmm.

341
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,633
Speaking of rainbows, Oscar, you
are kind of a double minority.

342
00:16:14,505 --> 00:16:15,563
Gay.

343
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,370
So, we at Sabre could really
benefit from your perspective.

344
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:20,672
Dwight, we know
Kelly applied.

345
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,415
We're not going to cross her, no
matter how good the program is.

346
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,848
I can protect
you from Kelly.

347
00:16:27,985 --> 00:16:29,646
Will you get out
of here? Seriously.

348
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:33,651
For hobbies, yoga,
belly dancing,

349
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,518
snake-charming, beds of
nails, I like lying...

350
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:41,088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
This is Hidetosha Hacigawa.

351
00:16:41,165 --> 00:16:43,895
He would like to apply for the Sabre
Minority Executive Training Program,

352
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,196
Print In All
Colors initiative.

353
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,600
Dwight, what
are you doing?

354
00:16:46,671 --> 00:16:50,266
Helping heal America in a dramatic
fashion in the eleventh hour.

355
00:16:50,341 --> 00:16:52,275
God, I hate you so much.

356
00:16:52,343 --> 00:16:54,106
Caucasians.
Am I right?

357
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,673
Have a seat.
I'll translate.

358
00:16:56,747 --> 00:16:58,271
Why? I don't
need translator...

359
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,943
You don't know
what you need, just...

360
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,646
Why don't you tell me
a little about yourself, Hide.

361
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:27,041
Hey, Michael,
how you doing?

362
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:29,306
I don't know.
I don't know.

363
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:31,305
Can't really trust
my feelings anymore.

364
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:35,045
You know what, Michael? For what
it's worth, I was wrong, too.

365
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:36,677
I thought she was
interested in you.

366
00:17:36,754 --> 00:17:39,917
She suckered you, too?
Was it the cleavage?

367
00:17:39,991 --> 00:17:41,822
Yeah, and the shoulder cutouts. Yep.

368
00:17:41,892 --> 00:17:44,486
Michael, you know,
it's easy to get fooled.

369
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:48,828
Bob's warehouse guys flirt with me
all the time. It's mostly harmless.

370
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,029
Usually I don't
let it go too far.

371
00:17:51,102 --> 00:17:54,230
You know, when I tore
my scrote, I was...

372
00:17:55,273 --> 00:17:59,403
I was seeing this really hot urologist
about it and thought she was into me,

373
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:03,743
but now I think she was just doing
a bunch of stuff to bill my HMO.

374
00:18:03,814 --> 00:18:06,248
You know, she's touching
around down there.

375
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:07,978
It's easy to
get confused.

376
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:09,542
Michael, I think
Donna left this here.

377
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,714
Should I put it in the lost and found
for 14 days and then I can take it home?

378
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:13,848
God.

379
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,217
She left this here? Okay.

380
00:18:18,796 --> 00:18:21,526
Maybe she wants me to return
this to her at her work.

381
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,793
What? No.
No.

382
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:23,856
No.

383
00:18:23,934 --> 00:18:25,333
Yeah. This could
be a signal.

384
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:27,535
People don't just
take barrettes off.

385
00:18:27,605 --> 00:18:29,869
It's not a signal.
It's just a coincidence.

386
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,134
No, it's not even
a coincidence.

387
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:32,436
It's just something
that happened.

388
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,670
Michael.
Well...

389
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:38,181
She doesn't want you to return the
barrette. She's not interested in you.

390
00:18:39,383 --> 00:18:41,374
I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

391
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:44,910
I know. You're right. Thank
you. Thanks, everybody.

392
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,215
No.

393
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,154
Michael!

394
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,331
Michael!

395
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:04,702
Oh, you're still here.
I have your baguette.

396
00:19:06,577 --> 00:19:09,205
Everyone, it is my
pleasure to announce

397
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,511
our newest member of the Sabre
Minority Executive Training Program,

398
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,608
Kelly Rajanigandha Kapoor.

399
00:19:17,855 --> 00:19:19,982
They're going to be pretty
pleased in Tallahassee

400
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:22,491
that I snagged
an Indian for the program.

401
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,721
She'll be the first.
The program's mostly black.

402
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:26,660
It's almost too black.

403
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,900
That didn't sound right.

404
00:19:30,434 --> 00:19:33,028
And the best part is, is
that I get a business stipend

405
00:19:33,104 --> 00:19:35,004
to buy all new clothes.
- Awesome.

406
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,664
So you can totally buy
any of my old clothes

407
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:37,799
that I'm not gonna
need anymore.

408
00:19:37,875 --> 00:19:38,967
Oh, my God,
thank you so much.

409
00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:42,035
I love that denim jumpsuit
you have. How much?

410
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,972
Actually, I was thinking about clothes that
I was just going to give to Goodwill anyway.

411
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,779
Great.
Hey, kiddo.

412
00:19:49,053 --> 00:19:52,045
Congratulations are in order.
You deserve it.

413
00:19:55,793 --> 00:19:57,454
Thank you, Dwight.
Oh.

414
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,795
I'll never forget everything
that you've done for me.

415
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,593
Gosh.

416
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:03,098
Because I never
forget anything.

417
00:20:05,803 --> 00:20:10,035
Just once I would like to be a puppet
master and have nothing go wrong.

418
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:11,802
Is that too much to ask?

419
00:20:12,009 --> 00:20:16,412
You know what? Everybody told me that
you weren't interested. Everybody.

420
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,505
And I didn't believe them.

421
00:20:19,517 --> 00:20:21,280
And they were right.

422
00:20:22,586 --> 00:20:25,146
So, here's your barrette.

423
00:20:26,657 --> 00:20:29,091
No, you were right.

424
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,061
Who?
You were right.

425
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,322
About what?

426
00:20:34,398 --> 00:20:35,660
You were right.

427
00:20:42,373 --> 00:20:44,398
I'm sorry.
No. No. No.

428
00:20:44,475 --> 00:20:45,942
I'm...
Nope.

429
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,774
What happened?

430
00:20:53,851 --> 00:20:55,648
Kelly got into the
minority training program.

431
00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:00,019
Really? Oh, that's great.
That's such good news. I did it.

432
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:02,857
I kissed. We kissed.

433
00:21:02,927 --> 00:21:03,985
Oh, Michael...

434
00:21:04,061 --> 00:21:06,427
No, I'm serious.
The... This happened.

435
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:11,395
I went down to the parking lot and
I was... I returned her barrette.

436
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:16,631
We...

437
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,736
We did. Okay.
We did. We did.

438
00:21:20,511 --> 00:21:22,035
You know what?
It doesn't matter,

439
00:21:22,112 --> 00:21:25,741
because I know what happened,
and that is all that counts.

440
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:28,950
I did do it!
