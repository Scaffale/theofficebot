1
00:00:02,268 --> 00:00:03,902
Go.
In the door.

2
00:00:03,904 --> 00:00:04,937
Push!

3
00:00:04,939 --> 00:00:06,672
Oh, God.
Push.

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:07,706
No no no!
Turn it around.

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:08,707
Turn it around.
You're breaking...

6
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:09,708
Shove it through!

7
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,110
You shove it.

8
00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:12,311
Shove it back!

9
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:16,348
Here we go.

10
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,251
Don't break
the branches, Dwight.

11
00:00:21,154 --> 00:00:22,855
Ah, I got a splinter.

12
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,923
Well, suck it up.
We all have problems.

13
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:26,225
Hey, everybody!

14
00:00:26,227 --> 00:00:27,760
Look what we have!

15
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,064
Nice, huh?

16
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,766
I've got it leveraged.
Push!

17
00:00:33,768 --> 00:00:37,236
One, two, three!

18
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,437
Ah!

19
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:41,440
Merry Christmas!

20
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,446
Did it work?

21
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:22,748
Well, sort of.

22
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,617
Why did you get it so big?

23
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,986
That's what she said.

24
00:01:27,988 --> 00:01:30,189
And B: I wanted it
to be impressive.

25
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,457
The biggest day of the year

26
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,025
deserves the
biggest tree of the year.

27
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:35,427
But what are we gonna do
with this hacked off part?

28
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,497
Well, that is perfectly good
mini tree, Kevin.

29
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:41,500
And we are going
to sell that to charity.

30
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,502
That's what Christmas
is all about.

31
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:53,145
So this year,
for the first time ever,

32
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,714
I got Pam in Secret Santa.

33
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,316
And I got her this teapot

34
00:01:57,318 --> 00:01:59,485
which I know she really wants.

35
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,853
So she can make tea at her desk,

36
00:02:00,855 --> 00:02:03,555
but I'm also gonna stuff it
with some inside jokes.

37
00:02:03,557 --> 00:02:07,326
Like, this is my
high school yearbook photo.

38
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,727
She saw it at the party.

39
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,963
And it really makes her laugh.

40
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:12,364
I'm not sure why.

41
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,299
Um, what else?

42
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:17,169
Ooh, this is a hot sauce packet.

43
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:20,139
She put this on a hot dog
a couple years ago

44
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:23,108
because she thought
it was catsup.

45
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:27,112
And it was really funny,
so I kept the other two.

46
00:02:27,114 --> 00:02:29,481
This would take a little
too long to explain.

47
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,250
So I won't.

48
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:33,152
And this is a card.

49
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:37,689
Because Christmas is the time
to tell people how you feel.

50
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,027
Is there anything we're missing?

51
00:02:42,029 --> 00:02:43,896
Phyllis, you got the lights?

52
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,497
Yes, I got
those cute little ones.

53
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,800
Do you think I should have
gotten the big ones?

54
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,702
We'll see.

55
00:02:50,704 --> 00:02:53,906
Angela drafted me into
the party planning committee.

56
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:55,073
Her memo said that we need to

57
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,410
prepare for every
possible disaster.

58
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:03,515
Which, to me,
seems... excessive.

59
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,984
Merry Christmas!

60
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,453
Ho ho ho!
Pimp!

61
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,155
I'm kidding!

62
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,156
What do we got?
What do we got?

63
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:12,524
How many plates are we getting?

64
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,692
50.
Ooh, double it.

65
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:14,993
Double everything.
Double ice cream.

66
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:16,728
Double napkins.
Double it.

67
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,463
On me.

68
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,665
It was a tough year.

69
00:03:19,667 --> 00:03:21,366
I had to fire somebody
this year.

70
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,902
This party has to really rock.

71
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:25,938
Check it out.

72
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,573
Christmas bonus, 3,000 Gs.

73
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:31,243
I got this for helping
save the company money.

74
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,244
So I guess some good came out of

75
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,812
firing Devin after all.

76
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,815
Maybe I should call him,
tell him that.

77
00:03:36,817 --> 00:03:38,717
I want people to cut loose.

78
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,851
I want people...

79
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,420
making out in closets.

80
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,691
I want people
hanging from the ceilings,

81
00:03:45,693 --> 00:03:46,959
lampshades on the heads.

82
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,028
I want it to be
a Playboy Mansion party.

83
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,964
And also, I want you to know,

84
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:52,965
and spread the word,

85
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,233
that I will have
my digital camera.

86
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:57,369
And I will be taking pictures
all the way.

87
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,104
And the best and craziest
thing that happens

88
00:03:59,106 --> 00:04:00,839
will be on the cover
of the newsletter.

89
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,907
Incentive.

90
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:03,108
You do realize

91
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,243
that we can't serve liquor
at the party.

92
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:06,678
Yeah, I know.
Dammit.

93
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,614
Stupid corporate wet blankets.

94
00:04:08,616 --> 00:04:09,982
Like booze ever killed anybody.

95
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:13,318
One, two, three.

96
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:17,522
You guys should use
a hand truck.

97
00:04:17,524 --> 00:04:18,824
Do we have one?

98
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:20,792
No.

99
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,497
Will you help me?

100
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,232
No!

101
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:29,234
No way.
It... no.

102
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:30,402
Come on, Mike,
let me borrow the hat.

103
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,403
For just a couple of hours.

104
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,404
You wanna be Santa?
Yeah.

105
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,939
Have you ever seen Santa?

106
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,575
Yeah, I've seen Santa.
Who cares?

107
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,709
Well, I'm sorry.

108
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:39,177
It just doesn't work.

109
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:41,647
Michael, I would like
to be the elf.

110
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:44,783
That makes sense,
because he has elfish features.

111
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,086
Okay, everyone, listen up!

112
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:50,756
It is time to get your presents,

113
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:57,429
wrap them, and place them
under the tree like so.

114
00:04:57,431 --> 00:04:59,131
If you do not get your present

115
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,632
wrapped and under the tree

116
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:03,168
within the next five minutes...

117
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,904
you will be disqualified
from Secret Santa.

118
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,739
All right?
No exceptions.

119
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,974
Except Michael.

120
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,375
I got Angela.

121
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:14,813
She's into
these posters of babies

122
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:16,114
dressed as adults.

123
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:17,783
I got her one of those.

124
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:21,019
I felt kind of weird
buying that.

125
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,154
I got Creed.

126
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:23,255
And to tell you the truth,

127
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,923
I don't know
anything about Creed.

128
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:26,058
I know his name's Creed.

129
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,693
I know he works
right over there.

130
00:05:27,695 --> 00:05:29,594
I think he's Irish and I...

131
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,431
I got him this
shamrock keychain.

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,636
I got myself for Secret Santa.

133
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,371
I was supposed to tell somebody,

134
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:40,872
but I didn't.

135
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,675
You get something
good this year?

136
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:46,611
Uh, I think I did
a pretty good job.

137
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,980
Yeah?
Who'd you have?

138
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,682
I can't tell you,
'cause it's a secret.

139
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,517
I think I got something
pretty nice for my guy.

140
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,819
Yeah?
Spent a lot of dough.

141
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:55,320
A lot of dough.
Wow.

142
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:57,723
Well, there's a $20 limit,
right?

143
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:59,558
Yeah, I wanted this party
to be really special

144
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,360
so I sorta went
above and beyond.

145
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,061
That's great... well,
don't tell me who it is...

146
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,596
It was Ryan!

147
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,499
Yep, I have Ryan.

148
00:06:07,501 --> 00:06:09,067
Gather 'round.

149
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:10,535
Secret Santa.
Let's go.

150
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,237
Let's go.
Come on.

151
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,172
Stanley... no, I'm gonna
handle the cord, okay?

152
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,374
Safety reasons.

153
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:16,775
I know how to plug something in.

154
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,210
I wanna do it.

155
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:21,646
All right, let's count it down

156
00:06:21,648 --> 00:06:22,714
like Rockefeller Center.

157
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,549
Ready?

158
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:27,753
Three, two, one.

159
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:30,555
Yeah!

160
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:31,957
Not great.

161
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,960
Sorry, everybody.

162
00:06:34,962 --> 00:06:36,962
I think the tree looks nice.

163
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,864
Hey, I could get some
flares from my car.

164
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,998
No, no.

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,032
Shake it off, everybody.

166
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:42,467
Just... let's do
Secret Santa.

167
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,337
Presents are the best way
to show someone

168
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,671
how much you care.

169
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:48,640
It is like this tangible thing

170
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:50,409
that you can point to and say,

171
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,144
"Hey, man, I love you...

172
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:53,812
this many dollars worth."

173
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,181
First present, Oscar.

174
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,720
A shower radio, neat.

175
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:02,721
Oh, great, that was from me.

176
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:03,789
Thanks, Kelly.

177
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,123
You know, I was
gonna get one of these...

178
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,158
Okay, okay, that's enough.

179
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,659
Let's keep it moving on.

180
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,794
Jim.

181
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,895
Oh, cool.

182
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,167
That's from me.

183
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:18,170
Great.
Where'd you get it?

184
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:20,772
I don't know,
it was so long ago.

185
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,941
He obviously forgot
to get me something.

186
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,075
And then he went into his closet

187
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:26,445
and dug out this little number.

188
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,013
And then threw it in a bag.

189
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,148
Yep, that's exactly
what happened.

190
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:32,317
Pam.

191
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,492
Oh, my God!

192
00:07:42,328 --> 00:07:44,029
Thank you very much, Santa.

193
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,431
Whoever you are.
It's awesome.

194
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:47,999
There's a little more to it.

195
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:49,100
All right, next.

196
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,235
Ryan.

197
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:51,336
No!

198
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,477
Whoa.
Video iPod.

199
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,313
Ho ho, wow, geez.

200
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:02,481
Somebody really got carried away

201
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,949
with the spirit of Christmas.

202
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,250
It was me.

203
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,985
I got carried away
with the spirit.

204
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:10,355
Wasn't there a $20 limit
on the gifts?

205
00:08:10,357 --> 00:08:12,090
This is 400 bucks.

206
00:08:12,092 --> 00:08:13,792
You don't know that.

207
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,193
Yeah, you left the price on.

208
00:08:15,195 --> 00:08:17,062
I did... what?
Oh, shoot.

209
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,096
Wow, okay.

210
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,631
Well, who cares?

211
00:08:19,633 --> 00:08:20,899
It doesn't matter what I spent.

212
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,368
What matters is that
Christmas is fun, right?

213
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,371
Michael.

214
00:08:26,373 --> 00:08:28,974
Oh, hey.
For me?

215
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:31,610
What is in here?

216
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,447
Oh, come on.

217
00:08:35,449 --> 00:08:36,882
I knitted it for you.

218
00:08:36,884 --> 00:08:38,717
An oven mitt?

219
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,389
So Phyllis is basically saying,

220
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:45,557
"Hey, Michael, I know
you did a lot

221
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,925
"to help the office this year.

222
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:48,226
"But I only care about you

223
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,896
a homemade oven mitt's
worth."

224
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:53,331
I gave Ryan an iPod.

225
00:08:55,668 --> 00:08:59,137
Uh, should we just keep
opening up the presents?

226
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,472
We don't do anything

227
00:09:00,474 --> 00:09:02,274
until Michael gives us
further instructions.

228
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,580
I got it!

229
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:12,017
We are going to turn
Secret Santa

230
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,885
into Yankee Swap!

231
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:15,453
What is Yankee Swap?

232
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:18,089
One person chooses a gift.

233
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,659
The next person can either
choose a gift

234
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:23,528
or steal that person's gift.

235
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,363
If your gift gets stolen,
then you can

236
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:28,099
steal someone else's gift
or choose a new gift.

237
00:09:28,101 --> 00:09:30,268
I thought that was called
Nasty Christmas.

238
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,137
Yeah, we call it White Elephant.

239
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,738
Well, I call it fun!

240
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,040
Why are we doing this?

241
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:37,142
Because it's better.
Because it's more special.

242
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,243
It sounds mean.

243
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,377
Shut...

244
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,645
No... it's not.

245
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:41,713
Okay, just give it a shot.

246
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,781
Michael should have asked

247
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,716
the party planning
committee first.

248
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,850
He's not just supposed to just

249
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,153
spring things on us
out of nowhere.

250
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,560
Okay, Meredith is up first.

251
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,228
Here's the deal.

252
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,997
You can either pick a new gift,

253
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,266
or you can steal
somebody else's gift

254
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,400
they've already gotten.

255
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:03,435
Like the oven mitt.

256
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,371
I'll take the teapot.

257
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:07,539
Oh, shouldn't we...

258
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,374
I bought that
specifically for Pam.

259
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,542
Yaaankee Swap.

260
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:12,644
That's what makes it fun.

261
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,212
Pam, you can steal
the oven mitt now.

262
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,513
I'll take the iPod.

263
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:18,617
And I have to give it to her?
I don't have a choice?

264
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,151
Yes, now you can steal
the oven mitt,

265
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,886
the old shirt,
or the shower radio.

266
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,622
Or pick a new gift.

267
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:36,368
That was meant for Kelly.

268
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,535
Yeah, I figured.

269
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,577
I think this is going great.

270
00:10:53,686 --> 00:10:54,919
Yikes.

271
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,722
Well, it's for Angela, so...

272
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:01,626
That's like the creepiest thing

273
00:11:01,628 --> 00:11:03,194
that I've ever seen.

274
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:04,295
Angela, you're up.

275
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,300
I'll take the poster.

276
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:13,972
Some people like these.

277
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,974
I will steal the iPod.

278
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:18,476
Everyone wants the iPod.

279
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:20,078
It is a huge hit.

280
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,614
It is almost
a Christmas miracle.

281
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,317
Ah, well, Oscar,
you little gourmand,

282
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,086
you have the next turn.

283
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:31,423
I'll take the teapot.

284
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:32,457
Dammit.

285
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:33,925
Okay, moving along,

286
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,293
Meredith, let's go.

287
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,429
I really want the iPod.

288
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,763
A-ca-ca-ca.
It's already been stolen

289
00:11:38,765 --> 00:11:40,198
this round, pick something else.

290
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,500
I hope nobody takes this baby,

291
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:43,802
'cause this is great.

292
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:47,138
Wow, look at
that fine craftsmanship.

293
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,541
Somebody really put
a lot of work into that.

294
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,642
It's beautiful.

295
00:11:50,644 --> 00:11:52,377
I'll take the oven mitt.

296
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,814
Ssssssssucka!

297
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:58,883
See, I wanted somebody
to take it.

298
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,885
Boom.
Reverse psychology.

299
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:03,888
Reverse psychology
is an awesome tool.

300
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,490
I don't know if you guys
know about it.

301
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,393
But, basically,
you make someone think

302
00:12:08,395 --> 00:12:11,096
the opposite
of what you believe.

303
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,733
And that tricks them
into doing something stupid.

304
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,967
Works like a charm.

305
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,442
In addition to these
paint ball pellets,

306
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:27,178
your gift includes
two paintball lessons

307
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,513
with Dwight Shroot.

308
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,449
You and me, Michael.
Yes!

309
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:36,855
Who wants to take
paintball lessons?

310
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,323
How is that better than an iPod?

311
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,825
I never said it was better
than an iPod.

312
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:45,930
Michael keeps bragging
about his iPod.

313
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:47,599
But, you know what?

314
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,000
Two paintball lessons
with someone

315
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:50,068
as experienced as I am,

316
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,537
is worth, easily,
like, two grand.

317
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:54,572
Take, that, Saddam.

318
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,474
Last gift, Kevin.

319
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,576
I want the footbath.

320
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,114
That's the thing
I bought myself.

321
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,550
I'm really psyched to use it.

322
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,389
Maybe I should have
taken the iPod.

323
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:15,293
Oh, shoot.

324
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,062
Pam, steal something
or pick the final gift.

325
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,165
I want the iPod.
Dammit.

326
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,466
Sure you don't want the teapot?

327
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:24,769
I mean, it's an iPod.

328
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,904
Right.
Sorry.

329
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:27,405
No no, definitely.

330
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:31,376
Okay, well, I guess I will take

331
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,611
that book of short stories.

332
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,779
Yes!
There you go.

333
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:38,082
I want the teapot.
Gracias.

334
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:39,417
You gotta be kidding me.

335
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:44,355
Yankee Swap is like
Machiavelli meets...

336
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:47,592
Christmas.

337
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,829
What is she so upset about?

338
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,797
Maybe because you hated
her present so much.

339
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,600
Come on... I think Yankee Swap
was a big hit.

340
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,868
I think it was a success.

341
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,969
And I'm the one who ended up

342
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,437
with Dwight's stupid
paint ball pellets.

343
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:00,738
Yeah, but Michael, the point is

344
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,674
is that we all bought gifts
for specific people.

345
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,442
And you should have just
bought a $20 gift

346
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:05,543
like everyone else.

347
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:07,412
Well, I didn't!

348
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:09,581
I got a big bonus
because I fired Devin,

349
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,115
and I used the money
to buy something awesome.

350
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:12,183
Sue me!

351
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,787
You got a bonus check?

352
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:16,888
How much?

353
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,090
Uh, it wasn't...

354
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,625
It wasn't that much.

355
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:22,293
It was 3,000.

356
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,062
All right, I'm done now.

357
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,967
Unbelievable.

358
00:14:28,969 --> 00:14:31,069
I do the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done

359
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,770
for these people
and they freak out.

360
00:14:32,772 --> 00:14:34,939
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.

361
00:14:34,941 --> 00:14:36,374
Sorry your party's so lame.

362
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:41,880
That comes to
166.41.

363
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:43,314
All right, now,
you're the expert.

364
00:14:43,316 --> 00:14:45,783
Is this enough to get
20 people plastered?

365
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,354
15 bottles of vodka?

366
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:50,688
Yeah, that should do it.

367
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,457
Cool cool, box it up.

368
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:04,068
I bought this teapot for Pam,

369
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,436
and I know she really wants it.

370
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,537
So can I trade you for it?

371
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,705
No trades.
Come on.

372
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:10,375
It's a shamrock keychain.
Good luck.

373
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:12,644
A real man makes his own luck.

374
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,445
Billy Zane, Titanic.

375
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:15,980
Look, it has
sentimental value, Dwight.

376
00:15:15,982 --> 00:15:17,815
Can I buy it from you?

377
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:19,984
No, I want it.
I'm going to use it.

378
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,019
You don't even drink tea.

379
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,488
True, but I get
sinus infections.

380
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:24,956
And sinus infections
can be cured

381
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,125
by making a tea from
green tea leaf stems

382
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,694
and pouring it directly
into your nose like so.

383
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,299
To think that my gift to Pam

384
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,734
will be used for that...

385
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,869
it's a little too much
to handle.

386
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:39,771
It's a little too much
to handle.

387
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,105
This is awesome.

388
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:42,807
I know, it's totally
gonna change the way

389
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:43,942
I work out.

390
00:15:43,944 --> 00:15:45,443
Yeah, and I was gonna get you
one of these

391
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,445
for Christmas.
Now I don't have to.

392
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,546
I'm gonna save a ton of money.

393
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,681
So what are you gonna
get me instead?

394
00:15:49,683 --> 00:15:50,815
I don't know.

395
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,017
Probably like
a sweater or something.

396
00:15:55,788 --> 00:16:00,291
Uh oh, looks like
Santa was a little naughty.

397
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:02,627
What is that?

398
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,996
This is Christmas spirit.

399
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:06,998
As in spirits.
Booze.

400
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,599
We can drink?

401
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,935
We're really not supposed
to serve alcohol.

402
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,136
Zip it, Toby.

403
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:14,539
Just... I mean,
it's a party, come on.

404
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:16,174
If I can't throw
a good party for my employees,

405
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:17,342
then I am a terrible boss.

406
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,179
Who wants a drink?
Me, please.

407
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,380
Go!
Here we go!

408
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,117
The deal is that
this is my last hurrah.

409
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,119
'Cause I made a New Year's
resolution

410
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,922
that I'm not gonna drink anymore

411
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,256
during the week.

412
00:16:32,258 --> 00:16:33,958
Hi, guys.

413
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,460
Uh, does everyone
know my boyfriend

414
00:16:35,462 --> 00:16:36,561
Bob Vance?

415
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,029
Kevin Malone.

416
00:16:38,031 --> 00:16:40,098
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

417
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,232
Stanley Hudson.

418
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,034
Bob Vance.
Vance refrigeration.

419
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:44,435
Ryan Howard.
Bob Vance.

420
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:45,603
Vance refrigeration.

421
00:16:46,772 --> 00:16:47,905
What line of work
are you in, Bob?

422
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,140
What line of work
are you in, Bob?

423
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,012
I got... I lost Culpepper at TO,
it was over, man.

424
00:16:54,014 --> 00:16:56,080
Oh yeah, I need McNabb
and Deon Branch

425
00:16:56,082 --> 00:16:57,849
to have big games
or else I'm done.

426
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,350
It's possible.

427
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,352
I can't believe you traded
Sean Alexander, man.

428
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,553
I had to, I needed defense.

429
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,088
Come on!
Sean Alexander?

430
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,456
He's the best back
in the league!

431
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,892
Defense.
Oh, no, that's not worth it.

432
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:08,926
It is worth it.

433
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:10,895
Are you kidding?
You wait.

434
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,831
Anybody making out in here?

435
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,900
No yet, give it time.

436
00:17:15,902 --> 00:17:17,001
Oh, hey, Ebenezer.

437
00:17:17,003 --> 00:17:18,002
Boink.

438
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:19,737
Okay, how's it going in here?

439
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:20,905
We're running low on cups.

440
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,206
Do you want me to just
run out and...

441
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,307
No no no no no.

442
00:17:23,309 --> 00:17:24,776
We'll find some.
Don't leave the party.

443
00:17:24,778 --> 00:17:27,578
One, two, three!

444
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:32,083
Gaah!
Ho ho ho!

445
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,752
Kudos to Ryan,
king of the party committee!

446
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:37,855
Oh, no, I really
did not do anything.

447
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,257
No false modesty, my friend.

448
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,196
You know, you don't have to
answer calls

449
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,597
during a party.

450
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:48,666
Just thought you should know.

451
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,836
No, I was just, um,
checking out my present.

452
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,741
I traded with Dwight.

453
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,610
Um, just... I figured,
you know,

454
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,879
you went to a lot of trouble
and that means a lot.

455
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:06,350
And also Roy got me an iPod

456
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:09,620
or was going
to get me an iPod, so...

457
00:18:09,622 --> 00:18:11,622
Well, either way.

458
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,026
This is an amazing gift
because it comes with

459
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:16,494
bonus gifts.

460
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,362
Look inside.

461
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:24,836
Oh, my God!

462
00:18:24,838 --> 00:18:27,338
The yearbook picture!

463
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,775
Yeah, I think I made
the right choice.

464
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:34,512
Oh, my God.
This is incredible.

465
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:36,214
Is this the bottle timer?

466
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,515
I didn't think you
were gonna get that one.

467
00:18:37,517 --> 00:18:39,117
I really didn't know.

468
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,420
This is so awesome.

469
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:43,621
Not bad... and if it couldn't
go to Ryan,

470
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,990
you are the guy
I'd want it to go to.

471
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,291
Thank you.
You're welcome.

472
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,360
Merry Christmas, Asswipe.
No way!

473
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:52,797
Oh, you're kidding me.
Packer!

474
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,499
Yes!

475
00:18:54,501 --> 00:18:56,901
Todd Packer,
ladies and gentlemen.

476
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,336
What's up, my nerds?

477
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:00,571
Check it out!
Oh, no.

478
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:01,973
Oh, look at that!

479
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:03,741
Icing on the cake!

480
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:06,244
Pacman need a drinky.

481
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,245
Oh, let's fix you up.

482
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,646
Who wants to fix up... Toby?

483
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:09,981
Toby's gonna fix you up.

484
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,649
Whoo!
Yeah.

485
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:19,323
Daryl, here you go.

486
00:19:19,325 --> 00:19:20,391
You earned it.

487
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:23,161
No no no no no,
I really want you to have it.

488
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:25,563
All right.
Thanks, man.

489
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,532
Hey, Merry Christmas.

490
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:31,402
Whose butt is that?

491
00:19:31,404 --> 00:19:33,204
Mine.

492
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:35,239
Oh, how did I not guess that?

493
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:38,242
Lampshade on the head!

494
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:39,744
It's happening!

495
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,257
Hey.
Oh, hello there.

496
00:19:54,593 --> 00:19:56,027
What are you doing?

497
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:58,229
I don't know.

498
00:19:58,231 --> 00:20:00,198
You shouldn't do
things like that.

499
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,832
The man is supposed to do that.

500
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:16,080
Thanks for the party, Michael.

501
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,516
Listen up, we're going to
Poor Richards.

502
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,984
Who's in?
I'm in.

503
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:23,087
Yes.
Michael?

504
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,822
Poor Richards?

505
00:20:24,824 --> 00:20:26,290
Yeah, that sounds good.

506
00:20:26,292 --> 00:20:28,759
Christmas is awesome.

507
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:29,961
First of all,

508
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:32,663
you get to spend time
with people you love.

509
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:34,498
Secondly, you can get drunk

510
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,234
and no one can say anything.

511
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:38,736
Third, you give presents.

512
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:39,737
What's better
than giving presents?

513
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,273
And fourth, getting presents.

514
00:20:42,275 --> 00:20:43,307
So four things.

515
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:44,609
Not bad for one day.

516
00:20:44,611 --> 00:20:47,945
It's really
the greatest day of all time.

517
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:52,883
Hey, Meredith, heading over
to Poor Richard's?

518
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,553
Yep.
Cool cool cool.

519
00:20:55,555 --> 00:20:58,022
You need a ride?

520
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:09,967
All right, let's head out.

521
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,769
Sounds good.
Do you have a coat?

522
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,104
Yeah.

523
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,672
Ohhhhhhkay.
