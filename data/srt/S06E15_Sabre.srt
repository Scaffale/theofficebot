1
00:00:02,768 --> 00:00:05,066
Oh, yeah! I've got a big box, yes I do!

2
00:00:05,137 --> 00:00:06,934
I've got a big box,
how about you?

3
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,270
I've got a big box, yes I do,
I've got a big box, how about you?

4
00:00:10,342 --> 00:00:11,639
I think you don't know
what you're saying.

5
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:16,579
It is "from Sah-bray," our new
owner, and it is "to Sah-bray." Us!

6
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:19,773
I wonder what's inside.
Scissor me.

7
00:00:24,956 --> 00:00:26,890
Dunder Mifflin was
recently bought

8
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:29,950
by an electronics
company named Sah-bray.

9
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:33,862
They stepped in at the eleventh
hour and they saved our asses.

10
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:37,230
Although David Wallace said
that we were the one branch

11
00:00:37,302 --> 00:00:39,099
that was actually
working right,

12
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:41,469
so we probably could've
saved our own asses.

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,565
We didn't need them
touching our asses.

14
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:47,176
Wow!

15
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:48,640
Awesome.

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,744
For Accounting,
a brand new printer,

17
00:00:52,317 --> 00:00:57,311
and for the sales staff,
a new fax machine.

18
00:00:57,823 --> 00:01:00,553
This cord has
Creed written all over it.

19
00:01:00,826 --> 00:01:05,923
And whoever would like
a brand new scanner

20
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,530
can come visit it
in my office. Thank you.

21
00:01:08,667 --> 00:01:10,032
Here we go.

22
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:15,399
Cool. What next?

23
00:01:15,474 --> 00:01:17,066
Guys, um, who's Gabe?

24
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,133
This note says to
put the box aside

25
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,237
for a Gabe Lewis,
who's coming tomorrow.

26
00:01:24,683 --> 00:01:27,846
Okay, everybody, listen up.
I have some bad news.

27
00:01:28,353 --> 00:01:30,218
Due to circumstances
beyond my control...

28
00:01:30,288 --> 00:01:31,778
Impulsivity and
inattention to detail...

29
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,620
Hey, hey.

30
00:01:33,925 --> 00:01:36,587
I have opened a box which
should not have been opened...

31
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:38,526
Terrible mistake.
...and distributed things

32
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:39,894
which should not
have been distributed.

33
00:01:39,965 --> 00:01:41,023
Un-distributable.

34
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:43,431
Well, maybe we can
put the box back together.

35
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,333
Impossible.
He opened it like an ape.

36
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,294
I think we can do it.

37
00:01:49,908 --> 00:01:51,273
Yeah, yeah.

38
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:56,711
Did we try printer first,
shredder at an angle?

39
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:58,715
Yeah. Fax cable, then
the scanner upside-down?

40
00:01:58,783 --> 00:01:59,772
Yes.

41
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:01,910
Have you tried
making everything smaller?

42
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,350
And...

43
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:10,584
Wow! Really nice job!

44
00:02:10,662 --> 00:02:13,927
This group of people, when
they put their minds together,

45
00:02:13,999 --> 00:02:16,524
they can do
something great.

46
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:19,798
And I think that you should
all be proud of yourselves.

47
00:02:21,773 --> 00:02:23,172
Oh, Michael!

48
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:26,074
All right, relax. We can
do it. We just did it.

49
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:28,908
So, we can do this again.
Erin, scissor me, please?

50
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,969
No, don't!

51
00:02:30,048 --> 00:02:31,515
Thank you. Oh!
Got it. Okay.

52
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,631
All right, he's on his
way up. Okay, we ready?

53
00:02:58,076 --> 00:02:59,543
What do you want us to do?

54
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:01,010
Why do I have to
explain everything?

55
00:03:01,079 --> 00:03:03,138
Because we're usually
not on the same page.

56
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:11,752
Oh. Okay.

57
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,423
And to you.

58
00:03:15,393 --> 00:03:17,884
Gabe seems tall.
Hope we get along.

59
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:20,059
I had a very good thing going
with David Wallace.

60
00:03:20,131 --> 00:03:22,827
<i>He was a good guy. He was
somebody I could trust.</i>

61
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:24,664
There he is.
You can really see

62
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:27,330
that he is okay
taking a picture with me,

63
00:03:27,772 --> 00:03:30,935
even though I was there
for disciplinary reasons.

64
00:03:32,444 --> 00:03:34,844
Welcome. Scranton hotdog from Scranton?

65
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:36,881
You know what, Dwight? Let's
give him a minute to settle in.

66
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:38,540
Shall we?
Okay.

67
00:03:39,017 --> 00:03:41,884
Hi. My name
is Gabe Lewis.

68
00:03:41,953 --> 00:03:44,387
I am Coordinating Director
for Emerging Regions.

69
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:47,789
Hello, Gabe. I am
Michael Scott, co-manager.

70
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:50,350
This is my protégé,
Jim Halpert.

71
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:52,353
Co-manager, actually.

72
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,419
In training.

73
00:03:53,498 --> 00:03:55,966
Trained. Loving it.
Good at it, so...

74
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:58,502
We are very impressed
with this branch,

75
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,970
and we are so excited
about this merger.

76
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:03,266
We're very excited,
too, aren't we, guys?

77
00:04:03,341 --> 00:04:04,899
Right?
- So excited.

78
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:07,809
We have a little song
prepared for you.

79
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,204
Actually,
if you don't mind,

80
00:04:10,281 --> 00:04:12,613
I would love to put this
on the Sabre website.

81
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:13,844
Sabre.

82
00:04:14,886 --> 00:04:16,046
Sabre. Sabre.
It's Sabre.

83
00:04:16,121 --> 00:04:17,884
It's Sabre.
Oh. Of course.

84
00:04:17,956 --> 00:04:18,945
Sabre.

85
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:20,355
Good.
Take it away, guys.

86
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,151
Okay.

87
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,426
<i>Hopped off
the train in Scranton, PA</i>

88
00:04:30,502 --> 00:04:32,936
<i>Another cloudy gray afternoon</i>

89
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:36,203
<i>Jumped in the cab Here
you are for the first time</i>

90
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:38,765
<i>Look to the right And you
see the Electric City sign</i>

91
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:43,177
<i>This is gonna be a good day
For Dunder Mifflin and Sah-bray</i>

92
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,179
Sabre.
It's Sabre.

93
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:50,277
<i>Dunder Mifflin and Sabre</i>

94
00:04:50,355 --> 00:04:55,588
<i>So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Dunder
Mifflin is a part of Sah-bray</i>

95
00:04:56,094 --> 00:05:00,895
<i>So yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Dunder Mifflin is a part of Sabre</i>

96
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:02,660
<i>Dunder Mifflin
is a part of Sabre</i>

97
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,129
You sure it's Sabre?

98
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:07,496
Hey.
Thank you.

99
00:05:07,672 --> 00:05:10,766
Hey, we should be fine
if we leave around 11:20.

100
00:05:11,843 --> 00:05:15,040
Oh, you MapQuested it.
It's four blocks away.

101
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:16,239
Well, now we
won't get lost.

102
00:05:17,148 --> 00:05:20,140
Or we could drive,
and that takes one minute.

103
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,713
We found a great
local daycare.

104
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:26,780
It's rated really high by all
the local parenting websites,

105
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:29,019
but that means it's also
really hard to get into.

106
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:32,291
Turns out a lot of parents want
the very best for their children.

107
00:05:32,363 --> 00:05:33,387
That's weird.

108
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,990
We're hoping our interview
seals the deal.

109
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,659
But if not,
there's always the Army.

110
00:05:39,738 --> 00:05:41,205
The infantry.

111
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,968
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

112
00:05:48,146 --> 00:05:50,239
<i>So you've just
been bought by Sabre.</i>

113
00:05:50,315 --> 00:05:52,283
<i>You've probably got
a lot of questions.</i>

114
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,047
<i>Hi, I'm Christian Slater.
What's it like to work for Sabre?</i>

115
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:58,823
<i>Let's find out together.</i>

116
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:01,288
<i>Working at Sabre means
taking on the challenge</i>

117
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:03,884
<i>of the road that
rises to meet you.</i>

118
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,425
<i>Sabre is respecting the past, but
opening the window to the future.</i>

119
00:06:13,404 --> 00:06:18,239
<i>Have you ever tasted a
rainbow? At Sabre, you will.</i>

120
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:25,307
<i>You'll find it easy to embrace
the Sabre spirit. Welcome.</i>

121
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,580
<i>We're very excited to go
on this journey with you.</i>

122
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,150
<i>So, you've been shown
a nonsensical video.</i>

123
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:35,715
You're probably wondering, "What's
going on?" Well, you're not alone.

124
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:39,529
Wow. Really terrific.

125
00:06:40,298 --> 00:06:42,698
Most of our business comes
from selling printers,

126
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:45,702
so don't think of yourselves
as paper salesmen anymore,

127
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,261
but as printer salesmen
who also sell paper.

128
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:50,065
Perfect.

129
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:52,209
No. Don't like that.

130
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:56,169
At Sabre, we really encourage
honest communication.

131
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,846
You should always feel free
to express your thoughts...

132
00:06:58,917 --> 00:07:01,647
Talk about vacation days!

133
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:03,845
We have a policy
here at Sabre

134
00:07:03,922 --> 00:07:06,049
where we are allowed
to take two weeks.

135
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,524
But I banked six weeks.

136
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:10,458
I already booked
a Great Lakes cruise.

137
00:07:10,528 --> 00:07:12,325
Hey, who the hell's
going through our stuff?

138
00:07:12,397 --> 00:07:15,423
Actually, that's Nick.
He's your new IT guy.

139
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,457
He's setting up
a site blocker,

140
00:07:17,535 --> 00:07:19,662
mostly blocking
the inappropriate sites,

141
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:23,173
and then there are the time-wasting
sites like Twitter, YouTube.

142
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,799
We are blocking
those as well.

143
00:07:25,476 --> 00:07:27,239
No. Don't like that.

144
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,538
Okay, did everyone get one?

145
00:07:29,848 --> 00:07:33,944
With these bottles, we eliminate
the need for plastic water bottles,

146
00:07:34,018 --> 00:07:37,044
which are the scourge
of the environment.

147
00:07:37,856 --> 00:07:40,256
We will still get to use the
little cups, though, right?

148
00:07:40,325 --> 00:07:42,418
Little cups?
Like paper or plastic?

149
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,824
I don't know what
they're made of.

150
00:07:43,895 --> 00:07:46,989
They're two-ounce paper cups dipped
in plastic. He goes through 20 a day.

151
00:07:47,065 --> 00:07:48,726
Okay. Well,
I bet you could fit

152
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,768
20 little cups of water
in your aluminum bottle.

153
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:52,598
You know what
can't fit in a bottle

154
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:54,604
are the 20 little trips
I take to the cooler,

155
00:07:54,672 --> 00:07:56,572
and the 20 little scans
I do of everybody

156
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,108
to make sure everything's
running smoothly,

157
00:07:58,176 --> 00:08:01,202
and the 20 little conversations
that I have with Stanley.

158
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,337
That's okay.

159
00:08:02,413 --> 00:08:04,643
There is a small part
of me that is actually

160
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:07,276
very excited about
this new company.

161
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:13,282
But 70% of me is water, and
the other part, the real part,

162
00:08:13,358 --> 00:08:15,690
the part that has
feelings and emotions

163
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,228
and thoughts and
makes decisions,

164
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:20,960
and, if I can be crass,
makes babies,

165
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:26,095
that part thinks that
all of these changes suck...

166
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,937
Really?

167
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:37,076
You don't have enough water
in there? Your stomach?

168
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:43,018
What?

169
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:44,247
Looks like we kicked it.

170
00:08:44,689 --> 00:08:48,125
<i>I miss the old

171
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:52,619
Too much change is not a
good thing. Ask the climate.

172
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:56,591
I don't want to
appear ungrateful

173
00:08:56,668 --> 00:08:58,295
for everything
Sabre is doing for us.

174
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:00,837
I don't get that sense
at all from you, so...

175
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,167
Well, you should
have a little,

176
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,969
but it's great
that you don't,

177
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:08,342
because I am trying to
embrace all of these changes.

178
00:09:08,413 --> 00:09:11,075
But I'm... I'll be honest,
I'm having trouble

179
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:12,639
wrapping my head
around a couple of them.

180
00:09:12,717 --> 00:09:14,014
Which ones?

181
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:15,450
All of them.

182
00:09:15,987 --> 00:09:18,251
Well, I wish that
I could do something,

183
00:09:18,323 --> 00:09:20,518
but it's kind of policy,
you know?

184
00:09:20,591 --> 00:09:21,751
Above my pay grade.

185
00:09:23,328 --> 00:09:25,728
So, maybe we should call.
We should call someone.

186
00:09:25,797 --> 00:09:29,733
I could help. I'm good with
bosses. Call one of the higher ups?

187
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:32,359
You know what?
Let me see what I can do.

188
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,701
Okay, this is officially the
cutest thing I've ever seen.

189
00:09:41,212 --> 00:09:44,306
Cubbies! I totally
forgot about cubbies.

190
00:09:44,882 --> 00:09:47,942
There's a finger-painting
station and a curly slide.

191
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,987
Am I too old to go here?

192
00:09:55,793 --> 00:09:56,851
Oh!

193
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,389
Adorable, right?

194
00:10:06,537 --> 00:10:08,664
I walked in on someone
in the bathroom. What?

195
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,230
I just walked in on
someone in the bathroom.

196
00:10:10,308 --> 00:10:11,332
Who?
I don't know.

197
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,036
The guy we're meeting with?
I don't know.

198
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:15,079
I don't know,
I don't know.

199
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:17,907
I am telling you, there
are no strawberries in here.

200
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:19,449
Well, I saw them in there.

201
00:10:19,517 --> 00:10:22,884
Well, maybe they ran away
'cause the pizza was, like,

202
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:25,789
"Hey, get out
of here, you stupid strawberries."

203
00:10:26,991 --> 00:10:28,856
I think when Andy
finally asks me out,

204
00:10:28,926 --> 00:10:31,759
he's gonna try to top what
he did with the drum line.

205
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,763
I can't wait to see
what he comes up with.

206
00:10:33,831 --> 00:10:36,197
The ball is totally
in Erin's court,

207
00:10:36,267 --> 00:10:38,064
after the whole
drum line thing.

208
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:42,067
First let me say, I told them
everything that you wanted me to say

209
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,199
in just the way you
wanted me to say it, so...

210
00:10:44,275 --> 00:10:46,334
<i>Gabe, honey, I love this, I
love the sound of your voice,</i>

211
00:10:46,411 --> 00:10:49,107
<i>but I really need
some new information now.</i>

212
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,081
Okay. I told the story
of your uncle,

213
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:54,209
and I have a feeling
that you would've really,

214
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,613
really been proud
of the way... Okay.

215
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,722
<i>Wait a minute, who is
it? Who's there? What?</i>

216
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:02,350
<i>Is there somebody
in the room with you?</i>

217
00:11:02,427 --> 00:11:05,294
<i>I want to see who it is.
Turn me around.</i>

218
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:07,024
I don't. It's just...

219
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:09,566
<i>Turn me around. Now.</i>

220
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,766
<i>Hey, buddy?
Was it something I said?</i>

221
00:11:13,838 --> 00:11:17,831
Hello. No. My name's
Michael Scott. Hello.

222
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:20,241
<i>Well, hello, Mr. Scott,
pleased to meet you.</i>

223
00:11:20,311 --> 00:11:24,372
Nice to meet you. We are very
excited about the merger with Sabre.

224
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:26,278
I think you have
a great accent.

225
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:30,150
<i>Thank you. I've been working
on it since I was a little girl.</i>

226
00:11:30,221 --> 00:11:33,452
<i>To what do I owe the pleasure
of this video chat?</i>

227
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:38,626
Well, I am a little concerned about
all these changes, to be quite frank.

228
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:42,793
I think we have done things a
certain way here at Dunder Mifflin

229
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:44,232
for quite some time.

230
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,231
<i>Pardon.
Pardon me, Mr. Scott,</i>

231
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:48,238
<i>but the last time
I saw a company</i>

232
00:11:48,306 --> 00:11:50,206
<i>as mismanaged
as Dunder Mifflin</i>

233
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:52,538
<i>was my grandson's
snowball company,</i>

234
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,908
<i>so you'll excuse me
if I'd prefer</i>

235
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:57,038
<i>that you all adapt to
the way we do things.</i>

236
00:11:57,715 --> 00:12:02,345
Okay. I feel very strongly
that you can't just come in here

237
00:12:02,753 --> 00:12:06,382
and change everything that
people have been doing forever.

238
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,030
Is Christian Slater back
there? Because he knows...

239
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,662
He'd know what to do.

240
00:12:16,701 --> 00:12:19,795
<i>So listen,
why don't you tell Gabe</i>

241
00:12:20,872 --> 00:12:24,205
<i>if by the end of the day
you can't handle the changes?</i>

242
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:27,836
I've already told him, but I will tell
him again, if you think that'll help.

243
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:31,211
<i>I would take until the end
of the day if I were you.</i>

244
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:59,237
Pam and Jim?
Hey. I'm Jerry.

245
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,368
Hi, Jerry.

246
00:13:00,444 --> 00:13:01,433
Jerry.

247
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:02,979
Good to see you.
Come on in.

248
00:13:03,214 --> 00:13:05,409
My office is
right back here.

249
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,474
This is the playroom.

250
00:13:07,552 --> 00:13:09,042
This is great.

251
00:13:09,353 --> 00:13:11,082
Gotta confess,
we came a little early,

252
00:13:11,155 --> 00:13:12,782
so we got a quick
look around, but...

253
00:13:12,857 --> 00:13:13,949
So you saw it already.

254
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:15,720
No. Yes, we saw this, yes.

255
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,658
No, it wasn't like
a look around,

256
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:19,525
we really just had a peek. Quick peek.

257
00:13:19,597 --> 00:13:21,360
Didn't focus on anything
in particular. It's lovely.

258
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,268
Gotta take this, sorry.
- Do it.

259
00:13:25,336 --> 00:13:26,360
Hi, this is Jerry.

260
00:13:26,437 --> 00:13:27,426
Okay, you've gotta
pull it together.

261
00:13:27,505 --> 00:13:28,972
We should just go.
He's really uncomfortable.

262
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,735
He's uncomfortable
because you're acting weird,

263
00:13:30,808 --> 00:13:31,900
so you have to
stop acting weird.

264
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:34,171
What if we just bring it up?
We'll just put it out in the open?

265
00:13:34,245 --> 00:13:36,907
That's the weirdest possible
solution to the problem.

266
00:13:36,981 --> 00:13:38,608
Sorry about that.
Right this way.

267
00:13:38,683 --> 00:13:39,980
All right.

268
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:47,919
I have come here today
to talk to Mr. David Wallace

269
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:51,293
about this whole thing
going on with Sabre.

270
00:13:51,362 --> 00:13:53,023
He will know
exactly what to do.

271
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:56,159
He is not a big fan of me
dropping by unannounced,

272
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,134
but then again, who is?

273
00:13:58,803 --> 00:14:00,168
Hey. Hi.
Michael!

274
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:03,207
Sorry, I hope you're
not busy doing something.

275
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:05,265
No, you kidding? Come on
in. Come on in. You sure?

276
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:06,970
You look great.
You look great, too.

277
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:08,136
You hungry?
I'm just having lunch.

278
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:10,009
Oh, yeah,
that sounds good.

279
00:14:10,081 --> 00:14:12,413
Teddy, look who
just stopped in.

280
00:14:13,084 --> 00:14:14,244
Hey.
- Hey.

281
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:17,845
Hey! Wow. That's very
loud. Keep it up, son!

282
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:23,619
Wow. Oh, yummy!

283
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:26,424
You have got the life, my friend. Yeah.

284
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:28,897
Can I just stay here
and never go back?

285
00:14:28,966 --> 00:14:30,866
Things not going
so well over there?

286
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:33,130
Oh, man!
How much time do you have?

287
00:14:33,204 --> 00:14:36,537
I have a doctor's appointment
next Thursday.

288
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:37,933
Yeah?

289
00:14:39,877 --> 00:14:43,574
Hey, honey, how's your day
going? Did you do anything cool?

290
00:14:44,682 --> 00:14:46,912
No, sweetie,
I just hung out.

291
00:14:47,852 --> 00:14:49,080
'Cause I saw
you had shoes on,

292
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,814
so I didn't know
if you did anything.

293
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:53,982
No, just hanging out, hon.
You remember Michael?

294
00:14:54,558 --> 00:14:56,685
Hi. Sorry, I was just
in the neighborhood

295
00:14:56,761 --> 00:14:59,161
and thought
I'd come by and say...

296
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,130
No problem at all.
This is great.

297
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:03,063
So, what are
you guys up to?

298
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:07,903
I don't know. Maybe...

299
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,202
Actually, you know, I think
maybe we'll go outside.

300
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:15,642
Maybe... We'll go outside? Go outside.

301
00:15:20,351 --> 00:15:22,285
There was one thing
we were curious about.

302
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,379
Your flexibility on things
like Easter or Memorial Day,

303
00:15:25,456 --> 00:15:27,754
because we might want to change
our days around a little bit.

304
00:15:27,825 --> 00:15:29,850
That seems a bit premature,
don't you think?

305
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:31,554
I don't even know if I
have a space for you yet,

306
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,995
and you're already lining up
your holiday plans.

307
00:15:34,065 --> 00:15:39,469
No, sorry, we're kind of planners,
but we're also flexible, too,

308
00:15:39,537 --> 00:15:40,526
so you know what?

309
00:15:40,604 --> 00:15:42,003
Maybe we can just discuss it
when the time comes.

310
00:15:42,073 --> 00:15:44,974
Yeah. If the time comes,
we can discuss it.

311
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:49,535
Is this because Jim walked in
on you going to the bathroom?

312
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,705
What?

313
00:15:53,751 --> 00:15:55,719
Seriously? You told her?

314
00:15:57,254 --> 00:15:58,721
Did it...
It might have come up

315
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:00,381
while we were
waiting for you.

316
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,323
And you thought that
might have something

317
00:16:02,393 --> 00:16:03,951
to do with how
the meeting is going?

318
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:05,655
No, I didn't... Maybe,
because it doesn't seem

319
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,664
to be going super well.

320
00:16:07,865 --> 00:16:10,095
You didn't consider the fact that
it might not be going super well

321
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:13,159
just because it might
not be going super well?

322
00:16:14,071 --> 00:16:16,130
No, 'cause we're
really nice people,

323
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:18,198
but you don't
seem to like us.

324
00:16:18,609 --> 00:16:20,804
I'm being
perfectly pleasant.

325
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,576
Did you ever consider
that you might not be

326
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,807
as charming as
you think you are?

327
00:16:24,882 --> 00:16:28,613
This coming from the guy who
still uses a children's toilet.

328
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:34,049
Why didn't you just
lock the door, man?

329
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,026
It doesn't lock for
the children's safety.

330
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,289
Anybody could have walked in.

331
00:16:40,931 --> 00:16:42,592
It was story time.

332
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:50,233
Sabre is changing everything. Site
blockers, they don't let us use cups.

333
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:52,335
So I started thinking,
who could handle this?

334
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:54,173
Who would know what to do?

335
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,304
David Wallace
would know what to do.

336
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,246
What should I do,
David Wallace?

337
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,943
I don't know.
What can you do?

338
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:03,885
Mmm! Exactly.
What are you thinking?

339
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:06,245
It's a tough one.

340
00:17:06,323 --> 00:17:07,551
It is a tough one.

341
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:08,922
I don't have
any ideas for you.

342
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,655
Yeah,
but one would be good.

343
00:17:12,696 --> 00:17:14,323
Hey, okay, wait.

344
00:17:14,398 --> 00:17:15,422
Okay.

345
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,626
I want to tell you about
a business idea I have.

346
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:18,725
Okay.
Okay.

347
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,897
You know how kids leave
their toys everywhere? Right?

348
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:25,271
So this is a vacuum. It's
like a Shop-Vac type of thing.

349
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:30,046
Teaches kids how to pick up
their own toys. Right?

350
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,739
Baseball gloves,
Hacky Sacks,

351
00:17:32,817 --> 00:17:36,218
drumsticks...
Picks it up.

352
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,716
So the kid's making
the noise to pick it up?

353
00:17:37,788 --> 00:17:39,312
Yeah. No.

354
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,358
No, no,
that's the vacuum noise.

355
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:42,483
Okay.

356
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,221
You don't like it.

357
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,319
No, I think it's...

358
00:17:45,396 --> 00:17:46,658
No, it's okay.

359
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:48,698
Another guy from Dunder
Mifflin, Arnie from Research,

360
00:17:48,766 --> 00:17:52,202
he's gonna draw up
the prototype, and...

361
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:56,134
It's like a Shop-Vac.
Did I say that?

362
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:57,333
Yep.

363
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:00,967
It'll be okay.

364
00:18:04,081 --> 00:18:05,514
Hey, any fun
weekend plans?

365
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,073
No. You?

366
00:18:08,152 --> 00:18:09,619
No, actually.

367
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:14,248
So, nothing?

368
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,885
No movies or parties

369
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,952
or anything you might
want to invite someone to?

370
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,798
Nothing. It's wide open.

371
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,792
Okay.

372
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,698
That's as hard
as I can hint.

373
00:18:27,705 --> 00:18:30,799
Hey, you know, if you want, I'm
sure I could get Arnie onboard,

374
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:33,366
if you want to join us
for Suck lt.

375
00:18:34,345 --> 00:18:35,471
Work together again.

376
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:36,638
The what?

377
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:38,678
"Suck lt."
That's what it's called.

378
00:18:38,749 --> 00:18:39,977
Oh! Okay.

379
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,244
Huh? Catchy.

380
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,876
Kid's will love it.
I like it.

381
00:18:42,953 --> 00:18:44,250
There are very few things
that would make me

382
00:18:44,321 --> 00:18:46,482
not want to team up
with David Wallace,

383
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:48,650
and Suck It
is one of them.

384
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:51,988
See you later.
Oh, Michael.

385
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,086
I know.

386
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,187
Thank you for coming.

387
00:18:54,265 --> 00:18:55,823
Thanks for having me.

388
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,165
Well, that's not the David
Wallace that I remember.

389
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:04,639
That was some sort
of weird creature

390
00:19:05,576 --> 00:19:08,101
that lives in
David Wallace's house.

391
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:13,950
Oh, my God. All right!
Just get me out of here.

392
00:19:18,522 --> 00:19:21,150
Hello! Is anybody home?

393
00:19:22,893 --> 00:19:24,485
Thank you, Erin.

394
00:19:24,695 --> 00:19:29,428
Now, if everyone would
please ready their canteens

395
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,127
so I can fill them

396
00:19:31,201 --> 00:19:34,261
with the sweet, sweet
nectar of Gabe's homeland

397
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:37,273
and then propose a toast.
Here we go.

398
00:19:37,441 --> 00:19:39,272
You know when people
say getting fired

399
00:19:39,343 --> 00:19:40,935
was the best thing that
ever happened to them?

400
00:19:41,011 --> 00:19:42,535
I feel sorry
for those people.

401
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:44,979
That?
The best thing? Really?

402
00:19:46,684 --> 00:19:50,142
Well, I'm not really one
for making speeches.

403
00:19:50,821 --> 00:19:51,879
Yes, you are.
Since when?

404
00:19:51,956 --> 00:19:53,014
You make a lot.

405
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,216
But I feel
pretty good right now.

406
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:57,852
I really do. A lot better than
I did earlier, let me tell you.

407
00:19:57,928 --> 00:19:59,088
That's your toast?

408
00:19:59,163 --> 00:20:00,721
No, this is my toast.

409
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:04,863
I think this whole thing
with Sabre is gonna work out.

410
00:20:04,935 --> 00:20:07,301
I have a very good
feeling about it.

411
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:09,805
Michael, this isn't a toast,
you're just thinking out loud.

412
00:20:09,873 --> 00:20:11,465
Here's my toast.

413
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,975
Orange juice is in here,

414
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:20,479
and like Sabre, it is from
Florida, and it is good.

415
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,743
Just 'cause you have liquid,
that doesn't make it a toast.

416
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,847
Here's the toast.
I'm gonna do it now.

417
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:33,160
Raise your container
to us and to Sabre.

418
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:36,630
To us and to Sabre. Hear, hear.

419
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,962
Mmm.

420
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:42,472
Wow, that is metallicy.
That's like drinking a battery.

421
00:20:45,776 --> 00:20:49,906
Really gets you in the fillings,
doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.

422
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:00,118
<i>Well, it's a mess,
what a mess</i>

423
00:21:00,991 --> 00:21:02,618
<i>What you gonna do</i>

424
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:07,027
<i>You're gonna take out your Suck
It And you'll suck it, suck it</i>

425
00:21:07,598 --> 00:21:10,123
<i>Take out your Suck It
and you'll suck it</i>

426
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,394
<i>Suck it
Yeah</i>

427
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:12,662
<i>Suck it
Yeah</i>

428
00:21:12,736 --> 00:21:13,998
<i>Suck it
Yeah</i>

429
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,834
<i>Take out my Suck It and we'll Suck it</i>

430
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:17,339
<i>Yeah
Suck it</i>

431
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:19,876
<i>Yeah. Take out my Suck It and
we'll suck it Take out, suck it</i>

432
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:21,069
<i>Yeah</i>

433
00:21:28,819 --> 00:21:30,116
Teddy!
Dad!
