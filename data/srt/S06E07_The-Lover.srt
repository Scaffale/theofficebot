1
00:00:05,203 --> 00:00:06,295
They're back!

2
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:09,135
Oh, yeah!

3
00:00:09,207 --> 00:00:11,607
Woo-hoo!
- Jim and Pam!

4
00:00:11,676 --> 00:00:13,974
How was Puerto Rico? Was
it so romantic? JIM: It was.

5
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:15,034
It really was.

6
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:16,205
Really was.

7
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:18,112
I'm so happy for you.

8
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:19,411
Puerto Rico
was awesome.

9
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:21,509
Oh, my gosh. The honeymoon was great.

10
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:23,986
We met this other couple at
the resort, Frank and Benny.

11
00:00:24,055 --> 00:00:25,545
We hung out
with them a lot.

12
00:00:25,624 --> 00:00:29,116
Frank and
Beans. Always makes her laugh.

13
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:31,996
Frank and Beans.

14
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:35,722
Is there someone there?
Who's there?

15
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,325
I hear voices.
Is somebody there?

16
00:00:37,402 --> 00:00:38,494
Yeah!

17
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,530
Is someone here? I can't
see you because I'm blind.

18
00:00:43,608 --> 00:00:44,870
It's Jim
and Pam, Michael.

19
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,433
- It is?
- Yeah.

20
00:00:46,511 --> 00:00:47,842
They're back?

21
00:00:50,849 --> 00:00:52,407
Pam.
Nope.

22
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:55,180
And, oh, Jim.

23
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:56,584
Hi, Michael.

24
00:00:56,655 --> 00:01:01,490
I haven't seen you since my
accident that I had when I fell...

25
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:05,925
I fell into the pool
of acid, eyes-first.

26
00:01:07,432 --> 00:01:08,490
Blind guy.

27
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,269
Blind Guy McSqueezy.
How do I describe it?

28
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:14,430
It is a character
I've been workshopping,

29
00:01:14,506 --> 00:01:18,033
whose lack of vision gets
him into all sorts of trouble.

30
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,907
The women in my improv
class absolutely hate him.

31
00:01:25,684 --> 00:01:27,208
So, what'd you
bring us?

32
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:28,547
Some candy.

33
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,678
What else?

34
00:01:29,754 --> 00:01:30,743
That's it.

35
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:33,586
Oh, because you spent
so much on the wedding.

36
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:38,522
It's good to be home.

37
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,815
This conversation has
two items on the agenda.

38
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,116
Did we have a conversation scheduled?

39
00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:07,158
Number one, do not leave
your things on my desk.

40
00:02:07,225 --> 00:02:09,921
It's not some kind of personal
pen receptacle for you.

41
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:11,690
I don't care how high
they promote you.

42
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:14,493
Which brings me
to item number two.

43
00:02:14,566 --> 00:02:16,898
I never formally congratulated
you on your promotion,

44
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:21,268
so I'd just like to
say congratulations.

45
00:02:22,274 --> 00:02:26,438
Wow. That's really thoughtful
of you, Dwight. Thank you.

46
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:27,535
You're welcome.

47
00:02:29,014 --> 00:02:31,642
I inserted a listening device
into the belly of the mallard.

48
00:02:32,117 --> 00:02:35,985
<i>Now I can observe Jim,
track Jim, and destroy Jim.</i>

49
00:02:36,054 --> 00:02:37,783
<i>Just like in
the Bavarian fairytale.</i>

50
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,190
<i>Only this time the mallard
skins the toad alive.</i>

51
00:02:43,628 --> 00:02:44,617
And, of course,
in this version,

52
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,358
you lose the whole veiled
critique of the Kaiser thing.

53
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:51,391
I'm sorry to have been
bugging you all these years.

54
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:53,995
It's a real
handsome duck.

55
00:02:54,072 --> 00:02:55,096
Mallard.

56
00:02:55,173 --> 00:02:57,232
Okay, I'll get out
of your hair.

57
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,840
Hey.
Hey.

58
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,816
We brought back some
Puerto Rican candy.

59
00:03:06,885 --> 00:03:08,978
Coco-Leche. That's
my favorite. Awesome.

60
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:10,783
I'll leave it up here
so everyone can enjoy it.

61
00:03:10,855 --> 00:03:14,120
Oh, let me just check
with Michael first.

62
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:16,285
I think it'll be okay.

63
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,159
I think it will, too, but I'll
just check with him, though.

64
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,219
Great.

65
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,823
Oops. Sorry. Oops!

66
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,801
I have recently
taken a lover.

67
00:03:33,878 --> 00:03:36,472
Well, that's great.
Congratulations.

68
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:38,344
Who's the lucky lady?

69
00:03:38,416 --> 00:03:39,644
Pam's mom.

70
00:03:41,186 --> 00:03:43,654
What?
Pam's mom, Helene.

71
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:44,950
Remember,
from your wedding?

72
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,458
You're messing with me.
About what?

73
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:49,254
You did not have
sex with Pam's mom.

74
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:50,351
Oh, big time.

75
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:51,417
What kind of car
does she drive?

76
00:03:51,496 --> 00:03:53,054
She drives a green Camry,

77
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,895
And the seats go
all the way down.

78
00:03:55,967 --> 00:03:56,956
All the way down.

79
00:03:57,035 --> 00:03:58,297
Oh, my God.

80
00:03:59,437 --> 00:04:00,426
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,132
What?

82
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:04,767
Okay, never tell Pam,
and then, secondly...

83
00:04:04,843 --> 00:04:07,334
Good. A pact. A pact.

84
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,606
Although, I may have
to break it tonight,

85
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,581
when Helene and I
tell Pam over dinner.

86
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,708
You all right?

87
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:13,808
Oh, my God.

88
00:04:13,885 --> 00:04:15,910
Hey, Jim... Not now, Toby. My God!

89
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:17,921
Jesus. Get the hell out of here, idiot!

90
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:19,047
What did I do?

91
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:21,649
Okay, as far as dinner
tonight, cancel that,

92
00:04:21,726 --> 00:04:23,717
and please,
for both of our sakes,

93
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:27,595
never, ever,
ever see her again.

94
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:29,566
I think you're
underestimating Pam.

95
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,068
I think more than anything,
she wants me to be happy.

96
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,037
No. Not more
than anything.

97
00:04:34,105 --> 00:04:35,367
Okay. I...

98
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,431
I have a good thing with the
mom. Don't call her "the mom."

99
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,840
She's right on my way
home from work.

100
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,275
Then take a different
way home, man!

101
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:43,678
All right,
I'll take surface streets.

102
00:04:44,115 --> 00:04:46,640
The last thing in the world I
would want to do is upset Pam.

103
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,208
Okay. So, we're good.

104
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:49,378
Yeah.

105
00:04:53,692 --> 00:04:56,252
Can you change my dinner
reservations from four people to two?

106
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,591
Sure. Is it okay
if I put out some candy

107
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,187
that Pam brought back
from Puerto Rico?

108
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:02,256
Sure.
Thanks for asking.

109
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:03,891
Pam, we're all set.

110
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,834
Yum.

111
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,200
Frank and Beans!

112
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,837
Frank and Beans!

113
00:05:16,948 --> 00:05:19,246
So, what'd we decide
for Michael?

114
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:22,115
The bottle of rum or
the seashell alarm clock?

115
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:25,122
You know what, can I have
the weekend to decide?

116
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,953
Bottle of rum it is.

117
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,152
All right, shall we?
You know what?

118
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:33,026
I am really slammed trying to
catch up on everything here,

119
00:05:33,098 --> 00:05:35,157
and I know that
Michael's slammed, too,

120
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:39,169
so maybe we should do this when
things are a little less crazy.

121
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,474
Come on, it'll take two seconds.

122
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:45,975
No, it...

123
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,657
Oh, wow.

124
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:14,270
That is amazing. I feel
like a real Puerto Rican.

125
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,670
Michael, you're all
set at Botticelli's.

126
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,230
I changed the reservation
to two people.

127
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:18,673
Erin, look.

128
00:06:19,043 --> 00:06:20,408
Fun.
- Yeah.

129
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,580
Wow, Botticelli's. That
sounds like a special occasion.

130
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:26,480
Yeah, no,
it's nobody.

131
00:06:27,652 --> 00:06:30,212
I don't know. I think
Michael has a date.

132
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:31,949
No. Yeah, I think you have a date.

133
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:33,684
I don't, I don't.
Come on.

134
00:06:33,758 --> 00:06:35,350
Ah, I think we should just drop it.

135
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:37,986
Because obviously he doesn't
want to talk about it.

136
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,825
I don't deserve this, guys.
- Yes, you do.

137
00:06:39,898 --> 00:06:42,230
No, I don't.
Just take the parrot.

138
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,859
Okay, back to
the old grind.

139
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,837
I was probably going to
break up with her anyway.

140
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,601
Oh! That's too bad.
Don't.

141
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:51,369
Pam, it is very
complicated.

142
00:06:51,442 --> 00:06:52,636
There are a lot of
moving parts here.

143
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,870
Sounds complicated.

144
00:06:53,945 --> 00:06:56,106
Yeah, but, I mean, if you
really like this person,

145
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:57,876
then you should
see where it goes.

146
00:06:57,949 --> 00:06:59,007
You want me
to be happy?

147
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:00,710
Of course.

148
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:05,154
Part of the problem is she's the
mother of a close friend of mine.

149
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,681
Oh.

150
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:09,192
More than a friend.
A coworker.

151
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:12,260
Oh, gossip.
Who is it?

152
00:07:14,933 --> 00:07:16,332
Who is it?

153
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:19,999
Who is it,
Michael?

154
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,307
Who?

155
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:25,433
It's okay.

156
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,037
No, no, no, no, no.

157
00:07:29,414 --> 00:07:33,612
No. Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

158
00:07:33,685 --> 00:07:36,279
No!

159
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,814
That could have
gone one of two ways,

160
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,381
but I never expected her to get upset.

161
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:51,829
You seem tense. Hey, you want
me to give you the chills?

162
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:54,731
Okay.

163
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:04,247
<i>There's an egg on your
head And the yolk is running down</i>

164
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:05,407
<i>The yolk is running down</i>

165
00:08:05,483 --> 00:08:06,541
Feels good.

166
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:09,951
<i>There's a knife in your back
And the blood is gushing down</i>

167
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,819
Sleeping with Pam's mom.
Sometimes dinner.

168
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,958
<i>The blood is gushing down
The blood is gushing down</i>

169
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,391
You know, I really would
have appreciated a heads-up

170
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:22,797
that you were
into dating mothers.

171
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:25,165
I would have introduced you to mine.

172
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:28,467
How could you do this
to me? He's my boss.

173
00:08:29,107 --> 00:08:32,304
How many times have I
complained about him to you?

174
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:35,841
No, I am not being dramatic,
you are being crazy!

175
00:08:38,316 --> 00:08:40,944
Who wants a hot chocolate?

176
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:42,452
Thank you.

177
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,986
So, Dwight gave me this
wooden mallard as a gift.

178
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,529
I found a recording
device in it.

179
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:57,457
Yes. So, I think
if I play it just right,

180
00:08:58,002 --> 00:09:01,563
<i>I can get Dwight to live out
the plot of National Treasure.</i>

181
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:05,700
You need to be more upset about
this. She's your mother, too, now.

182
00:09:07,578 --> 00:09:10,513
Your mother is sleeping
with Michael Scott.

183
00:09:13,885 --> 00:09:15,819
Andy, can I talk
to you for a second?

184
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:17,718
Sure thing,
Tuna boss.

185
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,299
<i>How may I be
of service to you?</i>

186
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:34,400
I am going to need
your advice.

187
00:09:47,485 --> 00:09:49,817
I was thinking of getting this
opera for Dwight's birthday.

188
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,582
What do you think?

189
00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:56,893
This aria is a joke.
Really?

190
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,223
What are you thinking?

191
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,191
I was going to go
with this one.

192
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,064
Let me tell you something,
if you respect him at all,

193
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:07,604
you will get him
something better.

194
00:10:11,843 --> 00:10:13,504
Nard-Dog, what was
that all about?

195
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:14,840
I know, right?

196
00:10:14,912 --> 00:10:16,379
What were you guys
talking about in there?

197
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:18,915
Trust me, it would
only make you mad.

198
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,663
Due to a certain
recent incident,

199
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:36,427
corporate has asked all the
branches to come up with ideas

200
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:40,995
as to how we can better
communicate with our communities.

201
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:44,564
<i>Is this because of the 60 Minutes
segment about working conditions</i>

202
00:10:44,642 --> 00:10:45,700
in our Peruvian
paper mill?

203
00:10:45,777 --> 00:10:47,335
That was a hit job.

204
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:50,939
If you read the Dunder Mifflin
press release, it clearly states

205
00:10:51,015 --> 00:10:53,483
that they had absolutely
nothing to do

206
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:55,610
with that particular
cancer cluster.

207
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,518
So, if there is a lesson
to be learned here,

208
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,284
and I'm not sure
that there is,

209
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,054
it is that in order to
help our communities,

210
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:05,925
we need to put other people's
needs ahead of our own.

211
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:10,295
And whoever comes up with the best
idea gets a $50 gift certificate

212
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:12,268
to the restaurant of his or
her choice.

213
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,167
Yeah.
- Good, good.

214
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:18,106
Okay, who wants to help the
world one step at a time?

215
00:11:18,643 --> 00:11:19,701
All right, good.

216
00:11:19,777 --> 00:11:20,801
Volunteerism is important.

217
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,107
Every weekend I volunteer
at the local animal shelter,

218
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,149
and they need a lot
of help down there.

219
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,946
Last Sunday, I had to put down
over 150 pets all by myself.

220
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,145
All right,
that's...

221
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,688
Paint a mural of Chicano
leaders. All right.

222
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:34,919
I have a way to make Scranton a
better place. You could leave it.

223
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:38,389
Okay, I'm out of here.
See you later, guys.

224
00:11:38,463 --> 00:11:39,953
And stay out.
Bye-bye.

225
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:43,461
Okay. Oh, no, here's
an idea. Conservation.

226
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,434
I love it,
conservation.

227
00:11:45,503 --> 00:11:48,063
Let's start by
conserving our time

228
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:50,266
and stop having
these stupid meetings.

229
00:11:51,242 --> 00:11:54,507
No more meetings!
No more meetings!

230
00:11:54,579 --> 00:11:57,776
No more meetings!
No more meetings!

231
00:11:59,717 --> 00:12:01,309
Anybody else?
Who else has an idea?

232
00:12:01,385 --> 00:12:03,376
I have some ideas about
conservation. JIM: Yes.

233
00:12:03,454 --> 00:12:04,614
Angela.
Thank you.

234
00:12:05,756 --> 00:12:07,553
Please. Can you hold down the fort?

235
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,957
Hey, boo. ANGELA: Well, first
of all, I think that we could...

236
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:11,016
Why are you crying?

237
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:12,653
Yes, I think we should
look into that.

238
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,789
If you could just
speak up louder.

239
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:16,094
Well, for our profit and
loss... MICHAEL: No, no.

240
00:12:17,301 --> 00:12:21,829
No, I'll talk to her. I will. No,
nobody talks to my baby that way. Uh-uh.

241
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:26,041
Yeah, I'll let you know how it
goes. All right. Bye, pickle.

242
00:12:26,878 --> 00:12:29,005
- Who's pickle?
- Who's pickle?

243
00:12:29,514 --> 00:12:31,141
Pamela Morgan Beesly.

244
00:12:31,215 --> 00:12:33,809
You need to apologize
to your mother right now.

245
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,319
I'm sorry, I was told
I had the floor. Yes.

246
00:12:36,387 --> 00:12:37,684
Hold on, hold on.
What's going on?

247
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:38,813
Nothing.

248
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,324
Nothing at all.
It's all good.

249
00:12:41,392 --> 00:12:46,091
I'm not apologizing to anyone.
Michael owes me an apology.

250
00:12:46,164 --> 00:12:48,029
For trying to find happiness
in the arms of a lover?

251
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,794
Don't call my mother
your lover.

252
00:12:50,935 --> 00:12:52,368
Oh, yes! That's what
I'm talking about.

253
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:54,063
That is not okay, dude.

254
00:12:54,138 --> 00:12:55,366
All right,
in my defense...

255
00:12:55,439 --> 00:12:57,236
Disgusting.
That's messed up, man.

256
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,708
Yes, thank you.
Welcome to my personal hell.

257
00:12:59,777 --> 00:13:02,041
You have no sense of boundaries,
Michael. Shut up, Oscar.

258
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:04,445
Hey, all right, you know what?
Clearly, I'm outnumbered here.

259
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,882
But can I just say
one thing? Please?

260
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,812
What is so wrong
about me?

261
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,085
I'm caring,
I'm generous.

262
00:13:16,227 --> 00:13:17,660
I'm sensual.

263
00:13:18,396 --> 00:13:24,824
Is it really so horrible that I could
possibly go out and find happiness?

264
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,203
Good luck, Michael. I hope
you find what you're looking for.

265
00:13:33,277 --> 00:13:34,471
Maybe you're right.
Who are we to...

266
00:13:34,545 --> 00:13:35,637
Shut up, Oscar!

267
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:37,146
What is wrong
with all of you?

268
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,649
He is sleeping
with my mother!

269
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:41,981
I don't think there's a whole
lot of sleeping going on.

270
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:44,351
Let's get back to
the matter at hand.

271
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,787
Whatever, you know.

272
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:47,847
Sleep with my mom, just
sleep with everybody's mom.

273
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:48,914
No, no, no,
no, no... No.

274
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:50,927
This is not... RYAN: Whoa! That's
my mom you're talking about.

275
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:52,292
I don't like
the tone here.

276
00:13:52,363 --> 00:13:54,888
This is a place of business.
You are to listen to others,

277
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:56,399
you are to give
others respect,

278
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,560
and you are to keep your
personal issues out of it.

279
00:13:58,636 --> 00:14:01,002
Oh, my God!
You are ridiculous!

280
00:14:01,072 --> 00:14:03,336
Do not talk
to me that way!

281
00:14:03,407 --> 00:14:06,968
I am your boss and I may someday
be your father, so get out.

282
00:14:07,044 --> 00:14:10,172
You are never going to
be my father. You get out.

283
00:14:10,248 --> 00:14:14,184
I hope that you are willing to
die in this office, because I am.

284
00:14:14,652 --> 00:14:15,914
Me, too.

285
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,084
Hey.
Hey.

286
00:14:21,292 --> 00:14:23,692
Pam, how's your day going?

287
00:14:23,761 --> 00:14:26,787
Pam, just for the record, I think
you're overreacting a little bit.

288
00:14:26,864 --> 00:14:28,855
Your mom's old enough
to make her own decisions.

289
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,128
Oh, well, thanks, Oscar.

290
00:14:31,202 --> 00:14:32,567
I was just wondering,
how would you feel

291
00:14:32,637 --> 00:14:34,366
if Michael was sleeping
with your mom?

292
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,565
My mother's
in a wheelchair.

293
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:38,974
Well, he could still...

294
00:14:40,911 --> 00:14:42,742
I'm sorry about that.

295
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:46,947
Could I just get you to sign
the second page as well?

296
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,612
<i>Ryan, I have
to ask you a personal question.</i>

297
00:14:49,687 --> 00:14:51,450
<i>Do you think that
I should get a fedora?</i>

298
00:14:51,522 --> 00:14:53,490
<i>I don't think so, no.</i>

299
00:14:53,924 --> 00:14:55,221
<i>Why? I think I'd
look really hot in one.</i>

300
00:14:55,293 --> 00:14:56,521
<i>Where did you
get your fedora?</i>

301
00:14:56,594 --> 00:14:57,788
<i>I'd rather
not say.</i>

302
00:14:57,862 --> 00:15:00,194
<i>You think I'm going
to get the same fedora as you?</i>

303
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,424
Hey, Dwight.
Shh!

304
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:03,660
Natural look. KELLY: I think
I would look really cute in it.

305
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:05,258
It has to go with the
persona that you already have.

306
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:06,564
Well, I think
I have that persona.

307
00:15:06,637 --> 00:15:07,797
Where did you
get that mallard?

308
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:08,861
What the hell
is a mallard?

309
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,270
That!

310
00:15:10,808 --> 00:15:13,800
Oh, Professor Damon D. Duck.
Jim gave him to me.

311
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:16,346
Okay, I gave that to him as
a gift. I'm taking that back.

312
00:15:16,414 --> 00:15:18,177
If you take it back,
I'll scream.

313
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:21,710
I'll give you
five bucks for it.

314
00:15:21,786 --> 00:15:23,117
Twenty.

315
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,552
Ten.
Deal.

316
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:30,493
You're so cool.

317
00:15:30,561 --> 00:15:33,689
This reminds me, you owe
me three bucks for gas.

318
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:36,296
Hey, Toby, can I talk
to you for a minute?

319
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:37,391
Yeah, sure.

320
00:15:37,468 --> 00:15:39,333
What's up?
I just wanted to apologize

321
00:15:39,403 --> 00:15:41,337
for taking that tone
with you earlier.

322
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,600
That was uncalled for.
I'm sorry.

323
00:15:43,674 --> 00:15:47,405
Yeah. That means a lot.
Thank you for saying it.

324
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:48,467
Can I sit down
for a second?

325
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:49,535
Yeah,
or pull up a chair,

326
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:50,910
or you can sit
on the shredder.

327
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:57,180
This is going
to sound weird,

328
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:01,191
but I think I may be the victim
of a hostile work environment

329
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,055
with this whole
Pam situation.

330
00:16:03,127 --> 00:16:05,857
You should probably deal with
that outside of the workplace.

331
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,488
She brought it
into the workplace,

332
00:16:07,565 --> 00:16:09,863
so I feel like it has
to be dealt with here.

333
00:16:09,934 --> 00:16:12,903
Yeah. Okay, well, I
mean, I could talk to her.

334
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:13,959
Really?
Yeah.

335
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:15,767
Would you do that?
Yeah.

336
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,104
That's why they
pay me the big bucks.

337
00:16:22,646 --> 00:16:24,614
You're a good, good guy.

338
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,507
Okay.

339
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:29,519
You know, I always knew if Michael
just took the time to get to know me,

340
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:31,077
we'd become friends.

341
00:16:32,423 --> 00:16:35,358
Hey, Pam, could I talk
to you for a sec?

342
00:16:36,861 --> 00:16:38,829
Sure. What's up?

343
00:16:38,896 --> 00:16:42,832
Well, I was hoping that maybe in light
of everything that's happened today,

344
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,494
it would be a good idea
if you and me and Michael

345
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:48,436
head into the conference room
for some conflict resolution.

346
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:49,973
What's the matter? Can't
fight your own battles?

347
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,600
No, that's...

348
00:16:52,676 --> 00:16:54,906
Maybe you should just take the
rest of the day off, you know?

349
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,844
Oh, would that make
you feel better?

350
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:59,542
I don't... I can't hear
your conversation.

351
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,518
You can tell Michael
that I'm not leaving.

352
00:17:07,725 --> 00:17:09,488
Buddy, I think that you
can't make her leave...

353
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,084
Yeah, yeah, okay,
you're a jackass.

354
00:17:11,162 --> 00:17:14,791
Hey, hey, you know what? You're
just as stubborn as your mother.

355
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,492
When you don't want to do
something, you just don't do it.

356
00:17:17,635 --> 00:17:19,466
Michael, you're just her rebound!

357
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:21,368
You were right, Jim, I
should have listened to you.

358
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,373
Should never
have told her.

359
00:17:23,441 --> 00:17:25,170
What? You knew?

360
00:17:26,744 --> 00:17:30,305
Barely. I... I don't have all the facts.

361
00:17:31,682 --> 00:17:33,547
Frank and Beans.

362
00:17:36,387 --> 00:17:39,185
Okay, do you want me
to stop dating your mom?

363
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:41,690
Is that how we're going to
get past this? Because I will.

364
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,125
Hmm. Yes.

365
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:45,594
Well, that is not
going to happen.

366
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:46,960
Then why did you
even offer?

367
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,898
Because I assumed that
you want me to be happy,

368
00:17:49,967 --> 00:17:52,492
because I want
you to be happy.

369
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,300
Michael, let me make
this very easy for you.

370
00:17:55,372 --> 00:17:59,365
I could give a About your
happiness. Stop dating my mother!

371
00:18:01,045 --> 00:18:03,240
You know what? I'm going to
start dating her even harder.

372
00:18:03,314 --> 00:18:04,474
What's that
supposed to mean?

373
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:05,981
You know what it means.

374
00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:12,947
Hey.
Shut it.

375
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,183
Yep.

376
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,623
I don't need to be
friends with Pam.

377
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:19,492
I have plenty of
female friends.

378
00:18:19,563 --> 00:18:25,729
My mom, Pam's mom, my aunt,
although she just blocked me on IM.

379
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:30,366
What's-her-face from Quiznos.
I see her four times a week.

380
00:18:36,413 --> 00:18:38,472
Dwight, you brought
the mallard back.

381
00:18:38,549 --> 00:18:41,450
Well, I had to.
I mean, Kelly was not...

382
00:18:41,752 --> 00:18:43,117
<i>Hi, buddy.</i>

383
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,167
I'm sorry.
A wooden duck?

384
00:18:58,235 --> 00:19:03,605
Mallard. I put it in your
office in order to surveil you.

385
00:19:05,276 --> 00:19:07,437
I was jealous that you
got the promotion over me.

386
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:10,275
Okay, just to be clear,
you're terrible at this.

387
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:12,212
And you're not equipped for
espionage. I'm equipped...

388
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:13,545
Stop.

389
00:19:14,685 --> 00:19:15,674
Don't tell Michael.

390
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:16,845
I won't.

391
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:19,412
But you will wash
and buff our car.

392
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,550
Punishment fits the crime. I accept.

393
00:19:23,727 --> 00:19:27,288
Good night, everyone.
Night, Pam.

394
00:19:28,065 --> 00:19:30,192
Thanks again
for the rum.

395
00:19:31,502 --> 00:19:34,232
Good night, Michael.
Good night, Erin.

396
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,102
Hey, Pam, can I see you for a second?

397
00:19:42,947 --> 00:19:46,212
So, Dwight heard you were
having a really rough day,

398
00:19:46,283 --> 00:19:49,081
so he generously
offered to wash our car.

399
00:19:50,654 --> 00:19:52,144
Aw, he did that for me?

400
00:19:52,222 --> 00:19:54,087
Yes, he did.

401
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,857
You know what was nice?

402
00:19:57,928 --> 00:19:59,953
Night swimming in Biobay.

403
00:20:00,564 --> 00:20:03,192
<i>Remember that older couple whose
kids were also named Jim and Pam?</i>

404
00:20:03,267 --> 00:20:04,427
<i>Yeah.</i>

405
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:08,669
<i>Say more nice things.</i>

406
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:12,641
Well, we went on a Segway
tour, and we're awesome at it.

407
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,177
Yes, we are.

408
00:20:14,244 --> 00:20:16,576
And Frank and Beans.

409
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:21,075
Maybe I'm overreacting.

410
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:22,948
Yeah, maybe.

411
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:25,212
But I don't think I am.

412
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,189
You're not, nope.

413
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:29,451
Nope.

414
00:20:32,696 --> 00:20:35,028
Oh! Where did you get that hat?

415
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:36,293
I'd rather not say.

416
00:21:00,024 --> 00:21:02,788
<i>We have our high
quality 28-pound bond,</i>

417
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,388
<i>our heavier 38-pound bond, or our...</i>

418
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:10,325
I've got eight
hours of this.

419
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:16,329
Of course I wanted Jim to find
the mallard. Make him feel safe.

420
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,774
Did you really think I would
put my primary listening device

421
00:21:19,843 --> 00:21:21,310
in a wooden mallard?

422
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:24,037
I'm not insane.

423
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,146
<i>Fifty-five pound cover
stock, which is the heaviest paper</i>

424
00:21:28,218 --> 00:21:30,413
<i>that will still feed smoothly
through your desktop printer.</i>
