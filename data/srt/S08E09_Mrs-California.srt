1
00:00:03,378 --> 00:00:04,920
Oops. A little help

2
00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,009
Wow, your hair
is really thinning

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:14,013
Standing is proven to be
healthier, increases productivity

4
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:15,389
and just looks cooler

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,267
Picture someone
doing something heroic

6
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,602
Now, was he sitting
or standing?

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:22,771
Not counting FDR

8
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,524
Every second you sit there
is an hour off your life

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,443
Look at all of you

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:29,570
I feel like you're
in a suicide cult

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:32,364
No, no, no. You're
way off on that one.

12
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:34,491
Are you really
comfortable standing there?

13
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,703
I tried one of those, and I just
couldn't find the sweet spot

14
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:44,668
Hey, guys, let's just all admit it, okay?
Dwight's better than us

15
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:47,087
He had the guts
to stop sitting,

16
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:49,882
and he's never, ever gonna
go back on it, right?

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,425
That's right, Jim

18
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,811
Hey, man
Hey

19
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,938
Taking a
load off, huh?

20
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,607
No. Putting a
load on, more like

21
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,983
Good luck with that

22
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,443
Last thing I need is luck

23
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,034
Thank you so much

24
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:35,719
What are you up to?
Oh, look out

25
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:36,887
Just... What are you doing?

26
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,097
Think fast. Ha ha

27
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:40,182
Give that back Come on. Prank

28
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,601
That's real creative

29
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,852
You know what you're
right It's not my best

30
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,145
'Cause you could
easily just bend over

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,271
and pick that up
right?

32
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,232
I could. I just don't
feel like it, loser

33
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,441
Because you're sitting?
Standing

34
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:51,026
Okay.
Don't

35
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,694
Because you're sitting?
Standing

36
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,363
You know
I have to do this

37
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,490
I know

38
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,574
Whoa

39
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:23,892
Andrew Baines Bernard

40
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,811
I think you could
just do Andy Bernard

41
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,313
Andrew Baines Bernard
I love filling

42
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,899
these out 'cause it's like
Oh, I'm taking a test

43
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,526
but I know the answers

44
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:37,281
In four seconds, my wife is going
to be coming through that door

45
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,490
I told her she
could work here

46
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,326
Under no circumstances
can that be allowed to happen

47
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,955
There you are, honey

48
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,124
How on earth did
you miss the elevator?

49
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,167
What was that?

50
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,668
I don't know.
He wasn't talking to me

51
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,254
But if I were you,
I wouldn't hire his wife

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,174
That's why my foundation

53
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:56,383
the Dream For
A Wish Foundation

54
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,634
is gonna put them
out of business.

55
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,053
They're not gonna
know what hit them

56
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,265
Everyone, I'd like
to introduce my wife

57
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:04,850
Mrs. Robert California

58
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,144
Mrs. California
this is everyone

59
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:08,270
Hello.
Hi

60
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:10,355
Welcome.
Call me Susan, please

61
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,859
Last night at dinner,
Susan and I were talking

62
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,485
about her returning
to work.

63
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,198
So she's here today
to see if there's a good fit

64
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,658
Something tells me it
just might work out

65
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:25,871
This is Andy Bernard,
the regional manager

66
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,039
Hello. Nice to meet you

67
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,207
Hey there.
It's a pleasure. Welcome

68
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,291
Thank you

69
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,918
Andy, would you
be so kind

70
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,711
as to show Susan
around the office,

71
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,796
introduce her to
various departments

72
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,132
find a place
where she'll shine?

73
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:40,052
I would love to,
but I have to be

74
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,595
completely honest
with you guys.

75
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,555
We're 100% staffed up

76
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,811
Andy, let's see if there's a
good fit first then we'll talk

77
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,275
All right.

78
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,569
Knock, knock, knock
Knock, knock, knock

79
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,446
You don't have to say
it if you're doing it

80
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,573
Remember how you said

81
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,909
that you were looking
for a place in the office

82
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,328
to do calisthenics
and aerobics?

83
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,997
Ah, weightlifting, yeah

84
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:10,415
Well, today's
your lucky day

85
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,709
I have opened
in this very office building

86
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,087
Dwight Schrute's
Gym for Muscles

87
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,172
Want to take a look?
I'll take a look

88
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:21,176
Your path from
obesity begins right here

89
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:26,098
I've been meaning to join
a gym For my health.

90
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,518
I used to say I wanted to live long
enough to see a black president.

91
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,353
I didn't realize how
easy that would be.

92
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,729
So now I want to
live long enough

93
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,315
to see a really,
really gay president

94
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,692
or a supermodel president.

95
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,569
All the different
kinds of presidents

96
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,864
Obese people in my office
building are a drain on resources

97
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,574
Chairs wear out faster

98
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,535
It takes more freon
to keep them cool

99
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,203
They flush the
toilets more often

100
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,164
Plus, their massive BMs
bust the rivets on my pipes

101
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,211
But a gym turns
fat into cash.

102
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,173
All right, the DM
Express is pulling out

103
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,883
All right, well it was really
nice to meet you, Brian

104
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,135
Ah, it's actually Ryan

105
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,553
Oh, Ryan.
Yeah

106
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,555
Bitch

107
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,599
We will start
here at Erinville

108
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,684
Hi

109
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,227
Reception

110
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,937
Your classic
one-man operation

111
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,647
Although, I was
watching a movie

112
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,399
and Meryl Streep
had two secretaries

113
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,444
I was watching a movie and a bunch
of apes took over San Francisco

114
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,820
Just saying

115
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:25,407
Two secretaries could convey
a sense of importance

116
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,117
and success to our clients

117
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:30,620
Certainly worth exploring.
Wouldn't you agree, Andy?

118
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,582
I'll explore exploring it - Good

119
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,834
Seems like you have
this under control,

120
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,503
so I'll just duck out and run
the company for a while.

121
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:39,588
Okay

122
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,511
Okay, next stop
on the tour, sales

123
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,848
Here we go Station
stop Jim Halpert.

124
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,933
Oh, boy, our resident
truth teller Uh

125
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,560
All right, have at it
Let her rip.

126
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,103
What do you hate
about this place?

127
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,648
Well, it's sales,
so you have to be able

128
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,776
to live in the
world of rejection

129
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,361
Maybe you do

130
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,945
Hi, I'm Dwight

131
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,741
Sales is really not so
hard, okay It's paper

132
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,534
We have it,
and they want it so bad

133
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,119
they are willing
to pay for it

134
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,287
Jim?

135
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,623
Well, it's not that easy

136
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,208
It's kind of
sometimes difficult

137
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:18,710
It's the second-easiest
job in the world

138
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,670
Being a mom
I love shopping.

139
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,131
And sales is just
the other side of that

140
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,092
That's true

141
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,137
You know, if you joined
our sales department

142
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,098
you would be working
very closely with our

143
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,100
department head,
Mr. Dwight Schrute

144
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,184
That's me

145
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:37,229
Dwight, why don't you tell Susan
about some of your hobbies

146
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,398
Oh Mmm-hmm Survival skills.

147
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,233
Ranking of animals

148
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,776
Maybe over a beer

149
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,821
after she's closed
her first sale.

150
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:50,534
Well, make that a red wine and
I'll tell you my animal rankings

151
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,123
How am I supposed
to pull this off?

152
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,751
The entire office is being nicer to
her than they've ever been to me.

153
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,461
What I wouldn't give
for one of Phyllis'

154
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,338
classic room-clearing
farts right now.

155
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,841
Ready?

156
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,138
What do you think?
Huh?

157
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,848
Umm, no

158
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,099
No. This is not a gym

159
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,809
This is like a
scene out of Saw V.

160
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,352
You haven't even
looked around yet

161
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,603
Look

162
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:20,981
Gravel bucket squat yoke

163
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,194
Right?

164
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,446
Hmm

165
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,865
Dedicated phone
book ripping station

166
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,286
You ever cut tin before? No

167
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:37,539
Five yards in and your
forearms will be on fire

168
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,291
Plus, I will buy
the tin back from you

169
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,001
that you cut for
two cents a yard

170
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,129
Now, let's go
over membership

171
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,881
I'm gonna need
the first month's

172
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,300
and the last month's
up front for $49 a month

173
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,344
But every third
month is $59 a month

174
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,056
But the fourth month is a
discount month at $19 per month.

175
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,642
Obviously, you know
how a gym works.

176
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,187
So you know I'm not gonna
pay money for this

177
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,938
You want people to
come to your gym?

178
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,899
Make a real gym

179
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,567
Darryl

180
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:09,696
Make a real gym

181
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,574
accounting might
be a good fit

182
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,034
because I really
clicked with Oscar

183
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,703
and I do have some
experience with bookkeeping

184
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,248
But we already have a surplus
of accountants as it is

185
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,919
customer service
um, HR, even.

186
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,837
Those are fully
staffed as well

187
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,508
Are you telling me that there's
no one in this entire office

188
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,093
that could use
an extra pair of hands?

189
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,012
Yes

190
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:39,267
I am the CEO, and I am telling
an employee of mine what to do.

191
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,646
Let me beat around
the bush for a second

192
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:46,858
Our chairman of the board has
some very strong feelings

193
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,694
Robert, it's all right.
This is very uncomfortable

194
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,823
Obviously, there's no place for
me here, so thank you for trying

195
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,908
Why don't we
just let it go?

196
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,034
No.
Absolutely not

197
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,578
Andrew, there must be
something you can do.

198
00:08:58,663 --> 00:08:59,996
There must be. Think

199
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,917
Well, there are
a lot of considerations

200
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,634
It's not a bad thing
to have the CEO owe you one

201
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,307
All right
Well, then, welcome aboard

202
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,817
So what happens next?

203
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:33,446
We get you over to HR and then
get you set up with accounting.

204
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,782
Hang on

205
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,867
Hello?
- Say "hello, grandma."

206
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,329
Hi, gam-gam

207
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,040
Hold one finger up to Susan.
You'll just be a second.

208
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,876
You numbskull!

209
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,503
You were given
a very simple task.

210
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,589
More clear with you.

211
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,924
Now say, "Are you
taking your medicine?"

212
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,218
Are you taking your med-meds?

213
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:58,221
Why can you not say
exactly what I tell you?

214
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,433
Undo this. Undo it.

215
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,188
You didn't say good-bye
to your grandmother.

216
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,816
We promised we'd
never say good-bye

217
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,157
Attention! I am
now accepting memberships

218
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,451
for the Dwight Schrute
Gym for Muscles

219
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,620
First 20 members
can take advantage

220
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,788
of our "pay what
you weigh" promotion

221
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,415
All I need
is another gym.

222
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,750
As if I don't
have enough drama

223
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,669
We have a gym at home
It's called the bedroom.

224
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,879
Who's spotting who?

225
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,380
"Don't use the bike
in the corner,

226
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,923
"that's Bruce's.
Jeremy says...'

227
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,342
Enough. Oscar, enough

228
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,926
Kelly?
I have these sneakers

229
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,471
which are basically just like
a gym for your feet, so...

230
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,768
That's okay. I know
how to build a business

231
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,561
You gotta bet the
black people to do it

232
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,188
to get the white
people to do it.

233
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,732
Then you gotta get the black
people to stop doing it.

234
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,734
One step at a time

235
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,903
Did you bring your
passport with you?

236
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,738
Who walks around
with their passport?

237
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,822
Well, I do

238
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:58,990
Always ready
for adventure

239
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,450
Have you had any?

240
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,701
No

241
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,749
Hey, guys

242
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,252
So Robert doesn't want
his wife working here.

243
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,838
So now that she is,
we have to drive her away

244
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:18,051
Andy, if he didn't want her working
here, then why did you hire her?

245
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,346
Oscar, it was a mistake

246
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,266
But one that can be fixed by
all of us being mean to her.

247
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,770
How can we do that?
She's simply wonderful

248
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,146
This is all pathetic

249
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,193
How mean are
we talking about?

250
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:36,444
It would be great if
she were gone by lunch

251
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,906
Erin, you're up. Find her a place
to work but not too comfortable

252
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,409
Got it. I know exactly
which stapler to give her.

253
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:48,289
Here you go

254
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:53,378
Um, do you think it
would be possible

255
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,963
to move to that
desk over there?

256
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,216
Because this seems a bit cramped,
and I don't have a computer

257
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,718
Well, that's a sales desk

258
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:02,595
Yeah. You need to be over
here with us accountants

259
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,140
Just sit here
and be quiet

260
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,309
And if you have a question
just raise your hand

261
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:12,731
But I'm gonna save you some time,
sweetie, and give you the answer now

262
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:20,071
No, I don't think
we should be trying

263
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,614
to make this
place seem unpleasant.

264
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,241
I think we should
let this place

265
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,743
just crush her
spirit by itself

266
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,453
what it's doing

267
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,329
That's Gerald

268
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:30,832
Oh, wow. So cute

269
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,417
Oh, that is so cute

270
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,671
Oh, he's so tiny
Is he in a ladle?

271
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:37,922
Yeah, he's in a ladle

272
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:40,258
That's adorable How on earth
did you get him in a ladle?

273
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,551
He did it himself

274
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,178
Is that ladle
stainless or

275
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,471
Oh, stainless
Williams Sonoma

276
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,015
Excuse me, waiter
there's a dog in my soup

277
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:48,975
It's not that
kind of ladle

278
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:51,102
Very cute
Let me see.

279
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,229
Just the battery
on these things

280
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,106
I'm sorry,
I've gotta recharge this

281
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,110
Last time I had a job

282
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,112
I remember I hated
the boss' wife

283
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,532
Of course, she was
married to Robert.

284
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,371
Your employees don't
seem to be taking to me.

285
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,041
Andy

286
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,712
Andy, could you
step in here, please?

287
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,048
We'll fix this

288
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,467
What is going on?

289
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,676
Please

290
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,930
Ah, Andrew, my wife

291
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,726
has brought up an issue that
requires your attention

292
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,898
So, if you'll excuse me
I should step out,

293
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:42,070
get to the ATM before that homeless
man sets up camp for the night

294
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,786
Okey-dokey, artichokey

295
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:52,872
You hate it, don't you?

296
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:54,082
Do you not want me here?

297
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,376
Why would you say that?
It's okay.

298
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,336
I understand I'm not
sure how I would fee

299
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,338
about having the boss'
wife work for me either

300
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,257
It's not that exactly

301
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,633
But it is something

302
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:07,136
Let's just say that if you
don't want to work here

303
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,972
I am totally
prepared to respect that

304
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,932
Why would you not
want me working here?

305
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,475
I don't know

306
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:16,771
what you're going through

307
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,693
My husband can be a very
difficult man to read, can't he?

308
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,819
Yes

309
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,114
The dude is an enigma

310
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,366
So he is mixed up
in this, isn't he?

311
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,495
Got it

312
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,958
What do you
think you're doing?

313
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:38,293
Getting my sweat on

314
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,670
I build you this
temple to the human body

315
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,881
and you're lifting
what, five pounds?

316
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,883
I just did, like,
35 minutes on the treadmill

317
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,218
I was watching you. You want to
know how long it really was?

318
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,761
No
Eight minutes!

319
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,889
Dude, I'm gonna be
here all week, right?

320
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,600
Five days a week. I figure I'll start slow

321
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:56,352
Is that the same philosophy
you apply to buffalo wings?

322
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,692
I want you to bring that same
buffalo wing passion to this gym

323
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,486
I'm gonna make you
look like Lebron James

324
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,614
It's Lejon Brames

325
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,449
That's what I said.
Yeah

326
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,451
Get it right I know.

327
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,660
Cameras

328
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,746
Still here. Terrific

329
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,082
Andy and I had
a great conversation

330
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,669
And I just want
to let you know

331
00:15:21,795 --> 00:15:24,047
that I am not going
to be working here

332
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,675
Well, that's a shame

333
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,719
It just was one of those things...
Is it?

334
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,013
Because we
talked about it

335
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,015
and it seems like that
might be what you want.

336
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,892
Which is fine
Where did this come from?

337
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,101
Did Andy say that?

338
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,353
No, he did not

339
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,729
But I could tell
he was struggling

340
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,064
to understand what
was expected of him

341
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,525
What's the struggle? He made a
great call hired a great person

342
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,027
You sure about that?

343
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,112
Absolutely.
No games?

344
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,530
No games

345
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,866
Because Andy seemed to think
there was some information

346
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,576
he was not able
to share with me

347
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,203
Enough of this I
mean, real Enough

348
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,373
It's gotten way out of hand
Andrew, this is my wife

349
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:02,877
Whatever privacy you were trying to
protect between us, I thank you for

350
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,296
But it is not
welcome right now

351
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,382
Just be honest

352
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,053
Andy
Yes

353
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,721
Why do you keep
looking at my husband?

354
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,348
Andy, just answer
the question.

355
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:16,599
No games?

356
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,767
No games

357
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,228
Okay

358
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,981
of funny, actually.

359
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,816
Robert storms in
and he says

360
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,234
"In four seconds
my wife's gonna be in here

361
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,485
"I told her she
could work here

362
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:29,779
"Under no circumstances can
that be allowed to happen."

363
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,489
You lying son of a bitch

364
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,328
Tell my wife you're lying

365
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,500
That's not true, is it?

366
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,085
No, it's not

367
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,879
I tell the truth
most of the time

368
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,090
and I was just telling the
truth about your husband

369
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,633
Jim knows. He was there

370
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,176
This is preposterous

371
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,095
Robert
Let's get Jim in here.

372
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,807
Where's Jim?

373
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,726
He just rolled out
and crawled out

374
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:03,146
Can you call security tell them
to keep an eye out for him?

375
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:04,897
Time to settle this

376
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:07,984
Wait, wait, wait
Hold on, hold on

377
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,613
Just real quick.
Real quick, open... Okay

378
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,829
That's weird

379
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:22,623
Well, he's gotta be
around here somewhere

380
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,968
Ow! Ow

381
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,470
Ow

382
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:43,644
Creed, I was never
here, all right?

383
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,105
Okay. What about
your friend?

384
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,150
Oh, boy

385
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:56,991
This is my gym, my rules You do
exactly as I say no questions asked

386
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,910
Yeah, I'm gonna
ask questions,

387
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,495
and I might not
do what you say

388
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:03,289
First thing, we're gonna
stretch the pelvic bowl

389
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,125
Ready? Get down on the floor

390
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,960
Okay, I'm not doing that

391
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,379
Really?

392
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,173
Too embarrassing
for you? Huh?

393
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,093
You wish that every exercise was
strutting around the gym like the Fonz?

394
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,345
Well, how do you think
the Fonz got so cool?

395
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,639
He stretched
his pelvic bowl

396
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,601
Darryl joined

397
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,852
Looks that way

398
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,355
Nice pelvic bowl. Deep

399
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,526
Hello, Jim

400
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,860
No, no. No, no, no

401
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,695
Don't. Damn it, Tuna

402
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,241
So, I think you know
what we want to know

403
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,742
Do I?
Yes

404
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:41,077
I know. I do

405
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,039
Jim, I've had enough
of your unhelpfulness

406
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:48,292
I'm not really sure how I can

407
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,336
For God's sake,
did Robert tell you

408
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,421
that he didn't
want me working here?

409
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,215
That's the thing

410
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,676
See, I didn't want to get in the
middle of this Still don't.

411
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,011
But here's something

412
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,265
I feel that maybe,
if we take a step back

413
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:06,936
this is a simple case of
anxiety to work with a spouse

414
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,647
I think we've got
ourselves an answer

415
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,774
No That makes complete
sense, right?

416
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,568
Thank you all for a
wonderful day Perfect!

417
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,986
Jim
Yes?

418
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,112
Answer the question
please.

419
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,950
Want me to tell you.

420
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,661
To be really honest,
my wife works here

421
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,288
And I love it

422
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,331
She literally
makes me work harder

423
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,126
She makes me smarter. She makes
me remember why I'm here

424
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,255
And between us she's on
maternity leave right now

425
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,591
and I would love to leave
this room and see her face

426
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,428
but it's just
what I'm thinking

427
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,721
All right. Thanks

428
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,514
Yes. All right

429
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,063
Uh.

430
00:19:51,148 --> 00:19:53,232
Yeah

431
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,907
Thank you

432
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,667
Andy

433
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:14,086
Hey, Mrs. California

434
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,966
Hey. I'm sorry about the
position you were put in today.

435
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,510
You know, honestly we all
wanted you to work there

436
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:24,305
Except for him
Especially me

437
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,849
Yes, I thought we
really hit it off.

438
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,100
Yeah

439
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,144
Well, different circumstances

440
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,395
Yeah

441
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,855
Who knows?
Who knows?

442
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,274
Maybe after all
this settles down

443
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,776
Totally

444
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,237
It's a date

445
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,321
Hmm?

446
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,075
You're nothing!
You're so weak

447
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,160
You call yourself
a man? Huh?

448
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,454
This doesn't help me I don't
respond to that kind of strategy.

449
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,580
Okay, fine

450
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,917
Finish your set on your own and
never come back to my gym again!

451
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,378
Dwight, come back and spot me

452
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,506
All right, I'll help you

453
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,801
But first, you gotta
tell me what your goal is

454
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:02,885
What do you want?

455
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,011
To push this bar up

456
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,139
No! Because if that was the case,
the bar would be up by now

457
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:08,432
What is your goal?

458
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,684
Help me

459
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,560
What do you want?

460
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,354
To look good for Val

461
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,189
Val Kilmer?

462
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,483
I don't buy it
that doesn't make any sense

463
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,403
Wow

464
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,530
I figured out your goal

465
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:27,243
I am gonna make you the buffest
dude Val Kilmer has ever seen
