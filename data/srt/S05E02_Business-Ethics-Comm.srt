1
00:00:01,418 --> 00:00:02,960
Well, I should go.

2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:05,213
All right. I'll tell everybody
here that you say hi.

3
00:00:05,297 --> 00:00:06,964
No, don't.
I'm mad at them.

4
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,424
Why?
What happened?

5
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,469
Not one of them called to
congratulate me on our engagement.

6
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:12,720
Ah!

7
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:16,766
That, they might be off the hook
for, because I didn't tell them.

8
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,018
What? Why not?

9
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:22,063
I just didn't,
you know, want to deal.

10
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,856
Come on.
It won't be that bad.

11
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:27,026
Okay. You know what?
Here we go.

12
00:00:29,113 --> 00:00:31,739
Everybody, I just want
to make an announcement.

13
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:35,368
- Pam and I are engaged.
- Hi, everyone!

14
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,620
I thought you were already engaged.
Nope.

15
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:41,165
That was Roy. She was engaged to Roy.
Thank you, Angela.

16
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,086
I got a gift for Pam and Roy.
Do I have to get another one?

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,254
Yes.

18
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:49,048
A little close to my engagement
there, Tuna. What's your game here?

19
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:52,218
To get married. She's
not a virgin, you know.

20
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,302
Wow!

21
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,470
What's going on?

22
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,640
No. Nothing. Nothing, Michael.
Just saying hi.

23
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,767
The tall guy got engaged.

24
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,519
To be married?
Yep.

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:06,691
Sorry.

26
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,800
Pencils down! Just kidding.
Take your time.

27
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:34,427
Today is Ethics Day.

28
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:37,764
After they finish the quiz, I'm
going to run my first meeting here.

29
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:44,187
It's going to be insane. No, it's not.
I have to read from the binder.

30
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,108
I got it. I got it.

31
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,627
Let's get ethical, ethical

32
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,463
I want to get ethical

33
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,632
Let's get into ethics, yeah

34
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:15,301
Let me hear
Dunder Mifflin talk

35
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,469
Your body talk

36
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,846
Let me hear your body talk

37
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,264
All right!

38
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:24,101
"Why are you helping her? You're
not even dating." She's my friend.

39
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:27,021
And ultimately my strategy is

40
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,484
to sort of merge this
into a relationship

41
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,569
without her even knowing.

42
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:39,325
Okay! Let's give it up
for Miss Holly Flax!

43
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:41,494
Thanks, Michael.

44
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:44,831
Today we're going to have
a business ethics seminar

45
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,208
because recently,
without mentioning any names,

46
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,836
there has been some
misconduct at corporate

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,257
and we have a very strict ethics policy
and that employee has been fired.

48
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:58,678
Come on. He's right there.
He was hired.

49
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,347
Check it out, hired guy.
Nice.

50
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:05,101
Okay, elephant in the room.
Let's talk about it.

51
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,355
Do I regret what I did?
Of course I do.

52
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,983
Even though it was an amazing
ride and I'll give an example.

53
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,195
Anyone see Survivor, Season Six?
Anyone know JoAnna on that show?

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:20,408
In New York City, I hooked up with a
girl who looked exactly like that.

55
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,577
Indistinguishable. So...

56
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,039
Okay. Well done. Good speech, Ryan.
You're a good guy.

57
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:31,043
Let's start discussing those questionnaires
that you filled in this morning.

58
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:34,046
It is wrong to make personal
calls during work hours.

59
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:37,008
Now, some of you marked
that you very strongly agree.

60
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:39,552
But ideally, you would have
selected "totally agree."

61
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:44,223
I thought "very strongly agree" sounded
stronger than "totally agree."

62
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,767
Corporate would like
to emphasize that ideally

63
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,186
you would all totally agree
with that statement.

64
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:53,524
Well, I think we can all totally agree
that Holly is totally fantastic.

65
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,986
Thank you.
Okay. Okay.

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:00,823
In fact, spending a half hour at
the water cooler during work hours

67
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,366
is a form of stealing.

68
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:03,492
- What?
- Yes.

69
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:07,246
It's called "time theft" and it's the
same as taking money from the company.

70
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,250
Can anyone think of examples of things
that are over-the-line time wasters?

71
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,585
This meeting.

72
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,754
Can't set them up like that.

73
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,632
Why is it okay for smokers
to take breaks all the time?

74
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,385
If I want to go outside and hang out once
an hour, then I'll just take up smoking.

75
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,262
- I'll do it. I don't care.
- I'll smoke with you.

76
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,805
I got a bag of cigars
in my purse.

77
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,600
Stealing office supplies
is another big ethical area

78
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,019
that there seems to be
some confusion about.

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,146
Okay. Could we have
a moment?

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,439
Can I talk to you
for a second?

81
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,523
Yeah.

82
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:37,902
A lot of good stuff. And you look...
You look fantastic.

83
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,779
Michael.
Yeah?

84
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:41,906
What should we be working on
while you guys are talking?

85
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,783
Do some...
Do some work.

86
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,328
People expect a lot
from these meetings.

87
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,123
Laughter, sudden twists,
surprise endings,

88
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,461
you need to be Robin Williams
and M. Night Shyamalan.

89
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,088
You need to be
Robin Shyamalan.

90
00:04:57,172 --> 00:04:58,714
Well, I just have to get
through the binder.

91
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,466
You're... It's just,
you're kind of losing them.

92
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,550
I am?
Yeah.

93
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,595
Don't think about the stakes.
It'll freak you out.

94
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:08,432
Okay. Well, Michael makes
a really good point.

95
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:11,102
So, let's just open
this up a little bit.

96
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:16,107
Say my name is Lauren and here
I am shopping in a supermarket

97
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,234
and I steal a pencil.

98
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,238
That's not right. Lauren!
Enough with the pencils!

99
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,448
No. I have to go over pencils
and office supplies.

100
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,743
It's part of the ethics thing.
That isn't ethics.

101
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:31,580
Ethics is a real discussion of
competing conceptions of the good.

102
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,458
This is just the corporate
anti-shoplifting rules.

103
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:39,088
I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would
you steal bread to feed your family?

104
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:40,548
Boom!

105
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:44,427
Exactly, Andy. Yeah. I took
Intro to Philosophy twice.

106
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,637
No big deal.
It's a trick question.

107
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:49,849
The bread is poisoned. Also,
it's not your real family.

108
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,768
You've been cuckolded
by a stronger, smarter male.

109
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,979
No, that's not
how it works.

110
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:03,154
I would not steal the bread. And I
would not let my family go hungry.

111
00:06:03,238 --> 00:06:05,698
Okay. But we should
get back to business.

112
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,785
Have any of you ever faced any
ethical dilemmas in the workplace?

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,413
Anybody?

114
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,042
This is a chance for you to say
something without any repercussions.

115
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:19,545
Stanley? Oscar, come on.
I'll pass.

116
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,422
I will go first.

117
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,925
When I discovered YouTube,
I didn't work for five days.

118
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,219
I did nothing.

119
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,724
I viewed Cookie Monster Sings
Chocolate Rain about 1,000 times.

120
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,436
What was the dilemma?
To tell you or not.

121
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,815
And I'm glad I did. I feel
very, very good. Cathartic.

122
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,526
I promise you that you are not
going to get into trouble.

123
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,489
You can say anything you want
with total and complete immunity.

124
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:50,159
Oh, no, no, no. Yeah. Come on.
Anybody. Let it fly.

125
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,204
Okay. Once in a while,
I'll take a long lunch.

126
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,415
A siesta. Time thief. Time thief.
Fire him!

127
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,252
Dwight, you've really never
stolen any company time?

128
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:05,132
Never. You are a thief of joy.
Anybody else? Yeah?

129
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,219
Sometimes I download pirated
music onto my work computer.

130
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:10,930
Who hasn't? Good.
Good. What else?

131
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,765
No, I'd like to hear
more about that.

132
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:18,562
I once reported Oscar to the INS. Turns
out he's clean, but I'm glad I did it.

133
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:21,857
Well, let's keep
this party moving on.

134
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,192
I'll go.

135
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,612
Have you guys ever met Bruce Myers,
the Scranton rep for Hammermill?

136
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,155
Bruce.

137
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,741
Well, for the past six years
I have been sleeping with him

138
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:35,871
in exchange for discounts on our supplies
and Outback Steakhouse gift certificates.

139
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,164
Jackpot.

140
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,919
Meredith, that is serious.

141
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,381
I mean, not only is that
a conflict of interest,

142
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,633
but there's also
an exchange of goods.

143
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,262
Exchange of steak. Have you
ever had sirloin steak, honey?

144
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,473
That's crazy.
That's crazy talk.

145
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:59,228
Meredith, "the Merenator,"
sleeping with suppliers.

146
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:02,940
Wow!

147
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:04,150
What time we got?

148
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:06,485
You know what? That's a
good place to end it.

149
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,239
Right there. This, I think,
was a great ethics seminar.

150
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,659
She has given us a lot of
wonderful things to think about.

151
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:19,165
Right. What is wrong? Who's
to say, really, in the end?

152
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:23,210
I mean, because it is unknowable. But
let's give her a round of applause.

153
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,589
Holly, everybody! Holly!
Get back to work.

154
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,553
Great job.
I am truly impressed.

155
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,263
That... You really
pulled that one out.

156
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,765
Classic. Classic meeting.
We should celebrate.

157
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,394
Michael, there's some serious
issues with Meredith.

158
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:43,063
I mean, all of you have done things
I wouldn't have done myself,

159
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,691
but Meredith's actions
are really over the line.

160
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,235
Yeah. What are you
going to do?

161
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:59,914
So regarding this supplier, approximately
how many liaisons have there been?

162
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:05,085
Liaisons? You mean meet-ups? I don't know.
Once a month for six years.

163
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,212
Something like that.

164
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:10,424
Meredith, why don't you tell
Holly it's not what she thinks,

165
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:16,263
nothing unethical happened and that
you just like to sleep around?

166
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,474
Am I in trouble here
or something?

167
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:21,143
No. No. This is just
a stupid formality.

168
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,146
No, it's not a formality.

169
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:30,486
Now, were these "meet-ups" just
personal, unrelated to business?

170
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:33,781
No. I wouldn't have done it if it
wasn't for the discount paper.

171
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:35,532
There's not a lot of
fruit in those looms.

172
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,245
For the love of God, we're trying
to help you, you stupid bag.

173
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:44,208
What I don't understand is,
why the steak coupons?

174
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,461
I mean, if you were already
getting the discounted paper...

175
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,633
Well, it's funny, maybe it's a
girl thing, but after we did it,

176
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,845
when he would give me those coupons,
I just felt good about myself.

177
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,937
Hey, what's going on here?
I thought I had immunity.

178
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,815
Well, unfortunately, immunity or
something being off the record

179
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:10,150
does not really exist
in the workplace.

180
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,946
I mean, I've never heard of anyone who
kept their job after something like this.

181
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,156
Well, I'm not quitting.

182
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:33,465
Yawn, four seconds.
What are you doing?

183
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,135
You had said that you don't do
anything personal during work time,

184
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,470
so I'm just making sure.

185
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,182
Wait a minute. So you're going to time
me every time I yawn? That's absurd.

186
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,143
Really?

187
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,771
Hey, look, monkey knows how to
use a stop watch, everybody.

188
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,064
He's...

189
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,114
Personal conversation.
17 seconds.

190
00:10:57,282 --> 00:10:59,158
There is no way
that that was...

191
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,286
One second.

192
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:11,337
Well, well, Holly-lujah! It's a
miracle you're at your desk.

193
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:17,009
It's Mike-raculous. Reaching.
You'll get there.

194
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:22,973
Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and
there's no reason that two attractive,

195
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:29,772
good looking, intelligent,
funny, attractive people can't,

196
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,900
you know, just sit down and work
this whole Meredith thing out.

197
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:35,110
Sounds good.
Good.

198
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,282
Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
I already bought this.

199
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:45,996
No, no, no. Your food is
no good here, my lady.

200
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,415
Sorry.

201
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,294
You know what? Let's go out.
Dunder Mifflin's treat.

202
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,967
Actually, you're not a client,
so we'll just split it?

203
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,428
Ethical.

204
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,559
So, I've gone over
corporate policy.

205
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,729
What do you think? What do
you think of this place?

206
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,272
It's very nice.
Isn't it?

207
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:16,902
Yeah. It's kind of business romantic.
So you're from Des Moines.

208
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,322
Mmm.
That sounds so warm.

209
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:22,616
In summer.

210
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,745
Here, too. You know what
my favorite season is?

211
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,497
Maybe we should talk
about Meredith first.

212
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,666
Yes. Get the boring stuff
out of the way.

213
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:34,503
Autumn was what I was going to say.
When the leaves change, it's just...

214
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:38,465
I think it's the most
contemplative of seasons.

215
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,095
Okay, so I've gone over this and I've
thought about it and I just don't think

216
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:47,224
there's any way I can write a report that
doesn't end with her being terminated.

217
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,605
- Terminate her. Terminator.
- "I'm from the future."

218
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,274
Yeah.

219
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,986
Hey, Andy.
Yo.

220
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,738
By any chance, did you see
Battlestar Galactica last night?

221
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,324
No, I did not.
Was that any good?

222
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:06,410
Actually not.
It was really so-so.

223
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:07,578
Okay.

224
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,373
I mean, I like all the crazy
monsters and stuff, you know,

225
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,711
like Klingons and Wookiees
and all that, but...

226
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:20,215
Sorry, was there something
you wanted to add, Dwight?

227
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,387
Is that anything like the
original Battlestar Galactica?

228
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:29,183
You know what's weird? It's
practically a shot-for-shot remake.

229
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,559
Really?

230
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,272
That's cool.
The story's kind of bland.

231
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,733
It's about this guy named
Dumbledore Calrissian...

232
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,152
Okay... who needs to return
the ring back to Mordor.

233
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:44,072
Really.
That doesn't sound right.

234
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:51,705
I just don't want my employees thinking
that their jobs depend on performance.

235
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,751
I mean, what sort of place
is that to call home?

236
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,839
And Meredith needs this job. This
is her main source of money.

237
00:14:00,924 --> 00:14:03,842
Well, that's very sweet, but we
have to follow the protocol.

238
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:07,346
Those are the rules. Okay, new idea.
We don't report it at all.

239
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,515
We just punish her.
We punish her?

240
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,392
Tell her, "Can't have
sex for six months."

241
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,228
I don't think
we could enforce that.

242
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,898
I don't know. I saw this thing.
Like a belt with a key.

243
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,233
A chastity belt.

244
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:25,739
No, it's more of an underwear garment
that has little spikes, like, made of...

245
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:28,951
Like sometimes they're made of metal.
You know what I'm talking about?

246
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,912
You unlock
a little door that...

247
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:37,000
Down where you... Where you put...
Where you put the...

248
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:48,136
He has not stopped
working for a second.

249
00:14:49,347 --> 00:14:53,809
At 12:45, he sneezed
while keeping his eyes open,

250
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:57,229
which I always thought
was impossible.

251
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,897
At 1:32, he peed.

252
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:03,068
And I know that because he did it in
an open soda bottle under the desk

253
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,070
while filling out
expense reports.

254
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,196
And on the flip side,

255
00:15:06,281 --> 00:15:10,033
I've been so busy watching him
that I haven't even started work.

256
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,703
It's exhausting,
being this vigilant.

257
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:15,831
I'll probably have
to go home early today.

258
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:21,670
I am just saying that I don't think
that you understand what I am saying.

259
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:25,424
No, you are saying that we should
sweep it under the carpet,

260
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,927
accept the discount
on supplies, not fire Meredith

261
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:32,014
and pretend like the whole
thing never happened.

262
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,600
Yes.
What am I saying?

263
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:35,767
Well...

264
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,520
Busted. I don't...

265
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,149
I'm saying that her behavior is
unethical, and a little icky.

266
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,276
And I don't think I want
to work in an environment

267
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,486
where that sort
of conduct is tolerated.

268
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,031
Well, you have to tolerate a lot
when you're part of a family.

269
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,658
It's not a family.
It's a workplace.

270
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:09,676
I will be honest with you.
That car ride did not go well.

271
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:11,803
And that was not my fault.

272
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,139
The only reason I am
standing out here right now

273
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:17,643
is because I don't want to
take the elevator with her.

274
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,771
And I am holding
on to her leftovers.

275
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,496
Nineteen minutes
and 48 seconds.

276
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:40,707
What were we doing for 19
minutes and 48 seconds?

277
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,668
None of your business.

278
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,005
So I guess I can assume
that was personal.

279
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,680
Fine.

280
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,893
So maybe you're not
completely ethical after all.

281
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,271
Yes. Maybe I'm not.

282
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:24,292
It's been a little tense.

283
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:31,383
People are suspicious of me and my best
friend in the office won't even talk to me.

284
00:17:32,427 --> 00:17:35,846
Turns out being the morality
police does not make you popular.

285
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,557
I should know, because in middle
school I was the hall monitor

286
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,060
and the kids used to stuff
egg salad in my locker.

287
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,230
Yeah, I was just hoping
middle school was over.

288
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:54,072
Kendall from corporate HR is on line
one and Holly's on her way in, too.

289
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,742
What's the only thing
worse than one HR rep?

290
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:58,994
Two HR reps.
You get me.

291
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,248
Can I sit?
I don't know, can you?

292
00:18:06,002 --> 00:18:07,502
Kendall, my main man.

293
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,588
Listen, Holly, Michael,

294
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,423
I just got the report
that your branch submitted.

295
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:14,593
And there's a lot of stuff about a
relationship Meredith's having with a...

296
00:18:14,677 --> 00:18:16,803
Yes, that came out during
the ethics seminar...

297
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:20,599
And let the record show that it was
during the immunity part of the seminar.

298
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,560
Well, I'm not sure these
circumstances warrant any action.

299
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,812
I think it's pretty
clear it was unethical.

300
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,607
Well, from what I can gather,
it seems like a gray area.

301
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,401
Look, to be honest, the company's
getting a discount at a tough time

302
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,696
in our balance sheet and I don't know that
the right thing to do for the company

303
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,782
is to turn our
noses up at that.

304
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,951
Kendall, I understand that the
discount is good for the company,

305
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:43,455
but I'm just not happy about
the way we're getting it.

306
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,625
You see, I thought
I was clear with you, Holly.

307
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,126
Your task was
to get signatures

308
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:51,087
from the employees showing that
they completed the training.

309
00:18:51,172 --> 00:18:52,214
No, I understand.

310
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,299
Because every other branch
has managed to get this to us,

311
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,427
so if it's not something you can handle,
then that's a different discussion.

312
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,971
No. No, I can do it.
Good.

313
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:11,107
How do you tell somebody that you
care about deeply, "I told you so"?

314
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:14,861
Gently, with a rose?

315
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:20,826
In a funny way?
Like it's a hilarious joke?

316
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,330
Or do you just let it go?

317
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,042
Because saying it would
just make things worse.

318
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,213
Probably the funny way.

319
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,007
Can I have
everyone's attention?

320
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,679
Excuse me. May I have
everyone's attention, please?

321
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,806
We need to finish
the ethics seminar.

322
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,975
No way, lady.
It's a trap.

323
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:47,227
Everyone, please, I just
need your signatures

324
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,020
to show corporate that I
gave you the training.

325
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,398
Don't sign anything. Okay,
everybody, listen up,

326
00:19:51,482 --> 00:19:53,733
if you're not in that
conference room in two minutes,

327
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,193
I am going to kill you.

328
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,238
It's a quarter to 5:00 and I have
started to gather my things.

329
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:02,117
Get in there right now
or I'm going to lose it!

330
00:20:13,087 --> 00:20:14,254
Am I getting fired?

331
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,798
Now is really not
the time, Meredith.

332
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:20,218
In this next section
we examine the difference

333
00:20:20,303 --> 00:20:23,138
between sick days
and personal days.

334
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,600
Sick days are only to be used
when an illness precludes you

335
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:30,854
from doing your job or can
spread to your co-workers.

336
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,316
Personal days, on the other
hand, are much more flexible.

337
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:40,405
Thank you, Meredith, this was delicious.
Hey, where's the steak sauce?

338
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:44,910
I think we're out. I got some
in my minivan somewhere.

339
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,873
Wait a second, how does
this steak factor in again?

340
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:54,586
I think she got it as a tip, but I don't
know why she didn't just take cash.

341
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,213
I don't care what she's doing, I
hope she just keeps doing it.

342
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,633
Amen. Just keep
the ribs coming.
