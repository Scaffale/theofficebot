1
00:00:03,602 --> 00:00:05,263
<i>Dunder Mifflin
is about to be sold,</i>

2
00:00:05,337 --> 00:00:08,966
<i>but first an investment banker has
to drop by and sign off on our branch.</i>

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,874
<i>And I'm pretty
nervous about it,</i>

4
00:00:12,944 --> 00:00:17,711
and I'm making
some cosmetic tweaks

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:22,386
to help create
a more appealing environment.

6
00:00:23,555 --> 00:00:25,887
<i>Is that dishonest?
Well, think of it this way.</i>

7
00:00:25,957 --> 00:00:27,447
<i>When you look in
the mirror and you see</i>

8
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,993
<i>your push-up bra and
your fake eyelashes</i>

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,154
<i>and your makeup and
your press-on nails,</i>

10
00:00:33,298 --> 00:00:35,926
the principles that
I'm applying to the office

11
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:39,129
are the same ones that
have made Lady Gaga a star.

12
00:00:39,204 --> 00:00:41,104
Or any number of drag queens.

13
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,097
<i>Hi.
- Hello, Eric Ward.</i>

14
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:12,395
<i>Welcome to Dunder Mifflin.</i>

15
00:01:12,471 --> 00:01:16,669
<i>I am Computron,
your answer to everything.</i>

16
00:01:17,576 --> 00:01:19,203
Hello.
Hello.

17
00:01:19,277 --> 00:01:21,711
I see you've met Computron,
our virtual helper.

18
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,715
I'm Michael Scott.
Welcome, welcome.

19
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,412
Computron is just one
of the many modern devices

20
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:31,456
that I have incorporated
into the office.

21
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:33,184
<i>Watch this. Computron?
Yes.</i>

22
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:35,488
What is the world's
largest ocean?

23
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,754
<i>Calculating.</i>

24
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,228
<i>Calculating.</i>

25
00:01:39,297 --> 00:01:40,491
<i>Pacific!</i>

26
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,295
Pacific Ocean.
Pretty cool, huh?

27
00:01:43,368 --> 00:01:44,392
Great news, Michael,

28
00:01:44,469 --> 00:01:47,097
we're now the official
paper supplier of the NFL.

29
00:01:47,172 --> 00:01:51,108
That is fantastic. It's good, but
it's not good enough. Keep working.

30
00:01:51,743 --> 00:01:52,903
And here's Pam.

31
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:54,411
She's our international
sales consultant.

32
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,503
Hello.

33
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,416
<i>The NFL celebrated
its 50th anniversary in 1972.</i>

34
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,221
It might seem crazy, but since
there's no one left in New York,

35
00:02:09,294 --> 00:02:12,730
Michael is Dunder Mifflin's
highest ranking employee.

36
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,766
So, that's where we are.

37
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,259
Hello, Stanley.

38
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:18,324
Hi.

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,130
For the record, not
onboard with fake Stanley.

40
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:25,636
Although, I get it.

41
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:28,335
I just need to check out your
warehouse and then talk to your HR guy.

42
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,643
That is pretty much the only
reason that I came here today.

43
00:02:30,715 --> 00:02:32,546
Okay. Well, I thought I'd
show you around a little bit...

44
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,175
Right... Since you made the trip out.

45
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:37,380
And I got us reservations at
Coopers Seafood. You like lobster?

46
00:02:37,455 --> 00:02:38,513
You've had
lobster before, right?

47
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,614
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,691 --> 00:02:42,717
They make the best Maine lobster
in the world. You'll love it.

49
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,887
<i>Mul Yam
in Tel Aviv is better.</i>

50
00:02:44,963 --> 00:02:48,296
No, Computron, actually,
I think Coopers is the best.

51
00:02:48,366 --> 00:02:49,526
You're going to love it.

52
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:51,762
<i>Are you calling me wrong?</i>

53
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:52,996
Oh, my God.

54
00:02:53,572 --> 00:02:55,540
<i>It's called
due diligence.</i>

55
00:02:55,674 --> 00:02:57,665
<i>Basically,
I confirm inventory,</i>

56
00:02:57,742 --> 00:03:01,143
<i>take a head count, see if
there are any HR liabilities.</i>

57
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:03,710
I'm a glorified fact checker.

58
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,914
Actually,
I am a fact checker.

59
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,219
All right.

60
00:03:11,122 --> 00:03:13,022
Excuse me. If you will...
- Hey, Michael,

61
00:03:13,124 --> 00:03:15,058
do you think I could get a space
here? Follow me this way.

62
00:03:15,126 --> 00:03:18,357
I will introduce you to the
crack HR rep that you requested.

63
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,264
I give you Toby Flenderson.
Have fun, you two.

64
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:25,165
Oh, we will. Have a seat.

65
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,565
Mmm.

66
00:03:30,642 --> 00:03:34,169
<i>I left a copy of
Best American Mystery Stories 1999</i>

67
00:03:34,245 --> 00:03:38,011
in Toby's favorite stall. So,
yes, I think I bought us some time.

68
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:43,217
So, the manager,
Michael Scott

69
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:45,851
is a bit of a character.

70
00:03:45,924 --> 00:03:48,620
He has more character in a
single flake of his dandruff

71
00:03:48,693 --> 00:03:52,220
than you have in that entire
snow bank on your shoulder.

72
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:54,530
So, what was the question?

73
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,590
What are you
doing at my desk?

74
00:03:56,735 --> 00:03:58,760
Ignore him.
He's the local lunatic.

75
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:00,498
Come on, Dwight,
get out of here.

76
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:02,334
Dwight? Who is this Dwight?

77
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:03,465
Oh!

78
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:05,742
You mean Dwight Schrute,

79
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,109
the company's top salesman
and the creator of Computron.

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,705
I wear many hats, but the
one I'm wearing currently

81
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:12,772
is that of gracious host.

82
00:04:14,452 --> 00:04:15,714
Welcome.

83
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,123
Sorry. Hey, Toby Flenderson.
Nice to meet you. How can I help?

84
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,262
Are there any outstanding
liability issues to be aware of?

85
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,389
What do you mean?

86
00:04:27,465 --> 00:04:31,663
Well, safety issues,
injuries that could leave

87
00:04:31,736 --> 00:04:34,796
the company open to
any potential lawsuits.

88
00:04:35,407 --> 00:04:36,533
Um...

89
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,467
Nothing comes to mind.

90
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:40,135
<i>Mike, get off
of the lift. Please!</i>

91
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,200
<i>Come on, now.</i>

92
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,371
<i>I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.</i>

93
00:04:42,447 --> 00:04:44,039
Look, would you...
Look...

94
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:52,450
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

95
00:04:52,657 --> 00:04:53,988
We're the ones
that gotta clean that up!

96
00:04:54,592 --> 00:04:55,581
I feel very blessed.

97
00:05:05,236 --> 00:05:06,863
Drop that sucker.

98
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:09,373
Yeah! Bingo!

99
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:15,002
Do it!
Yeah!

100
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,589
Today, smoking is
going to save lives.

101
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:29,349
- Run, run.
- Okay, okay.

102
00:05:29,427 --> 00:05:31,088
Calm, please.

103
00:05:31,162 --> 00:05:32,220
Oscar!

104
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:33,594
Stay alive, I'm getting help!

105
00:05:33,665 --> 00:05:35,098
Pull me up!
You're too heavy.

106
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,394
I only weigh 82 pounds.

107
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,002
Save Bandit!

108
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:44,998
Seriously, are you
gonna sit in the back?

109
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,244
Yeah. It's the safest
part of a car.

110
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,646
In the event of a crash, the driver
always protects his side first.

111
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:07,253
My hair!

112
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:10,397
Get off! Get off me!

113
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,457
I got it! I got it!

114
00:06:11,536 --> 00:06:12,798
Get it off!

115
00:06:23,081 --> 00:06:24,673
You're welcome.

116
00:06:26,384 --> 00:06:29,785
So, the staff,
are people generally happy?

117
00:06:35,727 --> 00:06:37,695
Happy is a funny word.

118
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,795
In what way?

119
00:06:39,931 --> 00:06:41,330
You know...

120
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:45,860
You know, what does
it mean to be happy?

121
00:06:48,473 --> 00:06:51,101
Keep philosophers
busy for a while.

122
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:53,474
So, generally?

123
00:06:53,545 --> 00:06:54,603
Yes.

124
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:56,670
Generally.
Generally happy.

125
00:06:56,748 --> 00:06:58,010
Generally happy.

126
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:07,818
I don't know what streets
we... Ow! What are you doing?

127
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,359
It would be better
if you were unconscious.

128
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:11,819
Ow!

129
00:07:11,896 --> 00:07:14,763
Try my googy googy. Try
my googy googy. Try my...

130
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:17,894
Excuse me.
Don't touch me!

131
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,067
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

132
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,232
Can't we all just get along?

133
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:28,507
Or have we forgotten the words
of the Reverend King?

134
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:33,273
What about non-safety issues
in terms of liability?

135
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:35,581
Sexual harassment?
Anything like that?

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,950
Well, I don't know.

137
00:07:40,091 --> 00:07:41,820
You don't know?

138
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,150
I don't know.

139
00:07:44,562 --> 00:07:46,291
You're the head
of human resources.

140
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:47,388
I don't know.

141
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,489
No.
Okay.

142
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:54,004
Stanley? How about that hot
picture you have by your desk?

143
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,097
Centerfold in the
Catholic schoolgirl's outfit?

144
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:59,371
I mean, it is hot, it is sexy,
and it turns him on.

145
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:03,437
And I will admit, best part
of my morning is staring at it.

146
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,072
But what? Are we gonna
just take it away?

147
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:08,118
That is my daughter, she goes
to Catholic girls' school.

148
00:08:09,254 --> 00:08:10,915
Michael.
Come in!

149
00:08:12,123 --> 00:08:13,249
Hey!
Oh, my God!

150
00:08:13,324 --> 00:08:14,416
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

151
00:08:14,492 --> 00:08:15,754
You said, come in! No, I didn't!

152
00:08:15,827 --> 00:08:17,590
Just, please, get out. Oh, my God!

153
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,422
What's wrong
with my outfit?

154
00:08:20,498 --> 00:08:23,262
You might consider
pulling it down a touch.

155
00:08:23,334 --> 00:08:25,962
Bunch of prudes. You know,
Oscar's allowed to wear sandals,

156
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,800
But I'm not
allowed to wear open-toed shoes?

157
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:29,339
Is that how it goes?

158
00:08:29,407 --> 00:08:30,669
Meredith, your boob is out.

159
00:08:30,742 --> 00:08:31,800
Fine.

160
00:08:31,876 --> 00:08:33,707
Too
far, Meredith! Too far!

161
00:08:33,778 --> 00:08:35,712
Damn it, Meredith,
where are your panties?

162
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,077
It's casual day.

163
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:38,945
Come here, give me a kiss,
come on.

164
00:08:39,017 --> 00:08:41,349
Michael, come on, you
don't have to worry. I'm not

165
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:44,354
gonna report you to HR.
I'm not... I'm not worried!

166
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:46,287
You know what? The only
thing I am worried about

167
00:08:46,991 --> 00:08:48,754
is getting a boner.

168
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,986
I'm now going to read aloud your
submitted medical conditions.

169
00:08:53,064 --> 00:08:55,123
When you hear yours read,
please raise your hand

170
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,564
to indicate
that it is real.

171
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:59,535
If you do not raise your
hand, it will not be covered.

172
00:08:59,604 --> 00:09:01,697
Number one,
inverted penis.

173
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:09,043
Could you mean vagina? Because
if you do, I want that covered.

174
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:11,809
I thought your vagina was
removed during your hysterectomy.

175
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:16,980
A uterus is different from a
vagina. I still have a vagina.

176
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:22,253
Attention, everyone. Hello.

177
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:26,058
Yes, I just want you to know
that, this is not my decision.

178
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,792
You can consider this
my retirement from comedy.

179
00:09:28,866 --> 00:09:31,664
Does that include
"that's what she said"?

180
00:09:33,004 --> 00:09:34,028
Yes.

181
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,005
Wow, that is really hard.

182
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:40,375
You really think
you can go all day long?

183
00:09:41,245 --> 00:09:45,011
Well, you always left me
satisfied and smiling, so...

184
00:09:46,884 --> 00:09:48,146
That's what she said!

185
00:09:48,219 --> 00:09:49,948
Michael!

186
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:51,883
Why did you
get it so big?

187
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:53,514
That's what she said.

188
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:56,122
Does the skin look
red and swollen?

189
00:09:56,194 --> 00:09:57,661
That's what she said.

190
00:09:57,729 --> 00:10:00,027
That's my joke.
Damn it, Dwight.

191
00:10:00,098 --> 00:10:02,658
How about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute?

192
00:10:02,734 --> 00:10:03,894
You already did me.

193
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:05,401
That's what she said.

194
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:06,630
Is there any mustard?

195
00:10:06,704 --> 00:10:09,832
No mustard! No mustard!
Just eat it!

196
00:10:09,907 --> 00:10:11,465
Eat it, Phyllis.
Dip it in the water

197
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:13,066
so it'll slide down
your gullet more easily.

198
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,202
That's what she said.

199
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:15,267
Oh,
no, no, no, no, not that...

200
00:10:15,346 --> 00:10:17,041
Just come on,
you guys, let's do it.

201
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:25,914
<i>I don't know how
I'm going to get through this.</i>

202
00:10:26,257 --> 00:10:28,020
<i>I don't want to lie.</i>

203
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:30,884
And I don't want
to tell the truth.

204
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,895
Hey, Tobes, what you doing?
What you guys talking about?

205
00:10:36,968 --> 00:10:39,198
We're just going
over some stuff.

206
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,363
Stuff? I love stuff.

207
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,872
It's HR stuff.

208
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,740
<i>HR stuff? H.R. Pufnstuf.</i>

209
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:50,739
Right up my alley. What is
that? What kind of stuff is that?

210
00:10:50,815 --> 00:10:53,375
It's a company
evaluation form.

211
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:54,475
Ah!

212
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,608
We're talking about...

213
00:10:55,686 --> 00:10:57,551
Talking about what?

214
00:10:58,456 --> 00:10:59,445
Waste is next.

215
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,718
Waste?

216
00:11:01,059 --> 00:11:03,721
What does that even mean?
Like garbage?

217
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:05,262
No, waste of time,
resources.

218
00:11:05,329 --> 00:11:07,092
Oh! Time and resources.

219
00:11:08,132 --> 00:11:09,326
Look, you know,
in any company,

220
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,526
there's gonna be
a certain degree...

221
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:14,935
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Respectfully, Toby, no.

222
00:11:15,006 --> 00:11:17,839
No. This company does not
waste time or resources ever.

223
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,552
Dig deep. Dig deep.

224
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,087
It's Phyllis,
Phyllis by a nose.

225
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,926
Gold medal in Flernenton.
Flonkerton.

226
00:11:41,566 --> 00:11:43,193
Where is my desk?

227
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:45,827
That is weird.

228
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:50,298
Happy holidays, Dwight. But
do not open it till Christmas.

229
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:52,365
You're so pathetic. Well,
I hope it was worth it,

230
00:11:52,443 --> 00:11:55,173
because I'm going to take it
apart in about five minutes.

231
00:11:55,246 --> 00:11:56,838
I think it'll take you a
little bit longer than that.

232
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:59,610
If I can skin a mule deer
in less than 10 minutes,

233
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:00,844
I ought to be
able to cut my...

234
00:12:04,689 --> 00:12:06,520
Damn it! Jim!

235
00:12:06,591 --> 00:12:08,058
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

236
00:12:08,126 --> 00:12:10,594
Judge is in session.
What is the problem here?

237
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,390
He put my stuff
in Jell-O again.

238
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:17,367
Bang, boom,
shake, klump!

239
00:12:17,635 --> 00:12:20,627
Why, hello, everybody.

240
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,336
What are you doing?

241
00:12:25,409 --> 00:12:28,674
Question, what kind
of bear is best?

242
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:30,874
That's a ridiculous question.

243
00:12:30,948 --> 00:12:32,745
False. Black bear.

244
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:34,341
Well, that's debatable.

245
00:12:34,418 --> 00:12:35,851
There are basically
two schools of thought.

246
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,286
Fact, bears eat beets.
Oh...

247
00:12:38,856 --> 00:12:40,881
Bears, beets,

248
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,153
<i>Battlestar Galactica.
Bears do not...</i>

249
00:12:43,761 --> 00:12:46,491
What is going on?
What are you doing?

250
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,659
Identity theft is
not a joke, Jim!

251
00:12:51,302 --> 00:12:53,395
Millions of families
suffer every year!

252
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:55,700
Michael!

253
00:12:55,773 --> 00:12:57,866
Oh, that's funny. Michael!

254
00:12:58,042 --> 00:12:59,669
Is anyone near
retirement age?

255
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:04,274
This is Creed.

256
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:06,782
And he is in charge
of something.

257
00:13:06,851 --> 00:13:07,943
Right?
That is correct.

258
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,646
Say hi to the kids.
Hi, kids.

259
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,812
Yay!

260
00:13:10,888 --> 00:13:13,755
Have you ever seen a foot
with four toes? KIDS: Ew!

261
00:13:13,824 --> 00:13:16,884
What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it! Just... No, no, no, no, no!

262
00:13:16,961 --> 00:13:17,950
Would you cut it out?

263
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,096
Okay. Ryan, you told Toby

264
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,622
that Creed has a distinct
old man smell?

265
00:13:26,037 --> 00:13:27,629
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

266
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:31,232
<i>I sprout mung beans on a damp
paper towel in my desk drawer.</i>

267
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:34,107
Very nutritious,
but they smell like death.

268
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,405
Hey, where's Dwight?

269
00:13:36,547 --> 00:13:37,673
You didn't hear?

270
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:42,481
Decapitated. Whole big thing.
We had a funeral for a bird.

271
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:46,156
I'm pretty sure
none of that's real.

272
00:13:46,224 --> 00:13:47,657
You're not real, man.

273
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:53,457
Hey. Yeah, I finally got a
chance to sit down with HR.

274
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:55,825
So...

275
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,932
Well, I think I'm gonna
be here for a while.

276
00:14:01,539 --> 00:14:05,498
This is a building where
friends become lovers,

277
00:14:06,277 --> 00:14:11,510
and lovers become
sexually interactive, right?

278
00:14:11,582 --> 00:14:12,640
Would you agree with that?

279
00:14:12,717 --> 00:14:15,117
Michael, this is really
inappropriate to talk about.

280
00:14:15,186 --> 00:14:16,653
That is true.

281
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:17,946
Mmm.

282
00:14:31,502 --> 00:14:32,969
I like you.

283
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,469
But you need to access
your un-crazy side.

284
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,340
Darryl Philbin is the most
complicated man that I've ever met.

285
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:43,041
I mean, who says exactly
what they're thinking?

286
00:14:45,383 --> 00:14:46,782
What kind of game is that?

287
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:50,385
I am so happy we don't
have to break up now, Ryan!

288
00:14:51,922 --> 00:14:53,480
It is the best day
of my whole life!

289
00:14:53,691 --> 00:14:56,626
When I said that
I wanted to have kids,

290
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:00,323
and you said that you wanted me
to have a vasectomy, what did I do?

291
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,889
And then, when you said that
you might want to have kids,

292
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,936
and I wasn't so sure, who
had the vasectomy reversed?

293
00:15:06,003 --> 00:15:07,994
And then when you said you
definitely didn't want to have kids?

294
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,334
Who had it reversed back?

295
00:15:09,407 --> 00:15:11,568
Snip, snap! Snip, snap! Snip, snap!

296
00:15:11,642 --> 00:15:12,768
I did!
- Okay...

297
00:15:12,843 --> 00:15:18,042
You have no idea the physical toll
that three vasectomies have on a person!

298
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:20,011
Kelly, I'm your
boss now, okay?

299
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:22,143
You can't keep talking to
me like I'm your boyfriend.

300
00:15:22,219 --> 00:15:25,518
Oh, big strong man,
fancy new whatever.

301
00:15:25,589 --> 00:15:26,749
I don't think you
ever cared about me.

302
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:27,950
I never cared about you?

303
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,788
Six months ago, Karen
Filippelli sent me an email,

304
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,555
asked me out,
I said no,

305
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:33,290
because I was committed
to our relationship.

306
00:15:33,364 --> 00:15:35,924
Well, I hope you're still
committed, because I'm pregnant.

307
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,637
This is an image

308
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:45,966
that I want you people to
remember for a long time to come.

309
00:15:46,043 --> 00:15:47,305
Whenever you come
into the office,

310
00:15:47,378 --> 00:15:49,346
I want you to
think about this.

311
00:15:49,814 --> 00:15:51,475
We don't need to.

312
00:15:51,549 --> 00:15:52,914
Yes, we do.
What?

313
00:16:08,966 --> 00:16:10,228
I did it!

314
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:14,000
Thank you.
Thank you.

315
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:16,629
Jim has got it bad for Pam.

316
00:16:16,707 --> 00:16:19,175
Oh! Which one is Pam?

317
00:16:20,911 --> 00:16:22,674
What?
Nothing.

318
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,811
Okay.
What?

319
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:28,049
I don't know. What?

320
00:16:29,186 --> 00:16:30,210
Oh, my God!

321
00:16:30,721 --> 00:16:32,211
Did you wanna
tell me something?

322
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,655
You look like you want
to tell me something.

323
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:36,659
You look like you have
something really important to say

324
00:16:36,727 --> 00:16:39,218
and you just can't
for some reason.

325
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,924
Come on, you can tell me.

326
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:46,134
Jim, you can tell me anything.

327
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:55,407
You have new music?

328
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:56,537
Yeah.

329
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:58,880
Definitely.

330
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,085
Bring it in.
Here we go.

331
00:17:17,101 --> 00:17:18,500
Look inside.

332
00:17:23,707 --> 00:17:25,140
Oh, my God!

333
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:31,815
But I bet Jim got the job.

334
00:17:31,882 --> 00:17:36,046
I mean, why wouldn't he? He's
totally qualified and smart.

335
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,485
Everyone loves him.

336
00:17:37,555 --> 00:17:39,489
<i>If he never comes back again,</i>

337
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:40,956
<i>that's okay.</i>

338
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:42,921
<i>We're friends.</i>

339
00:17:42,993 --> 00:17:44,824
We just... We never
got the timing right.

340
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:46,522
But you know what,
it's okay.

341
00:17:47,565 --> 00:17:49,396
I'm totally fine.

342
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,729
Everything is
going to be totally...

343
00:17:50,801 --> 00:17:52,029
Pam.

344
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:53,194
Sorry.

345
00:17:54,438 --> 00:17:56,167
Are you free for

Yes.

347
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:00,542
All right.
Then it's a date.

348
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:11,117
I'm sorry.
What was the question?

349
00:18:12,156 --> 00:18:13,555
Oh, my God.

350
00:18:16,327 --> 00:18:18,693
Pam, will you marry me?

351
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:19,854
Oh, my God!

352
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:04,502

353
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,406

354
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:07,910
It's nice to meet you all.

Good to meet you.

Have a great day.
Thank you.

357
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:11,772
Hope to see
you soon. KEVIN: Yeah.

358
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,079
<i>I feel very sorry
for that banker because</i>

359
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:16,483
<i>he has to evaluate
what we are worth.</i>

360
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:21,390
He has to decide what we're
capable of. And how do you do that?

361
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:27,590
<i>What is Jim capable of?
Or Pam? Or Kevin?</i>

362
00:19:29,099 --> 00:19:31,693
<i>Out of paper, out of stock</i>

363
00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:35,104
<i>Those friendly faces
around the block</i>

00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:37,197
<i>Break loose
from the chains</i>

365
00:19:37,641 --> 00:19:39,836

you pain</i>

<i>Call Michael
and Stanley, Jim, Dwight, Creed</i>

<i>I don't care if he
goes and files a report</i>

375
00:19:58,529 --> 00:20:00,190

we're nothing special</i>

376
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:04,394
<i>because I think our
future is very bright.</i>

377

00:20:06,737 --> 00:20:09,968
<i>Computron
experiencing emotion.</i>

379
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,908
Computron, I'm going to
pull your plug, okay, buddy?

380
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,503
<i>Okay.
Just...</i>

381
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:20,706
<i>Please don't.</i>

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,412
<i>Computron wants to live.</i>

383
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:26,183
Shut... Shut up. Shut up.

<i>Sittin' in my office
With a plate of grilled bacon</i>

<i>In the Electric City!</i>

<i>They call it Scranton!
What?</i>

390
00:20:45,142 --> 00:20:47,667
<i>The Electric City! Scranton! What?</i>

391
00:20:47,745 --> 00:20:49,042

go in the compact spot!</i>

00:21:10,034 --> 00:21:12,867
