1
00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:05,961
Could you please sign
my expense report?

2
00:00:06,037 --> 00:00:09,063
No way, no how. Expense
reports are a day-to-day item.

3
00:00:09,141 --> 00:00:13,134
That is Jim's now. I am
exclusively big picture. Epic.

4
00:00:21,453 --> 00:00:23,216
Sign this.
Uh-uh-uh.

5
00:00:23,288 --> 00:00:25,222
Where's the please?
We're not animals.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,814
Sign it.

7
00:00:26,892 --> 00:00:28,223
No. Not without a please.

8
00:00:29,694 --> 00:00:30,888
Idiot.

9
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:36,195
I have a complaint
about Jim.

10
00:00:36,268 --> 00:00:38,293
That is not
big picture.

11
00:00:38,837 --> 00:00:43,740
I would like to file a huge,
enormous, massive complaint

12
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:46,607
about the tallest guy
in our office.

13
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,209
Okay.

14
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,748
Jim won't sign
my expense report.

15
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:57,948
That is not...
Okay. Day-to-day.

16
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,684
That is day-to-day.
No. That is huge.

17
00:00:59,758 --> 00:01:03,319
You're trying to trick me. Get out,
get out, get out, get out, get out.

18
00:01:06,798 --> 00:01:08,322
I'd like to lodge
a complaint.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,630
I'm sorry to hear about that.
Who is this about?

20
00:01:10,702 --> 00:01:11,828
You.
Okay.

21
00:01:11,903 --> 00:01:14,497
Just want to let you know I
take complaints very seriously,

22
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:17,007
so, when did
this happen?

23
00:01:17,075 --> 00:01:18,099
One minute ago.

24
00:01:18,176 --> 00:01:20,440
Okay. And how
do you feel?

25
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:21,536
Angry.

26
00:01:21,613 --> 00:01:23,547
All right. Did he hit you? No.

27
00:01:23,615 --> 00:01:25,344
Did you cry?
No.

28
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:26,748
Did you feel like crying? No.

29
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:29,548
I'm just going to write,
"Held back tears."

30
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,782
Wait, stop writing that.
That is not true.

31
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,051
If you stop crying,
I'll stop writing it.

32
00:01:33,124 --> 00:01:34,216
I'm not...

33
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,424
I deserved that
promotion. Not Jim.

34
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:42,524
Oh, man, makes me want to put
him in a triangle choke hold

35
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:44,728
and force him
down to the ground

36
00:01:44,803 --> 00:01:46,862
and just keep
pressing and pressing,

37
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:51,705
and then flip him over and then put
him in a hammerlock and he's gasping.

38
00:01:51,776 --> 00:01:53,767
He's panting for
every last breath.

39
00:01:53,845 --> 00:01:58,248
And the crowd is going crazy
and boom, I emerge victorious!

40
00:01:59,484 --> 00:02:02,282
Eighteen thousand dollars
and a chance at the title!

41
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,617
Dwight, Jim wants you
to keep it down.

42
00:02:41,526 --> 00:02:43,653
Everyone, now would be
a good time to freshen up

43
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:45,025
because I'd like
everyone to meet

44
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,654
in the conference room
in five minutes.

45
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,096
And I suggest that
you bring a snack

46
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:49,599
because we may be
in there for a while.

47
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:50,692
Michael.
Yes.

48
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,361
Can I talk to you in my
office for a second? Mmm...

49
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:55,565
Sure. But could I first
talk to you in my office?

50
00:02:58,443 --> 00:03:00,434
Can I also be a boss?

51
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:01,945
Look, it doesn't
take a genius to know

52
00:03:02,013 --> 00:03:05,380
that any organization thrives
when it has two leaders.

53
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:08,784
Go ahead, name a country that
doesn't have two presidents.

54
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,617
A boat that set sail
without two captains.

55
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:14,557
Where would Catholicism be
without the popes?

56
00:03:14,626 --> 00:03:16,059
I have noticed
that we...

57
00:03:16,127 --> 00:03:17,492
Welcome.

58
00:03:17,562 --> 00:03:19,291
Thank you. I have
noticed we've been having

59
00:03:19,364 --> 00:03:21,355
a lot of conference
room meetings. Mmm-hmm.

60
00:03:21,433 --> 00:03:24,596
And I'm wondering if
perhaps those are a bit...

61
00:03:24,669 --> 00:03:25,761
Disruptive.
Yes.

62
00:03:25,837 --> 00:03:30,297
No. I don't think they are. I think
the meetings are very important.

63
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,605
Okay. Maybe we
should talk specifics.

64
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:34,304
Let's do.
Okay.

65
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:37,246
Yesterday we had
a meeting about planets.

66
00:03:37,315 --> 00:03:42,082
Well, to be fair,
Jim, James... Jimothy.

67
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:45,780
To be fair, Jimothy...
That sounds weird.

68
00:03:45,857 --> 00:03:46,949
Are you okay with
being called Jim?

69
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,185
I am.
All right.

70
00:03:48,259 --> 00:03:49,521
Jim, to be fair,

71
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:50,891
the conversation
wasn't about planets.

72
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:51,986
Right.

73
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:53,621
At first, we were
talking about

74
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:56,166
introducing a line
of toilet paper.

75
00:03:56,234 --> 00:03:57,360
And what part
of the human body

76
00:03:57,435 --> 00:04:00,165
does one use
toilet paper upon?

77
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:03,538
So you draw a line from
there to the other planets,

78
00:04:03,608 --> 00:04:05,075
and I think by the end, we all learned

79
00:04:05,143 --> 00:04:06,940
a little bit about
how small we are.

80
00:04:07,012 --> 00:04:08,172
Yes, I agree.
I just feel...

81
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:09,508
Because it's
a big universe.

82
00:04:09,581 --> 00:04:12,880
And we're all just little
tiny specks of dust.

83
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,443
I just think that maybe they're
eating large amounts of the day.

84
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:18,716
You know what eats a large
amount of the day are naps.

85
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,020
You go to sleep, it's light
out, you wake up, it's dark.

86
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:24,926
That's the whole day. Where
did that day go? I have no idea.

87
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:27,797
You mean
on a weekend?

88
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,958
Yes.

89
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:32,765
How about this?
I think our goal should be

90
00:04:32,837 --> 00:04:35,601
we don't have meetings unless
they're absolutely essential.

91
00:04:35,674 --> 00:04:38,370
All right. No more
meetings this week.

92
00:04:38,443 --> 00:04:41,105
Really?
You just agree to that?

93
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,806
I can be very
surprising.

94
00:04:49,821 --> 00:04:50,981
What's going on?

95
00:04:51,056 --> 00:04:53,547
I need to fit into
my wedding dress.

96
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,683
However,
I'm also pregnant.

97
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:01,088
You know, it's a myth
that women have to gain

98
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,430
more than nine pounds
in a pregnancy.

99
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:06,698
Look at these actresses.
Some of them lose weight.

100
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:10,369
Hey, did you guys register
for wedding gifts?

101
00:05:10,442 --> 00:05:13,502
We did, but mostly because
people expect us to.

102
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:18,042
We're also accepting other
gifts not on the registry.

103
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:21,550
However much.

104
00:05:21,619 --> 00:05:25,646
It's awkward asking people for
money. But we could really use it.

105
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:31,261
Why doesn't Crate and Barrel let you
register for a toaster full of cash?

106
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:32,990
Perfect.
I hate registries.

107
00:05:33,064 --> 00:05:34,122
Oh, good.

108
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,158
My cousin makes the most amazing
romantic birdhouse mailboxes.

109
00:05:38,236 --> 00:05:41,535
I know I shouldn't tell you, but you'll
still be surprised when you see it.

110
00:05:41,606 --> 00:05:43,836
You're not registered
for a birdhouse, are you?

111
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,375
No, we're not.

112
00:05:45,443 --> 00:05:46,876
Good. Good.

113
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,346
Mmm-hmm.

114
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:56,283
Okay. I thought
I saw people missing.

115
00:05:56,354 --> 00:06:00,381
Yeah. Just focus grouping a product
expansion idea to these folks.

116
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,948
Got one of each.
Really?

117
00:06:02,026 --> 00:06:03,425
Hey, Stanley, what was
the last thing Michael said

118
00:06:03,495 --> 00:06:04,519
before I came
through the door?

119
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:05,824
Stanley, you don't
need to answer that.

120
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:07,262
Stanley?

121
00:06:07,332 --> 00:06:09,300
"If you don't smell
this, you're fired."

122
00:06:09,367 --> 00:06:10,857
Okay, Michael,
I thought we agreed

123
00:06:10,935 --> 00:06:13,096
to not take up people's time
with meetings like these.

124
00:06:13,171 --> 00:06:16,072
What do you mean
by "these" people?

125
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:17,540
Michael, this is a
conference room meeting.

126
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,805
Oh, hey, everybody, I think
that Jim has gone insane

127
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:23,370
because he thinks that my
office is a conference room.

128
00:06:23,448 --> 00:06:24,437
That's not
what I meant.

129
00:06:24,516 --> 00:06:27,917
Listen, Jim, no offense,
but when push comes to shove,

130
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:30,477
what I want is more
important than what you want.

131
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:31,681
I disagree.

132
00:06:31,756 --> 00:06:32,814
What do you
guys think?

133
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,518
Can
I go back to my desk now?

134
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,583
Great. Guys, can I just have a
moment alone with Michael, please?

135
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:38,253
No, no, no, no. You
don't need to go anywhere.

136
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:39,921
Anything that Jim
has to say to me,

137
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:42,193
he can say in front of
these types of people.

138
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,167
That is not what I said.

139
00:06:44,235 --> 00:06:45,759
And also,
I am co-manager,

140
00:06:45,837 --> 00:06:47,532
meaning you are not
the only manager anymore.

141
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:48,970
I am also a co-manager.

142
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,268
That is not what
Wallace told us.

143
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:51,467
That's exactly what
Wallace told us.

144
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:53,977
That is not the way
I heard it.

145
00:06:54,045 --> 00:06:56,479
I love rivalries.
Michael or Jim,

146
00:06:56,548 --> 00:07:00,245
Paris or Nicole, Heidi
or L.C., it's so much fun.

147
00:07:00,318 --> 00:07:02,309
But I guess if I'm
really thinking about it,

148
00:07:02,387 --> 00:07:04,321
and answering your
question honestly,

149
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:08,883
I'd have to go with L.C. Heidi's a
bad friend and her skin is terrible.

150
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,020
It is one thing me giving
you the co-manager title,

151
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,223
it is another thing
you bossing me around.

152
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:15,288
I'm not bossing you around.

153
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,561
I'm trying to do my job,
which is sharing your job.

154
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,466
So maybe we should
just call David Wallace.

155
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:21,664
No, no, no. No! We will
not call David Wallace.

156
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:23,070
I will call
David Wallace.

157
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:25,075
David Wallace is on
line two for you guys.

158
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:28,271
Or David Wallace will call us
on line two. Why don't we just...

159
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:30,143
Hey, David. You got
Jim here. Hey, David.

160
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,342
This is Michael,
senior co-manager.

161
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:36,978
<i>Hey, guys. I'm
calling because unfortunately</i>

162
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:39,049
<i>we will not be
able to give out</i>

163
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:40,681
<i>cost of living
raises this year</i>

164
00:07:40,758 --> 00:07:42,589
<i>and I know
people expect it.</i>

165
00:07:42,694 --> 00:07:45,720
<i>However, there just is only a small
amount of money for each branch.</i>

166
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:48,095
<i>So, we're leaving
it up to the managers</i>

167
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,656
<i>to decide how
to distribute it.</i>

168
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:53,795
Got it, Dave. Sounds like your
classic big picture decision.

169
00:07:53,872 --> 00:07:56,636
Which will clearly affect the
day-to-day wellbeing of our employees.

170
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,936
<i>It's probably
a little of both.</i>

171
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,067
Which is it more of?

172
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:00,235
<i>Excuse me?
Hey, David,</i>

173
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:01,573
I know that I am
very new at this,

174
00:08:01,646 --> 00:08:03,637
but I have a very good
perspective on how things work...

175
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:07,014
<i>Wait, I'm sorry. Michael,
are you texting me?</i>

176
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,679
I thought maybe we could
talk after this is over.

177
00:08:10,755 --> 00:08:12,848
<i>Look, I need you both
to take care of this.</i>

178
00:08:12,924 --> 00:08:15,051
<i>This is not going to
be a problem, is it?</i>

179
00:08:15,126 --> 00:08:16,115
Nope, not at all.
Not at all. Nope.

180
00:08:16,194 --> 00:08:17,218
No, it will not be.

181
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:18,284
<i>I am on top of it.
Very good.</i>

182
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:20,126
All right. Thanks a lot,
David. Talk to you later...

183
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,962
Okay, you didn't
let me say goodbye.

184
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,599
All right, I am looking
forward to this.

185
00:08:26,671 --> 00:08:27,695
You don't have to lie.

186
00:08:27,772 --> 00:08:30,366
I hate the fact that we have
to do this together.

187
00:08:30,441 --> 00:08:32,306
I think we work
much better separately.

188
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:36,507
When I am irritated and I look
at you, I don't see you anymore.

189
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:37,912
Right.
All I can see

190
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,314
is how big and gross
the pores on your nose are.

191
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,580
All right.
Let's get started.

192
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,292
Hey, why haven't we ever...

193
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:52,590
We have.

194
00:08:56,634 --> 00:08:58,158
You know, there's no
easy way to do this.

195
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:01,797
I say we add 1.5%
to their paychecks

196
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:03,738
and don't say
anything about it.

197
00:09:03,808 --> 00:09:05,867
Do you mean, like, break in,
in the middle of the night

198
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,172
and change the numbers
on payroll?

199
00:09:07,245 --> 00:09:08,769
No, we can do it
during the day.

200
00:09:08,846 --> 00:09:10,279
It doesn't have to be
that dramatic, Jim.

201
00:09:10,348 --> 00:09:11,713
Okay.

202
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:16,311
You know what would help is a
pros and cons list for our options.

203
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,211
Jim, don't take this
the wrong way.

204
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:20,257
Are you going to take
this the wrong way?

205
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:21,349
It's hard to tell so far.

206
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:22,757
You use your brain
too much.

207
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:24,624
I'm sorry, are you
advocating that I use it less?

208
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:27,790
Sometimes the smartest
people don't think at all.

209
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:29,662
You just came up with
that. As I was saying it.

210
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:31,065
Yeah.

211
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,697
Okay, so for the 1.5% increase,
pro, everyone gets a little bit.

212
00:09:35,773 --> 00:09:37,604
Con, you look
like a nerd.

213
00:09:37,675 --> 00:09:40,439
Con, no one gets as much
as they did last year.

214
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:43,776
Pro, you get to share your pros
and cons list with the other nerds.

215
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:45,645
Pro, no favoritism.

216
00:09:45,717 --> 00:09:48,618
Con, you unzip your pants
and you'll find

217
00:09:48,686 --> 00:09:50,586
that there's a calculator down there.

218
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,752
I've been studying
Michael for years

219
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,953
and I've condensed what
I've learned into this chart.

220
00:09:57,028 --> 00:09:58,586
How Michael
spends his time.

221
00:09:58,663 --> 00:10:01,530
As you can see, we have
procrastinating and distracting others.

222
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,762
And this tiny sliver here
is critical thinking.

223
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,338
I made it bigger so that
you could see it.

224
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:14,968
Hey, Pam. I heard that you were
registered, but I didn't hear where.

225
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:20,640
I don't think we registered
anywhere. We just want cash.

226
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,217
Like money? Like,
you want my money?

227
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,584
Mmm-hmm.

228
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,656
Will you take a check?

229
00:10:29,193 --> 00:10:30,217
Yeah.

230
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:31,283
Cool.

231
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:38,661
In the memo line, I'm going to
write, "To love's eternal glory."

232
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:41,027
Okay.

233
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,299
Wait till Monday.

234
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:48,608
Is this what I've become?
Materialistic? Shallow?

235
00:10:49,647 --> 00:10:54,607
I feel horrible. Oh,
look! "Mrs. Pam Halpert!"

236
00:10:55,753 --> 00:10:58,813
That's the first time
I've seen it in writing.

237
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:01,424
You know what,
the more I think about it,

238
00:11:01,492 --> 00:11:04,620
the more I think we should
give it to the salesmen.

239
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:05,957
That will not
go over well.

240
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,657
Yeah, I know, I just
think it seems smart

241
00:11:07,732 --> 00:11:09,359
to keep the salesmen
happier right now.

242
00:11:09,434 --> 00:11:11,629
Of course, I know this
might come off as biased,

243
00:11:11,702 --> 00:11:14,136
so you know what?
Let us...

244
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,638
Oh, my God,
are you going to make

245
00:11:15,706 --> 00:11:17,333
another pro and con list?
I'm going to kill myself.

246
00:11:17,408 --> 00:11:19,171
Well, I'm not going to let
you stop me from thinking.

247
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:21,143
No, I could not
do that, Jim.

248
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:23,407
I can see it in your
crusty little eyes

249
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:25,608
that you are going to make
everything perfect.

250
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:28,481
"If I could just
think this through,

251
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,181
"if I could just
think it exactly right,

252
00:11:31,255 --> 00:11:33,519
"I can make this perfect.

253
00:11:34,158 --> 00:11:36,126
"And then I can go
down every avenue,

254
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:38,253
"and every avenue
off of that avenue.

255
00:11:38,329 --> 00:11:39,819
"And then another avenue..." Michael.

256
00:11:39,897 --> 00:11:40,886
"And then another."

257
00:11:40,965 --> 00:11:42,159
Look, you have
a lot of strengths.

258
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,133
Oh, I do?
Tell me what they are.

259
00:11:44,202 --> 00:11:46,693
I think that you
are able to take

260
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:48,102
constructive criticism
very well.

261
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:51,039
Ha! That, I am not
known for that.

262
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:52,940
But there is a reason
why I'm here.

263
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,671
Yes, you went over
my head to Wallace.

264
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,236
No, it's because you also have
a lot of weaknesses, Michael.

265
00:11:57,315 --> 00:12:01,081
Okay, well, why don't you
tell me what those are, Jim?

266
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:02,585
Why don't you
enliven me?

267
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,382
I don't think you're good
at making tough decisions.

268
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:05,479
Ah!

269
00:12:05,556 --> 00:12:08,992
At thinking out the options and then
stating that decision very clearly,

270
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,028
especially when it's
an unpopular decision.

271
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:14,394
Okay. Here's a tough decision
for you, you suck. You suck.

272
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:16,160
Michael, wait. Is that
clear enough for you?

273
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:21,536
Maybe I'm here for a reason, because
I might have some good ideas, too.

274
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:23,836
I've been sitting out there
and I've been learning a lot

275
00:12:23,908 --> 00:12:27,036
and maybe I can just bring
something different to the table.

276
00:12:27,111 --> 00:12:28,544
Okay, Skippy, here we go.

277
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:31,844
Why don't you run yourself
out there and tell them?

278
00:12:32,483 --> 00:12:33,882
You call it.

279
00:12:39,924 --> 00:12:41,824
This had better be terrible.

280
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:43,383
Could I have everyone's
attention, please?

281
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:46,453
I have some tough news, so I'm just
going to give it to you straight.

282
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:49,398
Truth is we only have so much
money for raises this year.

283
00:12:49,467 --> 00:12:50,456
So the simple fact is,

284
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,935
some people will get raises
and some people won't.

285
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:54,596
Now what
we've decided is

286
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:57,300
we are going to give those
raises to the sales staff.

287
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,672
Wait, seriously?

288
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:01,906
Look, you guys are smart,
so I'm just leveling with you,

289
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:03,469
just trying to treat
you like adults.

290
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,949
Thank you, Jim, for thinking
that we're smart people.

291
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:08,645
But I do not understand.

292
00:13:08,719 --> 00:13:12,120
If we're such smart adults,
then why don't we get raises?

293
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,885
Excellent question,
genius.

294
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,550
It's because Jim wants
to give the raises

295
00:13:15,626 --> 00:13:17,491
to his friends and the
people he sleeps with.

296
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:18,620
Ooh! Easy,
that's not it at all.

297
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:19,685
Well?

298
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:21,163
Really, what it is,
is about the money

299
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,859
the sales staff brings
in to the office...

300
00:13:22,934 --> 00:13:23,923
What's going on?

301
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:26,834
Jim is only giving raises
to the salesmen.

302
00:13:27,004 --> 00:13:28,869
What the hell? Why are
you being such a jerk?

303
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,602
Hold on, Kelly, would it help you
to know that Jim thinks you're smart?

304
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:34,907
No. How is that going
to repair Ryan's car?

305
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,504
This is ridiculous!
How can he do this to us?

306
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:38,776
Okay, Dwight,
you know what?

307
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:40,077
You'd be getting
the raise, so...

308
00:13:40,151 --> 00:13:42,847
What about all these people?
How is it fair to them?

309
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,012
- Exactly.
- Totally.

310
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:46,648
We work just as hard as the
salespeople, we deserve raises.

311
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:47,713
Yes.
Yes.

312
00:13:47,792 --> 00:13:49,419
They don't get them
if we don't get them.

313
00:13:49,493 --> 00:13:53,156
My kid needs shoes. You want to
tell him he doesn't get shoes?

314
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:54,220
Yeah.

315
00:13:54,298 --> 00:13:55,595
Her kid needs shoes, Jim.

316
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:57,156
What the hell?

317
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,274
Wow. I'm just going to rewind
and back off a bit, so...

318
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:16,084
That was good.
That was good.

319
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,778
Okay, all right.
Well, we all know

320
00:14:18,856 --> 00:14:20,187
it's hard to be
a boss, right?

321
00:14:20,258 --> 00:14:24,251
You know what? Look around you,
these are your best friends.

322
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:29,496
These are the people who
will open their hearts to you.

323
00:14:29,567 --> 00:14:33,799
They all have
heart-ons for you.

324
00:14:34,372 --> 00:14:36,101
And that is a gift.

325
00:14:36,607 --> 00:14:40,008
So in terms of gifts, we should
be giving each other gifts.

326
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:43,638
Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar.

327
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:45,079
This is... What are you
talking about? Michael!

328
00:14:45,149 --> 00:14:47,982
We just need to hear
your plan for our raise.

329
00:14:48,052 --> 00:14:52,318
My plan, a man, Panama.

330
00:14:53,124 --> 00:14:54,386
That's not how that goes.

331
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,393
You're not saying anything. At
least Jim was being direct...

332
00:14:57,461 --> 00:14:58,450
Thank you, Meredith.

333
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,087
...when he was telling us
his dumbass plan.

334
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:01,529
We would just like
to know what's happening.

335
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,590
Are we getting a raise,
yes or no?

336
00:15:03,668 --> 00:15:06,000
All right, let me get this cleared.
Does everybody want a raise?

337
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,264
Yes!

338
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:09,169
All right,
everyone wants a raise,

339
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,004
so what we're going
to do is go into here

340
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:14,203
and we will not
come out until we do.

341
00:15:14,745 --> 00:15:15,973
Again, that gives us
no information.

342
00:15:16,047 --> 00:15:19,141
This isn't a game,
you know, it's our livelihood.

343
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,420
What about a raise
based on merit?

344
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:26,251
Rank each person
individually.

345
00:15:26,324 --> 00:15:28,189
Mmm-hmm.
Piece of cake.

346
00:15:28,826 --> 00:15:30,259
Ryan is obviously
the best.

347
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:32,023
Obviously.
Too bad he's a temp

348
00:15:32,096 --> 00:15:33,529
and doesn't count,
so let's get started.

349
00:15:33,597 --> 00:15:34,894
Are you making a...

350
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,990
Nope, I'm numbering the paper.

351
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:38,933
Just...
Yeah. I don't understand

352
00:15:39,003 --> 00:15:41,369
how they can even
consider giving money

353
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,771
to some people
and not the rest of us.

354
00:15:43,841 --> 00:15:46,241
It's not like we're not going to
see the checks, we're in Accounting.

355
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,073
I am so pissed
at this company.

356
00:15:48,145 --> 00:15:49,134
And Jim.

357
00:15:49,213 --> 00:15:51,340
Yeah.
Who said that?

358
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:53,477
I think it was Creed.

359
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:54,540
Yep.

360
00:15:59,223 --> 00:16:01,088
It's going really
well, actually. Mmm-hmm.

361
00:16:01,158 --> 00:16:03,888
Each Boston baked bean
represents half-a-percent raise.

362
00:16:03,961 --> 00:16:04,950
We each got 24 beans,

363
00:16:05,029 --> 00:16:07,361
so the idea is,
you place the bean

364
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:10,264
on the picture of who
you think deserves...

365
00:16:10,334 --> 00:16:12,131
Who's that?
Toby.

366
00:16:12,203 --> 00:16:13,568
Okay, he's not a part
of this, you know that.

367
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:15,571
Just wanted to draw
a picture of him.

368
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,038
Okay, your move.

369
00:16:17,108 --> 00:16:18,666
All right. Who to pick?

370
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:20,634
Who to pick?

371
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,735
Here we go.

372
00:16:21,812 --> 00:16:25,714
I will skip a turn.

373
00:16:25,783 --> 00:16:27,944
Okay, you're going to still have
to play that bean, you know that.

374
00:16:28,018 --> 00:16:29,349
I need more time.

375
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,487
Wallace sent an email
about a meeting next week,

376
00:16:38,562 --> 00:16:40,792
he wants you
both to respond.

377
00:16:57,681 --> 00:17:00,878
People are starting to notice
how terrible Jim is.

378
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:04,318
It's great. Eventually,
they will rise up and revolt.

379
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,619
My only hope is that they do
it sooner rather than later.

380
00:17:07,691 --> 00:17:09,886
If the people here were
our Founding Fathers,

381
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,758
the Revolutionary War would
have been delayed 10 years

382
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:15,993
because Stanley Washington
was napping.

383
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:20,400
And Phyllis Hancock was
still signing the Declaration,

384
00:17:20,471 --> 00:17:24,635
and Kevin Jefferson was
distracted by a butterfly.

385
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:29,372
Come on in. That's right.
Come in, feast your eyes.

386
00:17:29,447 --> 00:17:33,747
They determine our worth
by putting beans on our faces.

387
00:17:33,818 --> 00:17:34,842
What the hell?

388
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,285
Things were not this bad
when just Michael was manager.

389
00:17:37,354 --> 00:17:38,753
Hey, what are you guys
doing in here?

390
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:40,051
What does a bean mean?

391
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:44,754
Why aren't there any beans on this
very old, frizzy-haired picture of me?

392
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,161
Michael,
what does a bean mean?

393
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:48,289
Jim?

394
00:17:48,365 --> 00:17:49,389
I was just trying
to be unbiased.

395
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,798
What does a bean mean?

396
00:17:50,868 --> 00:17:51,960
Someone please
explain it to Kevin.

397
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,561
Why can't you? My time is
just as valuable as yours.

398
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,367
Not according
to the beans.

399
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,840
This is how you make
this important decision?

400
00:17:58,909 --> 00:18:03,107
There's no way that Stanley
gets more beans than me, that is ridiculous.

401
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:06,178
This is how it works.

402
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:09,918
It's not so much that I might
not get a raise, it's just demeaning.

403
00:18:09,987 --> 00:18:14,856
Thank you. That is exactly... But,
by the way, I would also like a raise.

404
00:18:14,925 --> 00:18:16,688
Yeah, I would, too.

405
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,227
Are we idiots?

406
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:23,832
What right does
Jim have to claim authority?

407
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,663
Is he as good
a salesman as I?

408
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:29,638
Is he as matronly
as Phyllis?

409
00:18:30,107 --> 00:18:33,736
There are moments where
we can affect change.

410
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:38,805
For a few seconds,
every decade, we exist.

411
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,644
And these are those seconds.
Let us storm his castle.

412
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,554
Come on, tick,
let's get him, tock.

413
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:52,328
Let's get Jim. Tick, and drag
Jim out of his office, tock,

414
00:18:52,396 --> 00:18:55,763
take his keys away from
him, tick, that's a clock.

415
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:59,269
The time is getting very
close. It's now or never.

416
00:18:59,336 --> 00:19:00,826
What say you?

417
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,298
I say no.

418
00:19:03,374 --> 00:19:06,036
No, I mean, what do you say to my plan?

419
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:10,942
Michael Scott...
Security guard.

420
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:12,505
Michael,
will you help us?

421
00:19:14,618 --> 00:19:16,051
What does
a bean mean?

422
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:22,358
How you doing?

423
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:25,418
On a scale of one to 10,
I'd say I'm about a four.

424
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:27,696
What are you usually?

425
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:29,665
Six. You?

426
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:32,566
Usually a 10, but I'm
feeling like a zero.

427
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:34,194
I mean,
a performance-based raise

428
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,704
sounded like
a good idea, right?

429
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,297
I know, I know.

430
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,841
We tried to find
the fairest way to do it.

431
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:39,967
Yes, we did.

432
00:19:40,044 --> 00:19:41,409
I just...

433
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:45,840
What?

434
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,376
Um...

435
00:19:48,052 --> 00:19:49,542
Nothing. I just...

436
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:53,283
I used to have to do this part
alone. And it was the worst.

437
00:19:56,427 --> 00:19:58,486
I have something
I would like to give you.

438
00:19:58,562 --> 00:20:01,053
Michael, come on!
This isn't fair! KEVIN: Michael!

439
00:20:02,099 --> 00:20:05,068
Michael's my only friend
left in the office.

440
00:20:05,636 --> 00:20:08,935
Except Pam. I think.

441
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,368
She still upset?

442
00:20:12,543 --> 00:20:15,740
Michael, you cannot
just keep avoiding us like this.

443
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:20,138
Thank you.

444
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:21,206
You're welcome.

445
00:20:23,387 --> 00:20:24,877
What's in here?

446
00:20:24,955 --> 00:20:26,013
Gin.

447
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:36,991
Ooh.

448
00:20:45,075 --> 00:20:46,667
Just
pretend we're not here.

449
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:52,139
Heard you guys are looking
for cash for the wedding?

450
00:20:52,216 --> 00:20:54,514
Yeah, I mean, if it's
all the same for you.

451
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:55,609
Question for you,

452
00:20:55,686 --> 00:20:59,816
would you guys rather have $100
now or $5,000 a year from now?

453
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,221
$100 now, for sure.

454
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:04,021
Because you just give me
$50 to cover the broker fee,

455
00:21:04,094 --> 00:21:06,562
I put in $100 of my
own money, as the gift.

456
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,157
Yeah. No, no. The $100.
I'll just take the $100.

457
00:21:11,235 --> 00:21:13,669
Instead of
$5,000 a year from now?

458
00:21:15,072 --> 00:21:16,630
How sure is this?

459
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,231
The guy has an algorithm

460
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:22,074
to determine the winner of any
given college basketball game.

461
00:21:28,185 --> 00:21:29,584
Don't tell Jim.
