1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:05,379
Phew! Wow. It is raining
cats and dogs out there.

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,214
Holy moly

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,551
Phyllis says the same 12
clichés every time it rains.

4
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,555
So, I promised everyone that if
she says them all by noon today,

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,099
I will send out
for hot chocolates

6
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:18,600
So how was the drive in?

7
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,519
Nobody knows how to
drive in the rain.

8
00:00:20,603 --> 00:00:21,937
You don't say?
Yeah.

9
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,441
You know the roads are actually the
slickest in the first half hour?

10
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,987
I think it's the oil, it comes to the surface.
- I agree

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:34,533
Ooh! The plants are
gonna love this. Yeah

12
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,041
PHYLLIS I actually sleep
better when it's raining

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,292
Tell me about it

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,378
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Just one.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:49,465
"This weather makes me want to stay
at home, curled up with a good book.'

16
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:55,095
Phyllis, this rain, does it make
you want to be doing something?

17
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,764
What do you mean?

18
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,350
You know, like, aren't some things
just so nice and cozy in the rain?

19
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:03,020
Hey, come on Lots of things
are cozy in the rain.

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,732
And that's noon
Exactly!

21
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,568
Sorry about that
everybody.

22
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,946
Hey, Phyllis would you
like a hot chocolate?

23
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,073
Ooh, I'd love one

24
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,658
I'm going out to get
two hot chocolates

25
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,207
the rain would make me
want to stay at home,

26
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,625
curled up with
a good book

27
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,211
but everybody's being
so nice to me today.

28
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,837
I'm really happy
being here

29
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,949
My girlfriend's back and
there's going to be trouble

30
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,742
Hey, la, hey, la,
his girlfriend's back

31
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,786
Hey, la, hey, la,
my girlfriend's back

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,997
A month ago, I walked
out of this office

33
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,833
positive I was
never coming back

34
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,794
I probably shouldn't
have emailed everyone

35
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,963
telling them exactly
what I thought of them

36
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:13,090
Hey, Erin, thank you
for the nice email.

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,094
Yeah. I don't get emotional
a lot but that was...

38
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,847
I'm just glad to know I had an impact

39
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,520
In other news Erin and
Andy are back together

40
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,148
Crazy story
Yes

41
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,151
down to Florida,
she was not expecting it

42
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:34,069
totally swept her off her feet.
Right? Yeah.

43
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,237
How long
was the drive?

44
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,989
It's like a day and
a half each way.

45
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:40,450
But when I got there, I went right
up to the house, and I was like

46
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,495
Day and a half? My lumbar
would be killing me.

47
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,374
You should get this lumbar
support cushion thing my dad has

48
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,750
What's it called?
Um

49
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,128
Not Easy-Rest

50
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,338
That gas must've cost
a pretty penny, huh?

51
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,631
Well
he's got a Prius

52
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,049
How many times you fill the tank?
Three, four?

53
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,177
What does gas
cost down there?

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,345
Lumbar Buddy
Lumbar Buddy

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,555
Oh, yeah
Lumbar Buddy.

56
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,473
Tell you what,
I'll email you the story

57
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,142
It's a real
tearjerker, though

58
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,768
So read with caution

59
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:08,353
Anyway, I know it's
the end of the day.

60
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,813
We just wanted to
stop by and say hi

61
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:12,399
And then later on, we have
a reservation at Patsel's.

62
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,776
Miss Lumbar

63
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,237
Hey, Kev
Yeah.

64
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,948
Nice sweater
Thank you

65
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,118
Nellie was nice enough
to give it to me

66
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,705
She's sweet I just
wish there was pockets

67
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,209
What happened
to Old Salty?

68
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,793
Nellie let me
bobble-ize him

69
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,087
His name is now
Captain Mutato.

70
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,924
I've written quite a bit
of X-Men fan fiction.

71
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,760
Captain Mutato is
half-man, half-mermaid

72
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:41,929
So he can fight
crime as a man

73
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,639
and make love
as a mermaid.

74
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,267
Most of my writing
involves the latter

75
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,982
Okey-doke

76
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,986
Yes?

77
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Whoa

78
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,870
Well, you must be the famous Nellie
Bertram I've been hearing all about

79
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,540
I am the famous Andy Bernard you
have been hearing all about.

80
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,417
Oh, yes I just want to thank you

81
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:15,420
for jumping in and
minding the store

82
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,880
during my temporary absence

83
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,258
You are most welcome

84
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,678
Anyway, now that I'm back I would
love to have my office back,

85
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,805
whenever you get a chance. No

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,935
Obviously we'll figure
out the logistics

87
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,437
of moving all of this
stuff out of here.

88
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:36,566
But, you know the sooner the
better Get back to normalcy

89
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:37,943
Mmm. No

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,240
Thank you

91
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,534
Okay

92
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,702
Wait. Uh

93
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,955
When I showed up here
there was no manager

94
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,082
It's like when the Americans
showed up at the Moon

95
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,458
Nobody was there

96
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,043
So they planted
their flag,

97
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,753
and it's their
moon now, isn't it?

98
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,924
Nobody likes it but it's
America's bloody moon

99
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:04,344
Just lay him in his crib
and then bicycle his legs

100
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:05,679
And then after
Jim quiets down

101
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,139
you do the same thing
with your baby.

102
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:10,934
But if he keeps having
problems, just give me a call

103
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,477
Oh, my gosh
thank you so much

104
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,770
But seriously, we don't
want to bother you

105
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:15,063
any more than we already have.
That's it

106
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,940
It's no bother.
You guys are our friends

107
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,067
Ravi, our amazing
paediatrician,

108
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,320
was asking us if
we knew any girls

109
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,947
and I said, "I know
the perfect girl.'

110
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:28,952
Yeah. Because Kelly is
Indian and Oh, that's it

111
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:32,581
Race had nothing
to do with it.

112
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,458
I just knew they'd
be good together

113
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:35,959
Why?

114
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,337
Kelly has been
a handful in the past.

115
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:39,838
But she's had
a bad influence.

116
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:42,924
She's like an addict, and I
just had to get her clean.

117
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,843
Get lower

118
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:47,429
Next, I'm going to set up
my sister with Darryl.

119
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:48,930
Okay, we get it

120
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:51,516
What? I think they'd be good together.
Really?

121
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,689
Um, also, little tip,
never shake the baby

122
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:01,276
Sorry, just to be clear, you're
saying do not shake the baby?

123
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,444
Don't shake the baby

124
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,863
A lot of times parents get
frustrated because the baby's crying

125
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:08,909
and they shake the baby
and you got to...

126
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:09,993
You can't do that

127
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,787
Don't shake our baby
Yeah.

128
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,497
Okay, I'd never
heard that before

129
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,581
Oh, my God
So, thank you

130
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,666
Yeah, I'm glad you said
something Me, too.

131
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,878
Kelly and I broke up and she
can do whatever she wants.

132
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,089
And her new boyfriend
seems awesome,

133
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,007
if you're into
Indian people

134
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,634
I'm not

135
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,054
And that's
when I realized

136
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,014
if you're gonna put a
thermometer in one end,

137
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,308
you'd better put a
lollipop in the other.

138
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,561
Hey, I'm sorry Is this a
workplace or a Starbucks?

139
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,314
Because I was under the
impression it was a workplace.

140
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,732
Maybe I'm
the crazy one

141
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,984
No. No, we're sorry.
Come on, let's go, Ravi

142
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,987
Also, since when do we have
guests here without clearance?

143
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,325
Hey, um

144
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,453
What's the deal with this guy?
He's really into Kelly, huh?

145
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,664
Yeah, they're
really great together

146
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,249
Makes me wonder
if I made a mistake

147
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,544
No, no, no. Come on I think you
guys are both happier now, right?

148
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,046
You're single. Plenty of
girls to date, right?

149
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,340
Yeah

150
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,593
Maybe we weren't right
together but it's weird

151
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:12,264
I'd rather she be alone
than with somebody.

152
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,182
Is that love?

153
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,895
That's about it, yeah

154
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,316
Well, Nellie picked up
the slack around here

155
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,278
while you were trolling
the Florida beaches for ta

156
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,363
like some college student
on spring break.

157
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,825
I had to tell Erin
how I felt

158
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,869
Andy, I appreciate
your romantic quest

159
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,705
and in an age before the
telephone or Internet,

160
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,082
or written language
that would be compelling

161
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,626
But there are five six
devices in this room alone

162
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,379
that would have let you tell her
that without ever going to Florida.

163
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,257
We live in
amazing times

164
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,426
Yeah, I know
I screwed up

165
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,138
But I always do
whatever you ask of me

166
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,515
and this will never
happen again.

167
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:58,894
And if Erin decides she's made a
mistake and returns to Florida?

168
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,565
At least she knows how I feel,
and I would not follow her.

169
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,363
What if she were kidnapped by a
gang of Albanian human traffickers?

170
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,450
Like in Taken?

171
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,701
What?

172
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,953
Yes, of course
if she's taken.

173
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,164
That's what I'm talking
about By Albanians

174
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,333
I would stay
in this office

175
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:25,086
Wow, okay. I'll
remember you said that

176
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:32,844
Nellie

177
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:38,600
you've been terrific
in your interim capacity

178
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:41,061
but Andrew is
the rightful manager

179
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,939
so if you would just
give him his office

180
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:45,982
No.
I'm sorry?

181
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,945
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

182
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,448
I'm not accustomed to
people saying no to me

183
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,493
Well, Bobby,
get accustomed to it

184
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:01,957
because then it feels so good
when they finally say yes.

185
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,675
You're both adults
I'm sure you can

186
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,429
figure this out
between yourselves

187
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,728
desire to influence
a business decision

188
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:28,191
So, I find it best to
recuse myself temporarily

189
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,901
until I've had
a chance to make love

190
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,739
and then go back and analyze
the situation rationally.

191
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,536
Buffett operates
the same way.

192
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,082
I want to order the zebra
rug for my office,

193
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,167
but can you dye it
entirely black?

194
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,879
No, I still want it
to be a zebra.

195
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,507
Well, I'll know

196
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,844
Because they're
ridiculous creatures

197
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,429
They don't know
what they are.

198
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,931
Phyllis says J. Duffy's
might be more our speed

199
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,851
And if we want even the option
of drawing on the placemats...

200
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,314
of an anger problem

201
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,899
Got me in some trouble
a couple years ago.

202
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,693
When I see him
start to get mad,

203
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,322
on his arm like this

204
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,826
It reminds me to just
check out and relax

205
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,873
There's also a lullaby they used to
sing to me when I was growing up.

206
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,337
The state of Pennsylvania
is watching over you

207
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,758
No need for parents,
the governor will do

208
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,301
It's really nice

209
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:41,973
The General Assembly's
like a mom and a dad

210
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,437
...had

211
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,359
about a trespasser

212
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,111
Yes. Right this way

213
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,993
Because they are idiots.
Big, stripy, horsey idiots

214
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:04,287
What you don't... Hey

215
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,831
Hank, please remove
Nellie from my office

216
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,166
Hank, thank God
you're here.

217
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,585
This psychopath keeps
barging into my office

218
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,587
It's my office

219
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,675
Well, she's sitting
there like a manager

220
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,511
And you're standing
up here like me

221
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,765
But maybe it's a little
more complicated than that

222
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,898
I'm going to
count down from five

223
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,025
and if you're not
out of my office

224
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:36,820
I'm going to
dock your pay $100

225
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:39,280
Five, four

226
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,740
You can't dock my pay

227
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,536
Three, two, one

228
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,830
Congratulations,
you just lost $100

229
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,164
Really?

230
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:53,420
Angela
dock Andy's pay $100

231
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,921
On it

232
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,634
Great Five, four,
three two, one.

233
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:04,806
Angela, please dock
Nellie's pay $100.

234
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,352
Hmm?

235
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,604
Is she responding? Hmm

236
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:14,649
Angela? Do you want to go again?

237
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,651
Angela!
Let's go again

238
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,487
Five, four, three
two, one.

239
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,699
Oh, she's counting again
Look out.

240
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:26,119
Angela, $200
- Got it

241
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,329
Seriously, Angela?

242
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:33,626
I know what,
let's go $10,000

243
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:36,504
Five, four You're
just saying numbers.

244
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,381
It's meaningless.
Three

245
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:42,927
It's literally like
Two, one

246
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,028
There you go

247
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,698
Hey, we're going to
have a nice hot date

248
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,245
What are you guys
talking about?

249
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,247
Charlie Rose I don't know who that is

250
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,332
Guys
He has...

251
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,958
Guys, come here

252
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,213
What are you...
Come on

253
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,675
Where are we going?

254
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,386
Okay. Do you guys want

255
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,388
Andy, you should
not stand there.

256
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,058
The warehouse guys
pee there all the time

257
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,435
Ew

258
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:37,106
Okay. Do you guys want to
be part of something huge?

259
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,150
I'm already a member of the
largest club there is.

260
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,610
Non-churchgoing
Christians.

261
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,906
You remember in
the movie Rudy,

262
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,867
when the player comes
into the coach's office

263
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,869
and he throws his jersey
down and he's like,

264
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,412
"I'm not playing
without Rudy.'

265
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,873
And the coach is like,
"One guy. No big deal.'

266
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,584
But then every player
comes in, one by one

267
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,963
and they all throw their jerseys
down for Rudy. Remember that?

268
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,090
Yeah, I remember that

269
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,717
So, how amazing
would it be

270
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,846
if you guys all
did that for me

271
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:11,516
with your own brand new
Dunder Mifflin jerseys?

272
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,476
Hey, guys

273
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,069
Gross. Gross, gross

274
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,445
You don't need to go

275
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,573
while I was journaling,

276
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,157
and they reminded
me of you.

277
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:30,994
Those are from our weekend
at the time-share.

278
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,954
Yeah, the fractional
ownership property

279
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,457
We took this one right before
we got in that huge fight

280
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:38,960
God, I don't even remember
what that fight was about.

281
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,044
You were being
really bratty about

282
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,212
where we would
go out to dinner

283
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:45,675
but all I remember is how pretty you
looked taking those pictures of me

284
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,512
Anyway, if you want to
order prints of your own,

285
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,849
Yeah, that'd
be cool. Thanks

286
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,017
I'd like that

287
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,061
You were so annoyed that I
was taking that picture

288
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,022
Someone's into my abs

289
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,652
Sorry

290
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,615
You have doubles of this one, I
could probably just take one

291
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,908
I really want both

292
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,661
I am seeing a side of Ryan
that I have never seen

293
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,413
since the last time
we were broken up

294
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:18,166
with Kelly Kapoor

295
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:21,252
And I don't know how I'm going
to feel tomorrow or the next day

296
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:26,049
or the day after that, but I do
know that right here, right now

297
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:30,011
all I can think about is spending
the rest of my life with her.

298
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,514
Again, that could change

299
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,187
Hey. So, last night
was so not a big deal

300
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:40,855
Oh, yeah,
I was just tired

301
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,065
We both were
Yeah.

302
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,901
Plus I was definitely
not my normal sexy self

303
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,905
No. Are you kidding?
You were so sexy.

304
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:52,533
Just the thought of you last
night like, crazy turns me on

305
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,038
It just didn't last night
But you were so dang doable

306
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,456
Even though we didn't do it

307
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:02,251
Well, it's not like we can't do it
again when Whenever you're ready.

308
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:06,714
Uh, yeah. We are sexing it up tonight.
I don't care what you say

309
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,550
No. It will be consensual

310
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,719
Whether you like it or not

311
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,014
Sounds good
I'm gonna do you

312
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,641
Not if I do you first.
Oh

313
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,562
But really
it's not a big deal

314
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:29,529
Yeah. I know it's
not a big deal.

315
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,703
Oh, hey, instead of lunch do
you feel like going shopping?

316
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,747
Are you serious? Yes

317
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:43,376
That would be... I can't
Can you believe this?

318
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,211
Hey, can you believe it? Nope

319
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,922
Hmm

320
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:51,217
Oh, do you want that dress in
every size and every color?

321
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,677
Yeah, it's free returns

322
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,139
getting along
with Ryan again

323
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,268
He's so sweet He pointed
to my latte and he said

324
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,770
"Kelly, that would be
the color of our children.'

325
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:05,815
God. Yeah, he's so great

326
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,445
Remember how it felt when
he cheated on you, though?

327
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,863
Which time?

328
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:18,786
I am not going to let Kelly
throw her life away on Ryan

329
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:23,166
And it has nothing to do with
access to my pediatrician

330
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,626
Why you would even ask
or were going to ask

331
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,087
Because I feel like
that question was coming

332
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,548
But, you know, whatever
Ask me anything.

333
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,759
When you lost the
manager job Yes?

334
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:36,345
...did it affect you
outside of the office?

335
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,638
How?

336
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,600
I don't know what
the technical term is

337
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:45,730
Penial softy-osus

338
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,985
Erin, I am so glad
that you trusted me

339
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,988
You came to the exact
right person for this.

340
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,450
No, I have never once experienced
anything remotely like that.

341
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,660
Ever, ever. Never

342
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,166
Okay?
Okay

343
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:08,002
Washington Monument
Okay

344
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,298
Eiffel Tower!
Okay

345
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:15,093
Colossus at Rhodes

346
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:19,430
Hey! I hear you've been
badmouthing me to Kelly

347
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,934
All I did was remind her that
you used to treat her badly

348
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:26,437
Well, that's your opinion and it's
her opinion, but it's not my opinion

349
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,899
If you have something bad to say
to me, Pam say it to my face

350
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,818
Fair enough. Um

351
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,656
a very good person

352
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,992
And forgive me, but I feel like
I've said this to you before.

353
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:45,123
Well, a lot of people would say that I'm
a better match for Kelly than Ravi is

354
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,377
Come on, Ryan, really?
Ravi's way better.

355
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,004
For Kelly?
Yeah.

356
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,967
Man, you're insane right now
Ravi's the whole package.

357
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,302
I've never met Ravi
personally,

358
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,929
but I'm going to
go ahead and say

359
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,682
just having known you
a short while, Brian,

360
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:07,061
that I prefer Ravi, and again
I've never even met the guy.

361
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:10,189
Kelly, look around
Nobody believes in us

362
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,566
Nobody

363
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,735
Ryan, just stop making a scene
in front of all my friends

364
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:18,072
Kelly, I wrote you the
most amazing love poem.

365
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:22,577
But I can't even read it.
My heart couldn't handle it

366
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,745
Oh, come on... Oh, no,
no, no read it, please.

367
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,499
No, it would cause
me too much pain.

368
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,876
Read through
the pain. Be strong

369
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,836
This poem would
crush you.

370
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,006
God, Ryan, go away She found
herself a beautiful boyfriend

371
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,967
Yeah, man, he's
absolutely gorgeous

372
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,343
Please leave her alone

373
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:42,305
You see, Kelly?
Our love scares them

374
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,099
It screws up their
cookie cutter world

375
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,648
Do you guys think
he's right, though?

376
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,861
Do we live in a
cookie cutter's world?

377
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,697
Absolutely, but it's
not the point. God

378
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,785
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller.
So there's that

379
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,165
Gabe bragged about having an extra
ticket to the air show this weekend

380
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,877
and Meredith said she was interested,
and then Gabe said immediately

381
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,254
that his friend might
be taking the ticket,

382
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:17,882
so I'll keep you
posted on that.

383
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,718
Every day, I brief Nellie on
what's going on in the office.

384
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:21,886
Most of it's irrelevant

385
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,472
But a good informer doesn't
judge what's worth passing on.

386
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,641
Oh, and Andy lost
his masculinity,

387
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:27,892
so congratulations
on that.

388
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,227
What do you mean?

389
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:30,895
Erin made it clear to me
that he was unable

390
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,396
to perform sexually
last night.

391
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,523
By contrast, I went to sleep
with an erection so large

392
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,317
it was like I was
wearing no blanket at all

393
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,488
but you just
demolished him!

394
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,740
I'm little bit
jealous, actually

395
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,992
Reduced him to a mere ant

396
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,746
I just wanted to take the
man's job not his manhood.

397
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,457
Are we good?
Everybody got a jersey?

398
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,585
I still think it's weird
that we're just doing Rudy.

399
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,380
Like, not a spin on it
we're just doing it.

400
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:00,174
What about The Dead Poets
Society?\ Much better movie

401
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:03,010
What? Get your movie
rankings right, dude.

402
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,804
Why can't we just do
whatever movie we want?

403
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,180
'Cause I was gonna
do a Spartacus.

404
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,640
Oh, I wanna do
a Spartacus.

405
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,891
I am Spartacus

406
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,434
No, I am Spartacus

407
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,146
Hey, guys, we're doing Rudy, okay?
So get ready

408
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,108
Okay, I would like to invite
everyone into the conference room

409
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,277
Sure. But first,
there is something

410
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,279
No, that's not important
Conference room, now.

411
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,864
You can't
call a meeting, so

412
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,951
But I would like
to have a meeting

413
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,202
in the conference
room right now,

414
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,830
so come on, guys let's get
in the conference room.

415
00:21:30,914 --> 00:21:32,206
Thank you. Good

416
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,375
Thank you for
coming to my meeting

417
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:35,459
Appreciate it

418
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,005
Okay, if you would like to take
a seat, we can get started.

419
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,382
Can't do it because I got
to run a meeting, so

420
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,553
Wanted to talk to all of
you guys about importance

421
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:52,727
and know that each and every one
of you is vitally important

422
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:57,148
Andrew, not everyone here is important.
And the word is "impotence.'

423
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,735
Which is important
in its own way

424
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,278
so if you'd just like
to take a seat, Andy

425
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,989
Take a man's job,
but leave him his balls

426
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:07,408
Margaret Thatcher
said that, probably

427
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,910
Don't know. Don't read
Didn't see the movie.

428
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,830
So, Nellie wanted to have
a meeting on impotence.

429
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:15,124
Have to run it
as impotence is a concept

430
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,084
as foreign to me
as baba ghanoush

431
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,671
Something to do
with eggplant

432
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,007
That's all I know

433
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:27,720
This meeting is not about any
one person in particular

434
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:30,556
It is a human problem. It's
not just a human problem

435
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,850
Flounders frequently
experience impotence

436
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,643
especially when converting
from male to female

437
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,687
and then back again to male
- Really?

438
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:40,483
Nellie, does the "person" affected
by this want us to help her

439
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,859
in any way in particular?

440
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:42,985
Oh! Oh

441
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,737
It's not me. No, no

442
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:47,198
I've never had any
problem in that arena

443
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,909
And I have been
with several older men

444
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,077
How old?
How old?

445
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,495
Jinx, buy me some Coke

446
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,455
Dwight told me
about it earlier

447
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,123
Dwight?

448
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
You promised

449
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,835
Dwight couldn't
get it up for Nellie?

450
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,213
No, no, no, no, no
it's not me.

451
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,882
I'm going to prove it
right here and now.

452
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:08,219
What are you doing?
Stop that, Dwight

453
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,137
Stop that, stop it

454
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,309
Fine, it was me. I couldn't I had
a problem with Erin last night

455
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,560
Happy?

456
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,898
My mind last night
and I didn't perform

457
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,859
Okay, it happens
to plenty of guys

458
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:29,281
It's usually not followed by a giant
workplace discussion and an interview

459
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:36,539
Every guy in this room has been
touched by this affliction. Tuna?

460
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,165
D-Dog

461
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,918
Um

462
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,508
I'm terrible at math
overweight

463
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:51,887
You're in great shape A lot better
shape than I am tell you what.

464
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,683
It seems Andy is the only
one with this problem

465
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,226
Fascinating
Fascinating

466
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:00,354
what the problem is
Erin doesn't even like sex

467
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:03,023
Remember? You said it feels like
getting tackled by a skeleton

468
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:06,610
Chumbo, come on, help me out Any
problems with Little Chumbo?

469
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,028
Tip top shape

470
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,365
Stanley
No. Mmm-mmm

471
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,784
Creed, you are
1,000 years old

472
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,620
Haven't heard any complaints
Wouldn't care if I did

473
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,205
Okay, so
Actually, Andy

474
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,125
we've experienced it

475
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,209
What happened?

476
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:25,463
A couple of times.
A couple of times?

477
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,174
Jim, maybe you could tell us
about one of those times.

478
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,550
Yeah. Get it out there
- Yeah, Jim.

479
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,676
Um

480
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,433
Uh, yes, that time
that it was very late

481
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,934
Uh.

482
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:42,855
We had had sex so many times
already I was exhausted

483
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,857
Okay, stop. I could barely
see I was very drunk

484
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,567
If it makes you
feel any better

485
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,487
I never had an orgasm
until I was 42

486
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,365
And then when I did,
it lasted until I was 44

487
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,784
Forty-three was just

488
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,166
I've read, and I don't know
anything about this personally

489
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,418
but they say prostate
stimulation can help.

490
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,503
Ugh

491
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,505
This is just a This American
Life I think I heard

492
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,007
No, that's absolutely the case.
I know, right?

493
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,969
You know my rectal electro-ejaculator
is rated for bovine use only

494
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,054
but I could let you rent it

495
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:19,725
Andy, why don't you tell us about
the best erection of your life?

496
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:24,104
Or does anyone else have any remarkable
erections they'd like to share?

497
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,356
Wow. Oh What are
we talking about?

498
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,358
Toby, doesn't HR
have some rules

499
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:28,817
against talking about
this kind of stuff?

500
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:32,571
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't
do anything about anything

501
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:36,659
The most important thing to remember
is do not stress about this

502
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:39,119
Stress just makes it worse

503
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:42,498
and then you stress more
and that's a vicious spiral

504
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,584
come in today

505
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,921
Dad, don't think
of it as a demotion

506
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,507
just think of it as a
promotion to a lower level.

507
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:54,260
I don't think you have to
tell your friends anything

508
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,678
It hasn't been
decided yet.

509
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:58,597
Erin, on the phone memos you're
writing the date American style

510
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,892
Month, day, year. I prefer
it day, month, year

511
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,310
Small, bigger, biggest

512
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,395
Oh

513
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:06,522
Sexual innuendo
not intentional.

514
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,817
Shut up. Shut up, liar

515
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:14,154
"Sexual innuendo
not intentional!"

516
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,491
I am sick of
your dumb opinions

517
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,704
and if you don't like the way
that I take phone messages, here

518
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,539
Take them yourself

519
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,253
Our sex life is none
of anyone's business

520
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,840
And Andy is the manager
Not Nellie

521
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:36,135
Stop protecting me! I'm a man!
I can protect myself

522
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,761
This is misdirected anger
and I'm sorry!

523
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:38,929
I don't mean to
lash out at you

524
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,265
There's a lot coming up
right now all at once

525
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,350
Dad, go to he
I'm taller than you

526
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,311
Okay, just calm down

527
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:48,480
You are not the manager
I earned that job!

528
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,275
Chosen after Robert
was chosen and quit

529
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,235
Andy, why don't you
just take a seat?

530
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,154
Why don't you
take a seat, idiot?

531
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,699
Why don't you take
all your stupid memos?

532
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,952
And your stupid pens
and your dumb caramels

533
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,413
And your stupid face

534
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,082
And your stupid office

535
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,959
Ah! Ow

536
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,090
He does not
like that wall

537
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:21,805
Maybe we'll get sent to
anger management together.

538
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,061
That would actually be cool I'd love
for you to meet some of the guys

539
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,901
Andy, Erin
you can join us now

540
00:27:48,208 --> 00:27:49,917
What do you like
about Ryan?

541
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,629
Ryan keeps up with all
the latest technology trends

542
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,590
And he's very honest with me
about when I put on weight

543
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,469
And he has the soul
and the body of a poet

544
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:01,762
Mmm

545
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:02,930
Ravi's hotter

546
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,557
and looks are subjective,

547
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,476
but there's no
question about it

548
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,061
Yeah, but I'm just worried

549
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,270
that I'm only
attracted to Rav

550
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:13,315
because he looks exactly like this Calvin
Klein model that I'm attracted to.

551
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,692
Who cares? That's fine

552
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,277
When I was your age, I had to
choose between a Ryan and a Rav

553
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,737
and I chose the Ryan

554
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,116
And if I hadn't,
I wouldn't have my kids

555
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,119
You'd still have kids

556
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,580
Better kids. You've
got to go with Ravi.

557
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,793
Here's my advice Figure out
what your heart wants.

558
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,796
And if it's not Ravi,
change it. To Ravi

559
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,846
why this is
a dilemma for you

560
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,765
He has, like,
this je ne sais quoi.

561
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,476
He taught me that

562
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,273
Ravi makes me
incredibly happy

563
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,900
And Ryan puts me
through so much drama

564
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,277
So I guess I just
have to decide

565
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,988
which of those is
more important to me

566
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:05,075
Andy, we're going to go
with Nellie as manager

567
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,161
and put you back
on the sales team

568
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,832
we'll all laugh
about this incident.

569
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:14,376
I already think
it's kind of funny

570
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,593
No

571
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,887
Excuse me?

572
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,222
I'm saying no

573
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,517
Well, you can't say no

574
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,102
No

575
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,233
Oh. Boo

576
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:39,568
Holy crap

577
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,489
Boo! Boo! Boo to you Pam, you
are toxic You are toxic.

578
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:47,701
Kelly, I have a few things to say
to you, but please don't interrupt

579
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,287
Yeah, but you do
a lot, so just don't.

580
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,956
Thank you. I know that I
haven't always treated you

581
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,000
the way that you
for whatever reason

582
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,336
feel you deserve
to be treated

583
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,213
But I want to marry you
Kelly Kapoor

584
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:03,467
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow but some day.

585
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:04,968
And probably

586
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,638
Barf! Oh! You suck

587
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,139
What is your problem?

588
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:11,600
Hey, can we turn this back
around quickly please?

589
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,727
Can we turn this around quickly?
This is very important to me

590
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,146
Turn around
Turn around

591
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,482
Can we turn this * thing around, please?
Thank you.

592
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,400
She don't want to turn around.
Thank you

593
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,947
Kelly, I can't promise you that
we'll always stay together,

594
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,158
I can't promise you that I'll
never cheat on you Nor should I

595
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,994
Modern marriages aren't built that
way Men aren't built that way

596
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,913
There's a very interesting
article I can email to you

597
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,707
But I can tell you this,
even if the odds are 50-50

598
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,668
that we'll break up
within the week

599
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,756
Ryan

600
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,091
Will you roll
those dice with me?

601
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,094
You mean so much to me

602
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,098
But I love Ravi and I
choose him No, you don't

603
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,182
No, you don't

604
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,142
still be friends

605
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,273
Can I have a hug?

606
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:08,490
Oh. Ew

607
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,410
Well, it's good to see
Kelly is maturing.

608
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,370
Oh, God

609
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:18,375
Look, Andrew, we can discuss
the specifics of the job.

610
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:19,877
No

611
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,254
It's the apology. I really have to insist

612
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,298
No
Stop saying "no."

613
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,632
No

614
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,802
Andrew, if you say "no" one
more time you're fired.

615
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:33,390
So, is there anything
else you want to say?

616
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:35,809
No

617
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,270
I can't describe it. I just, for
the first time in a long time,

618
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,611
Here.

619
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:50,032
But you hurt your hand. I got it

620
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,868
Right now?
Yes

621
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:10,636
You're not the
least bit curious

622
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,555
to hear a poem straight
from Ryan's soul?

623
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,723
Not at all.
Can we go?

624
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,476
"Kapoor and Ka-desperate
he watches.'

625
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,187
Second line! "He is a
drifter out to sea."

626
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,691
"And when the Indian Ocean calms
one speck of white remains

627
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,861
"in waters cold
and Kelly green.'

628
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,780
It's just so dumb

629
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:36,078
But when he describes himself as
a child lost on a life raft...

630
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,791
Ryan can never know
