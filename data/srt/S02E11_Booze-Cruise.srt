1
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,635
Hey.

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:05,404
Hello.

3
00:00:05,406 --> 00:00:06,672
Jim!

4
00:00:06,674 --> 00:00:08,240
- What's up, buddy?
- This is not funny.

5
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:09,408
Why is my stuff in here?

6
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,776
Wow, that's weird.

7
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:12,611
Ooh, dollar for a stapler,
that's pretty good.

8
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:14,880
Yeah, well I'm not paying
for my own stuff, okay?

9
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:16,148
I know you did this
'cause you're friends

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,449
with the, uh,
vending machine guy.

11
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:18,450
Who Steve?

12
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,651
- Yeah, Steve.
- Oh, sorry.

13
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,588
- Or whatever his name is.
- What do I want?

14
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,790
Ooh, it's a pencil cup.

15
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:26,825
Oh, no, no, no, no.

16
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,227
That's my pencil cup.

17
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:30,362
Um, I don't think so,
I just bought it.

18
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,599
Uh, I think so, and you're
going to hand it over to me.

19
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:35,868
I love these.

20
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:37,236
Okay, fine.

21
00:00:38,304 --> 00:00:40,205
My wallet?

22
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,206
Um.

23
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,208
Oh, there it is. J1.

24
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,245
- Here, you know what?
- I don't have any...

25
00:00:46,247 --> 00:00:47,780
You can have some nickels.

26
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:55,087
5, 10.

27
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:58,590
15, 20, 25...

28
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:33,525
Hello, everyone.

29
00:01:33,527 --> 00:01:34,560
Morning, Michael.

30
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:36,195
Where are we going
this afternoon?

31
00:01:36,197 --> 00:01:37,296
Nah, ha, ha.

32
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,331
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

33
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:42,801
Last week, Michael sent out
this mysterious memo.

34
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,204
"It's time for our first
quarter camaraderie event.

35
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,539
"So pack a swimsuit,
a toothbrush,

36
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:49,408
"rubber-soled shoes,

37
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:50,542
and a ski mask."

38
00:01:50,544 --> 00:01:52,711
A ski mask and a swimsuit?

39
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,848
So that he can
have us rob a bank

40
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:58,150
and then escape
through the sewers.

41
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:00,119
And brush our teeth.

42
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,754
Yeah?

43
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,223
Michael.

44
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,091
Stanley... bo banley.

45
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:07,092
I need to know...

46
00:02:07,094 --> 00:02:08,293
Banana fanna fo fanley.

47
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,628
- What we're doing.
- Me mi mo manley.

48
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,629
You said bring a toothbrush.

49
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:11,630
Stanley.

50
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,499
Is this an overnight?

51
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:18,470
Maybe. The suspense is just
so exciting, isn't it?

52
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,539
Should my wife tell her boss
she's not coming in tomorrow?

53
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,274
Maybe, I don't know.

54
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,609
Not maybe, yes or no.

55
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:26,545
Well, no, but... okay,
don't spoil it for everybody.

56
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:27,579
All right?

57
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:32,084
But, we are going
on a booze cruise

58
00:02:32,086 --> 00:02:34,586
on Lake Wallempaupack.

59
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,823
In January.

60
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,025
It's cheaper.

61
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:41,460
This is not just another party.

62
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:44,396
This is a leadership
training exercise.

63
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,797
Right?

64
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,301
I'm going to combine elements
of fun and motivation

65
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:53,705
and education into a single,
mind-blowing experience.

66
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:56,008
It is now time to unveil

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,677
the destination of
this year's retreat.

68
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,281
We are going on a harbor cruise

69
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:04,550
of Lake Wallempaupack.

70
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,323
It's a booze cruise.

71
00:03:11,325 --> 00:03:13,091
All right.

72
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,695
I have a test for business
school tomorrow night.

73
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:19,398
Is it okay if skip the cruise
and study for that?

74
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,266
No, this is mandatory.

75
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,401
But don't worry, you know what?

76
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:23,635
You're going to learn plenty.

77
00:03:23,637 --> 00:03:27,372
This is going to turn
your life around, Ryan.

78
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,707
I'm already in business school.

79
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,008
Wait, Michael?

80
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,210
Yeah?

81
00:03:31,212 --> 00:03:32,978
Um, why did you tell us
to bring a bathing suit?

82
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
To throw you off the scent.

83
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,615
Yeah, but I bought
a bathing suit.

84
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,917
Well, just keep the tags on
and you can return it.

85
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,886
I took the tags off already.

86
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,221
Well, that's not my fault, okay?

87
00:03:42,223 --> 00:03:43,956
Just... we're not going
to pay for a bathing suit.

88
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,090
Okay.

89
00:03:45,092 --> 00:03:46,225
I know what you're all thinking.

90
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:47,993
Who is this smart little cookie?

91
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,995
Her name is Brenda...

92
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:52,097
something, and she
is from corporate.

93
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:55,400
And she is here, like you, to
learn from what I have to say.

94
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,002
I am a great
motivational speaker.

95
00:03:57,004 --> 00:04:01,673
I attended a Tony Robbins event
by the airport last year, and...

96
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:04,009
It wasn't the actual course.

97
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:05,711
You have to pay
for the actual course.

98
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:10,115
But, it talked about
the actual course.

99
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:12,851
And I've incorporated

100
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:16,255
a lot of his ideas
into my own course.

101
00:04:16,257 --> 00:04:19,491
Leader... ship.

102
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:24,463
The word ship is hidden inside
the word leadership,

103
00:04:24,465 --> 00:04:27,232
as its derivation.

104
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:32,037
So, if this office
is in fact a ship,

105
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,839
as its leader...

106
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,807
I am the captain.

107
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:36,975
But...

108
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,177
We're all in the same boat.

109
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,979
Teamwork.

110
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,816
Last year, Michael's theme was
"bowl over the competition."

111
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:48,353
So, guess where we went?

112
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:52,224
Now, on this ship
that is the office,

113
00:04:52,226 --> 00:04:54,693
what is the sales department?

114
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,362
Anyone?

115
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,931
How about the sales department
is the sails?

116
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:01,099
Yes, Daryl.

117
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,968
The sales department
makes sales.

118
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,969
Good.

119
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:04,970
Let me just explain.

120
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,139
I see the sales department

121
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,774
as the furnace.

122
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,909
- A furnace?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,144
Yeesh, how old is this ship?

124
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:13,679
How about the anchor?

125
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,080
What does the furnace do?

126
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,015
All right, let's not get
hung up on the furnace.

127
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:18,317
This just...

128
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:19,484
It's the sales...

129
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,585
I see the sales department
are down there.

130
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:21,920
They're in the engine room

131
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,856
and they are shoveling
coal into the furnace, right?

132
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,191
I mean who saw
the movie Titanic?

133
00:05:26,193 --> 00:05:28,126
They were very important
in the movie Titanic.

134
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:29,761
Who saw it?
Show of hands.

135
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,863
Not really sure what movie
you're talking about.

136
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:32,898
You sure you got
the title right?

137
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,232
Titanic.

138
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:36,335
I think you're thinking of
The Hunt for Red October.

139
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:37,336
No, I'm...

140
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,104
Leo DiCaprio, come on!

141
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:40,639
Michael stands in
the front of the boat

142
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:43,375
and says that he's king of
the world within the first hour,

143
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,944
or I give you my next paycheck.

144
00:05:45,946 --> 00:05:48,580
Michael, everyone in
the engine room drowned.

145
00:05:48,582 --> 00:05:51,516
No... thank you,
spoiler alert.

146
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,485
You saw the movie,
those of you who did.

147
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,222
They're happy down there
in the furnace room.

148
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,757
And they're dirty and grimy

149
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,925
and sweaty.

150
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,861
And they're singing
their ethnic songs.

151
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:06,398
And... actually,
that might be Warehouse.

152
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,033
What?

153
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,501
The... no...

154
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,236
No, I didn't...

155
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,604
Okay, well, the...

156
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:16,174
Okay, in a nutshell what I'm
saying is leadership.

157
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,211
We'll get... we'll talk more
about that on the boat.

158
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:20,979
Aye, aye, Captain.

159
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,252
Pam, you are Mary Ann.

160
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,387
We have...

161
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,821
The Professor and Ginger.

162
00:06:29,823 --> 00:06:31,256
Welcome aboard.

163
00:06:31,258 --> 00:06:33,392
Angela, you are Mrs. Howell.

164
00:06:33,394 --> 00:06:34,393
Lovey.

165
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:35,594
Uh, the native.

166
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:36,661
Sometimes they come
from neighboring...

167
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,697
Oh, uh, we have, uh...

168
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,699
one of the Globetrotters.

169
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:41,700
I am the Skipper.

170
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,935
And Dwight,
you will be Gilligan.

171
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,303
Cool.

172
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:46,304
Actually, I'm the Skipper.

173
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:48,039
Okay. But you could be Gilligan.

174
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh, I'd rather die.

175
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,075
Hi.
I am Michael Scott.

176
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,743
I am the Captain of this party.

177
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,011
I'm Captain Jack.

178
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:54,613
- I'm captain of the ship.
- Ahh!

179
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:56,348
I'm also captain of anyone
who sets foot on the ship.

180
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,416
Hi, welcome aboard.

181
00:06:58,317 --> 00:06:59,451
Okay.

182
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,420
In an office,
when you are ranking people,

183
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,822
manager is higher than captain.

184
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:06,358
On a boat, who knows?

185
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,627
It's nebul-ose.

186
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,262
Hey, look.

187
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:12,697
I'm king of the world!

188
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:16,535
Woo!

189
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:20,238
Woo!

190
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:22,941
Okay, all right.

191
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,242
Welcome aboard.

192
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,711
I am your captain, Captain Jack.

193
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:29,381
And I am the Regional Manager
of Dunder Mifflin,

194
00:07:29,383 --> 00:07:31,016
Michael Scott.

195
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:33,051
Welcome, welcome.

196
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,052
- Okay, so, um...
- Okay, so.

197
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,121
Please... the, uh,
life preservers.

198
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,856
They are located

199
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:39,257
underneath the seats
all along the perimeter

200
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,592
But don't worry.
of the boat.

201
00:07:40,594 --> 00:07:41,793
You are not going to be needing
life preservers tonight.

202
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:43,028
- Well, we might be, okay?
- This is just gonna be...

203
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,863
- Please let me finish, okay?
- Well...

204
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,097
Thank you.

205
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:47,466
So the Coast Guard requires

206
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,768
that I tell you where
the safety exits are.

207
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,002
Now, on this ship,
it's very easy.

208
00:07:51,004 --> 00:07:54,806
Anywhere over the side.

209
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:55,841
Not only am I
your ship's captain,

210
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:57,442
I am also your party captain!

211
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,211
Woo, we're going to get it going
here in just a few minutes...

212
00:07:59,213 --> 00:08:01,246
And I am your party captain too!

213
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,315
And you are going to put
on your dancing shoes

214
00:08:03,317 --> 00:08:04,649
later on.
Hey, Mike, Mike.

215
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:06,051
So, we are gonna...

216
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,453
- Uh, if you don't mind.
- Rock it... what?

217
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,555
Please, okay?

218
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:13,191
If the boat's a-rocking,
don't come knocking.

219
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:14,192
Michael!
Yup.

220
00:08:14,194 --> 00:08:15,760
Uh, your company employees

221
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,496
are not the only people
on the boat tonight, okay?

222
00:08:17,498 --> 00:08:18,563
We're all gonna have
a good time tonight.

223
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:20,699
Hey, hey, listen, Mike.

224
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,501
Why don't you let me
and my crew do our job?

225
00:08:22,503 --> 00:08:23,635
You just sit back...
Mm-hmm.

226
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,570
And have a good time, okay?
Okay, yup.

227
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:27,005
All right?

228
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,106
You guys,

229
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:29,441
it's like we're in high school

230
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:30,575
and we're at the cool table.

231
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,143
Right?

232
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:33,378
Yeah.

233
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,746
Kim, were you a cheerleader?

234
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:38,283
No, she was total little Miss
Artsy Fartsy in high school.

235
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:40,318
She wore the turtleneck
and everything.

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,254
That's hilarious.

237
00:08:42,256 --> 00:08:43,788
It's not hilarious, but...

238
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,956
Where'd you go to school?

239
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,291
Fisher Bohara.

240
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:48,026
"Piss la poo
cares-uh?"

241
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,928
We played you.

242
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,330
You... you really
look familiar.

243
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,432
Did you, uh... You cheered
for them, didn't you?

244
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,334
Mm, no.

245
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,270
Yes, I did.

246
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:11,516
- Having fun?
- Yeah.

247
00:09:11,518 --> 00:09:13,952
Everybody's really nice.

248
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:17,656
Good, well, that is what
Scranton is all about.

249
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,724
Not like you "New Yawkers."

250
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:20,859
When are you going
to start the, uh...

251
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:22,427
What?
The, uh, presentation?

252
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,262
Well, I already sort of
started it back at the office

253
00:09:24,264 --> 00:09:26,264
and on the dock with
the Gilligan thing.

254
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,733
So, right now, I was thinking.

255
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,734
Yes.

256
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:30,802
Okay!

257
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:32,137
Listen up,

258
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,805
all you, Dunder Mifflinites!

259
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,140
I would like to talk

260
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:36,975
to you all about

261
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,677
life preservers.

262
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:41,479
Now, one important
life preserver

263
00:09:41,481 --> 00:09:43,648
in business is IT Support.

264
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:46,484
Not now Mike,
we're doing the limbo!

265
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:48,453
That's right, partiers.

266
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:50,121
It's time to limbo,
limbo, limbo.

267
00:09:50,123 --> 00:09:52,223
So, okay.
All right!

268
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:53,291
I need a volunteer

269
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,993
to come up here
and hold my stick.

270
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,227
Huh, who's it gonna be?

271
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,729
Me.
Me, me, me.

272
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,730
Me, me, me.

273
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:00,165
Uh.

274
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,067
Usually, it's a woman.

275
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,702
I'm stronger.

276
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:04,803
Hey, I got an idea.

277
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:07,706
How would you like
to steer the ship, Dwight?

278
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:08,907
Keep us on a steady course.

279
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:11,376
Keep a sharp eye out,
I'm counting on you.

280
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,812
I was the youngest pilot
in Pan Am history.

281
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:17,182
When I was four, the pilot
let me ride in the cockpit

282
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:20,085
and fly the plane with him.

283
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:22,587
And I was four and I was great!

284
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,722
And I would have landed it,

285
00:10:23,724 --> 00:10:26,157
but my dad wanted us
to go back to our seats.

286
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,162
All right, all right.

287
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,399
That was great, now it's time
for the dance contest!

288
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:37,002
Why don't we do that after
I do my presentation and...

289
00:10:37,004 --> 00:10:38,036
Nope.

290
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,504
Dance contest!

291
00:10:39,506 --> 00:10:42,207
All right, we'll have a
motivational dance contest.

292
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,842
Hit it!

293
00:10:43,844 --> 00:10:46,211
Yeah, okay.

294
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,379
Dancing.

295
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:52,217
It is a primal art form
used in ancient times

296
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:58,023
to express yourself
with the body.

297
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,824
And communicate.

298
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,704
Sometimes you have
to take a break

299
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,972
from being the kind of boss

300
00:11:13,974 --> 00:11:15,840
that's always trying
to teach people things.

301
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:19,377
Sometimes you have to just
to be the boss of dancing.

302
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:47,372
Hey, come inside and talk to me.

303
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:48,707
I can't.

304
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,309
Do you want us
to run aground, woman?

305
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:55,947
Snorkel shots, snorkel shots!

306
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,683
Snorkel shots, snorkel shots!

307
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,051
Snorkel shots!

308
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,588
Woo! Who's next?

309
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,723
Come on, Pammy,
come on, come on!

310
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:05,790
No, I'm not doing that.

311
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:06,791
Come on!

312
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:08,126
Ay ay ay ay ay!

313
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,127
Tequila!

314
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:10,428
Woo!
Oy!

315
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,596
That's what I'm talking about.

316
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:12,597
Hey, why don't we find,

317
00:12:12,599 --> 00:12:14,232
like, a quieter place
to hang out?

318
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,601
You know what, I've just got to
wait for Daryl to do his shot.

319
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:17,602
Just a minute.

320
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:19,871
Come on, Daryl, Daryl!

321
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:21,639
It's getting kind of
rowdy down there.

322
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:22,741
Yeah.

323
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:28,346
"Daryl, Daryl, Daryl."

324
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,882
Sometimes I just don't get Roy.

325
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,084
Well.

326
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,223
I mean, I don't know.

327
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:48,666
So.

328
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:51,302
What's it like dating
a cheerleader?

329
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:57,842
Oh... um.

330
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,165
I'm cold.

331
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:32,977
So, what's this presentation
all about?

332
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,113
Ah, see, this is
of general interest.

333
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:38,283
It is about... priorities.

334
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,151
And making decisions

335
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,553
using the boat as an analogy.

336
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:43,021
What is important to you?

337
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:45,824
If the boat is sinking,
what do you save?

338
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:47,125
Women and children.

339
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,293
No, no.

340
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,495
Salesmen and profit centers.

341
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:52,163
That's a stupid analogy.

342
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,766
Oh-kay,
well, obviously,

343
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:57,535
you don't know anything
about leadership.

344
00:13:57,537 --> 00:14:00,505
Well, I was the captain of a
PC-1 Cyclone Coastal Patrol Boat

345
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,440
during Desert Storm.

346
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,909
Wow, you should be
the motivational speaker.

347
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,678
Him, oh-kay.

348
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,581
Yeah, he gives me
real responsibility, Michael.

349
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:10,982
Captain Jack delegates.

350
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:13,618
He's let me steer the ship
for the last hour.

351
00:14:15,654 --> 00:14:16,855
I'd like to be engaged.

352
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,657
How did you manage
to pull that off?

353
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,593
Um.

354
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,995
Uh, I've been engaged
for three years

355
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,997
and there's no end in sight.

356
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:29,167
So, you don't want
to ask my advice.

357
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:31,202
Suppose your office
building's on fire.

358
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,203
Jim.

359
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:33,371
Who would you save?

360
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,609
Um... let's see, uh...

361
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,945
The customer.

362
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:42,480
'Cause the customer is king.

363
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:43,948
Not what I was looking for,
but a good thought.

364
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,950
He's just sucking up.

365
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,285
When you were in the Navy,

366
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:49,721
did you, um, ever almost die?

367
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,222
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

368
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,223
And I wasn't thinking about

369
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,258
some customer.

370
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,360
I was thinking about
my first wife.

371
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,229
The day I got back
on shore, I married her.

372
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,203
You know what, I would
save the receptionist.

373
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,005
I just, wanted to clear that up.

374
00:15:10,542 --> 00:15:13,444
Hey, everybody,

375
00:15:13,446 --> 00:15:15,213
could I have your attention
for just a second?

376
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,214
Would you listen
to me for a second?

377
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,715
Um, we were up at the front

378
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,751
and we were talking about
what's really important and...

379
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,820
Pam, um...

380
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:24,155
I think enough is enough.

381
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,457
I think we should set
a date for our wedding.

382
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,992
How about June 10th?

383
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,294
- Woo!
- Come on, let's do it.

384
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:32,997
- Finally.
- Come on, baby!

385
00:15:32,999 --> 00:15:34,299
Oh, my God, congratulations!

386
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,668
Congratulations.

387
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,770
Yes!

388
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,804
Oh, my God!

389
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:40,939
I love you, baby.
Come on!

390
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,273
Woo, congratulations!

391
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,715
You know what, I don't want
to take credit for this.

392
00:15:50,717 --> 00:15:53,184
But Roy and I were just
having a conversation

393
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:58,156
about making commitments
and making choices, right?

394
00:15:58,158 --> 00:15:59,624
Did I motivate you?

395
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,292
No, it was, it was Captain Jack.

396
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,860
Well...
Captain Jack!

397
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:05,229
Could have been either one of us

398
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:07,165
because, pretty much,
we were saying the same thing.

399
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,267
Congratulations, that is great.

400
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:10,969
We gotta celebrate!

401
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,140
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
I got an idea, I got an idea.

402
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:19,110
I can marry you right now
as captain of the ship, huh?

403
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:22,880
Yes, I can marry you as Regional
Manager of Dunder Mifflin!

404
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,516
No, no, no, no, I want
my mom and dad to be there.

405
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,251
Then, I'll give you away!

406
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:29,287
No, thank you.

407
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,528
Do you think that'll ever be us?

408
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,730
No.

409
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,099
What is wrong with you?

410
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:43,801
Why did you even
bring me here tonight?

411
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,236
I don't know.

412
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:47,138
Let's break up.

413
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,607
Wh-what?

414
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:52,610
This is where old
Captain Jack drives the boat.

415
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:55,446
Wow.

416
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:56,748
Seasick?

417
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:59,183
Captain Jack says
you should look at the moon.

418
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,718
Captain Jack's a fart face.

419
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,058
I'm on medication.

420
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,459
Really, what?

421
00:17:08,461 --> 00:17:09,861
Vomicillin.

422
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:15,767
Okay, all right,
it's time to be bossy.

423
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:17,969
Time to motivate,
let's blow some minds here.

424
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,071
Okay, guys, guys, guys, cool it.

425
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:21,172
Everybody.

426
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:22,640
Dunder Mifflin
and Scranton employees.

427
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:24,342
Brenda.

428
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:26,811
I have some very, very urgent
news I need to tell everybody.

429
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28,613
Right now, listen up.

430
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:31,416
The ship... is sinking.

431
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,683
Okay?

432
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,652
We're going down, right now.

433
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:37,655
Just wrap your heads around
the reality of that.

434
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,490
What?

435
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,691
Shh, please, everybody,
it's my turn now, okay?

436
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,393
Captain Jack is gone.

437
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,896
In five minutes,
this ship is going to be

438
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,264
at the bottom of the lake.

439
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,934
And there aren't enough spaces
on the lifeboats.

440
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,769
Who are we going to save?

441
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,504
- Do we save sales?
- No, no!

442
00:17:53,506 --> 00:17:55,540
Do we save customer service?

443
00:17:55,542 --> 00:17:57,075
Do we save accounting?

444
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,410
This is a business
scenario, right?

445
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,878
Hey, hey!

446
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,146
It's a scary...

447
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,714
- What the hell's going on here?
- It's a predicament.

448
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,782
Get outta here, what the...

449
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,350
And it's something that
each and every one of us

450
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,919
have to think about.

451
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,655
I'm in the brig, see?

452
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:15,259
Boat size corporate friendly,
as advertised.

453
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:16,961
What is the deal with
the guy jumping overboard?

454
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,262
What was...

455
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,933
If he had just waited
and heard what I had to say,

456
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:24,735
he would be motivated
right now and not all wet.

457
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,385
Somebody there?

458
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:45,623
What happened to you?

459
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:49,994
Captain Jack
has a problem with authority.

460
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:53,631
Oh, right, 'cause you announced
that his ship was sinking?

461
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:56,901
Yeah.
He just totally lost it.

462
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,570
If you ask me,
he caused the panic.

463
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,744
What a night.

464
00:19:06,746 --> 00:19:08,980
Well, it was nice for you.
Your friend got engaged.

465
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:10,148
She was always engaged.

466
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,150
Roy said the first one
didn't count.

467
00:19:12,152 --> 00:19:15,453
That's... great.

468
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:20,992
To tell you the truth, I...

469
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:23,194
used to have
a big thing for Pam.

470
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,629
So.

471
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:26,397
Really, you're kidding me.

472
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,368
Y-you and Pam?

473
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,737
Wow.

474
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:35,106
I would have never...
put you two together.

475
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:36,974
You really hid it well, God!

476
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:40,278
I usually have a radar
for stuff like that.

477
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,483
You know, I made out with Jan.

478
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:47,485
Yeah, I know.
Yeah, yup.

479
00:19:47,487 --> 00:19:49,187
Well, Pam is cute.

480
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,721
Yeah.

481
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,824
She's really funny and...

482
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:57,094
She's warm and she's just...

483
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:59,830
Anyway.

484
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:03,834
Well, if you like her so much,
uh, don't give up.

485
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:07,905
She's engaged.

486
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:08,906
Pfft... BFD!

487
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,141
Engaged ain't married.

488
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,279
Huh.

489
00:20:15,281 --> 00:20:17,615
Never, ever, ever give up.

490
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,489
Don't worry, Michael.

491
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:28,059
I'm taking us to shore!

492
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,294
It's a fake wheel, dummy!
