1
00:00:02,794 --> 00:00:04,086
Oh, for god's sake

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,216
Planking is a very stupid
and dangerous trend

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,427
Basically you lie like
a plank in weird places

4
00:00:12,137 --> 00:00:13,178
That's it.

5
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:14,805
Sometimes you get run over

6
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:16,724
Welcome to the Internet

7
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:19,601
Planking is one of
those things where

8
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,271
hey, you either
get it or you don't

9
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,442
And I don't. But I am so
excited to be a part of it.

10
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,863
After you
my good sir

11
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:31,947
No, I insist

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,741
The search committee
finally decided,

13
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:35,534
after a lot of deliberation

14
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:38,954
on Robert California
for the manager position

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,958
Who took one look
around and left.

16
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:47,838
He drove down to Florida and
convinced Jo to make him C.E.O

17
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,135
C.E.O. Her own job

18
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,095
He talked her
out of her own job

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,014
and I don't really know
how someone does that

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,309
but anyway then the
position was his to fill

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,561
and he chose

22
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,235
It's unbelievable

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,072
True. I may have
been tee second choice,

24
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,365
but I was the first
choice's first choice.

25
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,742
And about Dwight,

26
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,745
have some resentment
about not getting the job

27
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,163
so I sat him down
and we had a talk

28
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:24,083
And I told him, "I need a
really strong number two

29
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,417
"I want you to
be my enforcer.'

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,544
Smart, right?
Very smart

31
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:31,673
This has got to stop

32
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,843
Hey! Kevin

33
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,932
Yeah, at first I was
really disappointed

34
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,810
But I've got a great daily
routine going right now

35
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,603
I've upped my karate
to eight times a week.

36
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,730
I've added boxing at
lunches and on weekends,

37
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:49,900
I do kick-boxing three times a
week, Krav Maga four times a week,

38
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:52,402
an hour of meditation
every morning at sunrise,

39
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:54,029
and again at sunset.

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:57,032
So yeah
I'm doing great

41
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,243
I'm going to need
some help. Pam?

42
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,790
Oh, yeah. Pregnant

43
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,792
Right here.
Little Michael Scott

44
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,169
Nope. I told you I
don't like that joke

45
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:10,963
It is a boy.
We found out early

46
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,674
Much different
the second time around

47
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:15,801
And I have to say
it is nice not being

48
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,594
the only pregnant
woman in the office

49
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,474
Look, it's "little
pregs" and "big pregs."

50
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,476
Wait, when did we start
calling each other

51
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,146
Isn't it amazing the
difference in our sizes?

52
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,981
Well, I am a few
months ahead of you

53
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,733
I'm having a child with
my husband the senator

54
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:36,405
And Pam is having a child
with Jim The great salesman

55
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,073
Hoist him aloft

56
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,742
Come on, Darryl, lift
Lift, Darryl

57
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,119
Come on, man

58
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,622
Yeah, I wanted the manager job,
but I got something much better

59
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,209
This soda

60
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,378
This is mine

61
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,258
It might be easier if you take a
deep breath lift from the knees,

62
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,885
and shove it
up your butt

63
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,388
a new thing this summer

64
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:03,932
I act like I'm telling
someone how to do something.

65
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,352
A long description
and then I say...

66
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,146
And shove it up your butt

67
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,443
It's stupid,
but it's my thing now

68
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,820
No one should be
planking at all.

69
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,447
Thank you. Yes

70
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,534
Dwight my enforcer, my number
two can you take care of this?

71
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:23,827
Say no more

72
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,966
Kids, don't try planking
it's dangerous.

73
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,303
Especially with me around

74
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,502
Are you watching
that commercial again?

75
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:18,966
Why do you keep watching it if you
know it's just going to make you cry?

76
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,927
Because everything makes me
cry so what's the difference?

77
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,848
This dog he just wants
to protect his bone

78
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,934
He's got a bank vault
That's a start.

79
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:29,977
Not enough, though

80
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,061
All right

81
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:39,778
The new C.E.O. works out of the
conference room about half the time

82
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:44,032
but whenever he takes a break he does
these weird walks around the office.

83
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,243
And you never know who
he's going to zero in on

84
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,495
for these really
intense small talks

85
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,872
You just hope
it's not you.

86
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,335
And yet you hope it is
you, too It's strange

87
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,719
Here we go.
Hello

88
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,888
Robert California.
Let's have a conversation

89
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,807
Describe your day so far

90
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,600
Well, I woke up and

91
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,020
When you recount your day,
never say you woke up

92
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,313
It's a waste of your time

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:17,399
That's how every day has begun for
everyone since the dawn of man.

94
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,818
Very smart
Very smart

95
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:25,073
Suddenly, I was awake
and I...

96
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:30,787
Hey, Robert We have that 9:30 A.M.
casual chit chat scheduled

97
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,374
I emailed you about it last eight
to confirm. And again this morning

98
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,460
First item on the agenda
can I get everyone

99
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,503
an extra long
Columbus Day weekend?

100
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,922
Item number two,
connect with the guy

101
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:44,301
Robert California,
what does he think of me?

102
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,761
Don't know
Super care.

103
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,556
Number three, time permitting
we lost our biggest client.

104
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,905
Pam. Pam
Past! Pam.

105
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,171
Jim

106
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,434
Can I call you right back?
Thank you very much.

107
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:36,770
Okay

108
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,233
What is this?

109
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,405
The Friday before
Columbus Day, thoughts?

110
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,614
What are your thoughts?

111
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,032
Just making chit-chat

112
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,370
Kind of a medium year
for women's soccer, no?

113
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,541
What are you looking at?

114
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,709
It's nothing

115
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,920
It can't be nothing
Yeah, it can't be nothing.

116
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,631
It's just a list of our names
split into two columns

117
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,174
What?

118
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,844
Okay, just wait one second all right?
I will copy it

119
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,179
Do you have a pen?
No

120
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,305
No

121
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,308
Okay. Um, I'll take
a photo of it.

122
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,726
Dwight, can you
throw me my phone?

123
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:22,190
Nice catch

124
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,359
If he comes out
distract him.

125
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,445
We need a warning signal

126
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,238
We don't need
a warning signal, Kevin

127
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,448
We can see him right there.
- We do.

128
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,532
Don't need a...

129
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:33,785
Warning! Warning Warning!
Warning! Warning

130
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,620
Phyllis!
Phyllis

131
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:38,915
You okay?

132
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,711
You okay?
Yeah. Yeah.

133
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,212
One, two, three

134
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,338
Thanks, guys

135
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,095
Okay. Which side
of the list am I on?

136
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,222
Left
Yes

137
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,558
Why are you...
How do you know?

138
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,936
Really great
list of names, guys

139
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,355
Thank you so much
Good work.

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,150
No, actually, that was
in Robert's notebook.

141
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,235
He left it at reception
and we photocopied it

142
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:08,653
Oh

143
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:11,698
Okay. I don't want
any part of this.

144
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,159
Maybe it's the list of people
he's going to fire.

145
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,661
Okay.
It's not that, Pam

146
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:18,997
You know I was
thinking it reminds me

147
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,540
of those lists
Dwight used to make

148
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,417
This is if we were a
on a cruise ship

149
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,252
and had to divide
into life boats.

150
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:25,879
And this is if we
were on a cruise ship

151
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,714
and had to divide
into life rafts.

152
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,260
Here's something "Who would eat
who in an Alive situation?'

153
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,682
No. That can't be it

154
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,725
I gotta say

155
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,811
it kind of seems like the left
side is the side to be on

156
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,856
Me, Jim, Dwight, Darryl
no offense, Pam.

157
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,608
Excuse me?

158
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,652
Shh. Pam, come on Don't
be such a right-sider.

159
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,781
Did you guys figure it out?
We couldn't crack it

160
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,450
Go in there, just ask
the man what it means

161
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,746
He'll know that we looked
at his private notebook

162
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,290
Come on Just say you saw
the list by accident

163
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,709
I'm already working on this
Columbus Day thing for you guys

164
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,212
And it's starting
to stack up.

165
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,880
It feels like a lot
One thing at a time

166
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,925
Yeah, that's all you had to do
today is ask about Columbus Day?

167
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,391
Yes. For god's sake
Andy, yes. Come in.

168
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:23,937
What's up?

169
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,439
Weird thing.
Totally awkward

170
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,068
But you left your notebook
on the reception desk.

171
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:31,194
Great. Thank you

172
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,947
And it was open

173
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:37,117
and people saw this

174
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,160
and they're just kind of
going nuts and, like...

175
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,245
What is this?

176
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,288
...wondering what it is

177
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,415
It's a photocopy
from your notebook

178
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:47,127
You read my notebook? And
photocopied it and distributed it?

179
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:53,633
No. They did. And they asked
me to ask you about it

180
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,677
Please

181
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,014
Oh

182
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,057
Here's what it is
it's a doodle.

183
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,601
What?

184
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,021
Some people doodle at work
when they let their mind run

185
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,647
They draw houses, penises

186
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,734
funny how the houses
are always colonials

187
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:12,527
and the penises are
always circumcised

188
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,571
Don't you think?

189
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:19,200
Well, I doodle too but I'm not an
artist so I draw words and lists

190
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:23,705
That is fascinating

191
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,915
And by the way
I am so glad I asked

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,585
People were just sort of...
Did you just move my name?

193
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,463
Might as well have
been sketching a cube

194
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,054
Okay, Robert's in the annex
everybody think quick

195
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,472
What do these
groups have in common?

196
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,474
Maybe we're supposed to do
it with people in our group.

197
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:43,850
That's not it

198
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,101
People in
the other group

199
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,519
Mmm. Still wrong

200
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,356
Stanley, you do puzzles
all day What do we got?

201
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,650
Well, you take the first
letter from each name

202
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,110
assign it a number
add them all up,

203
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,862
and shove it up your butt

204
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,323
Thank you, a little
much needed comic relief

205
00:10:58,407 --> 00:11:00,700
But we really need to
figure this out, guys

206
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,537
It's alphabetical

207
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,457
No, it's not

208
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,541
Here's how we find out

209
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,293
Let's line up and
compare the lines

210
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,628
see if we learn
anything, okay?

211
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,089
Left-siders over here
right-siders line up over here,

212
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,173
face each other

213
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,676
Match up by height
and relative weight

214
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:21,137
Let's just size
each other up here

215
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,723
And left side of the list

216
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,767
attack

217
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,936
Wait, wait, wait,
stop, stop!

218
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,604
Will you stop?

219
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,856
Dwight

220
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,108
Don't do it

221
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:34,943
What are you doing?
Stop!

222
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:38,113
Warning! Warning! Warning

223
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:47,997
I'd like to invite the following
people to join me for lunch.

224
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,500
Jim, Dwight

225
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,253
Angela, Darryl

226
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,799
Kevin, Toby
Phyllis, Oscar

227
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,429
That's great.
Let's do this, guys

228
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,267
All right. Well,
I will see you in a bit

229
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:12,230
Hey, it's nothing
all right?

230
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:13,732
I'll text you
when we get there

231
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,775
I'll let you know
what's going on Okay

232
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,652
No. No dog video

233
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,154
Okay
Okay.

234
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,989
See you, guys

235
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,369
Well, we should a
be really excited about

236
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:30,206
our very own pizza party

237
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,253
Pizza party Pizza party.
Pizza party.

238
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:38,548
Jim, your daughter Cecelia what
does she think of the Street?

239
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:40,133
The street?

240
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,342
Sesame Street.

241
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,428
Oh. I didn't know
anybody called it

242
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:44,763
She likes it a lot

243
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,389
She loves Elmo

244
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,767
Elmo, God save us the Elmo era

245
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:49,851
Right?

246
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,603
Sesame Street was
created to reflect

247
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,271
the environment of
the children watching it

248
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,982
Complete self
absorption of Elmo

249
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,984
is brilliantly
reflective of our time

250
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,154
Ours is a cultural ghetto
Wouldn't you agree?

251
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:04,741
Yeah. She does like Elmo

252
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,994
Cultural ghetto?
Totally agree

253
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,162
Completely

254
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,706
Apt. Apt analysis, Robert

255
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,543
The thing that I like about
Elmo is the tickling

256
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,632
I don't know
I was in the wrong...

257
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,384
I'm... I'm sorry

258
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,346
Just picture me back there.
I was never here

259
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,560
Great group
Pizza party.

260
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,728
How is this a pizza party?

261
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,021
Well, why don't you
ask me again

262
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,272
when the five pizzas
get here?

263
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,440
Yeah, well,
that's just pizza

264
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,651
You need at least one other
element for it to be a party.

265
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,486
Okay. Have you guys
ever had margarita pizza?

266
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:42,570
What's that?

267
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,741
Fresh tomato with a dollop
of mozzarella cheese.

268
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,992
That's pizza

269
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,953
That's regular pizza

270
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:52,664
You know, I fee comfortable enough
now to ask you this question,

271
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:55,333
what made you
pick this group?

272
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,252
I just think
you guys are winners

273
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,503
and I wanted to
have lunch with you

274
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,671
Okay

275
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:00,839
Aw.

276
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,049
What about the other guys?

277
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,677
Losers? Come on.
Oh, I don't know

278
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,178
Come on. Come on

279
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,930
I guess I think
they're losers.

280
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,432
I knew it

281
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:12,517
Yes

282
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,060
Probably shouldn't
have said that

283
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,687
Whoo-hoo

284
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,815
Ah-ha! Their interpretation
of margherita pizza

285
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,776
Fans of classic pizza
will be psyched.

286
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,655
A text from Jim

287
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,449
"This is getting very weird
Will explain later."

288
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,330
Text from Kevin

289
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:35,540
"Suck it, losers.'

290
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,839
RYAN Okay, not to point out
the glaringly obvious,

291
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,258
but doesn't the fact
that lama in this group

292
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,635
make anyone feel just
a little bit better?

293
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,555
Oh, this crust is sharp

294
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,310
and sort of funny

295
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,229
and I could do those
cute little cartoons

296
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,816
and everyone who came
through here was like,

297
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,985
"Who's that receptionist? I like her."

298
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,529
Now I'm just a fat mom

299
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,034
Yeah, and you take one look at
me and you're like, "Oh, loser."

300
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,660
Come here, Pam

301
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,246
Chins up, okay?

302
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:17,832
Bad joke

303
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,543
Look around this room

304
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,171
Does this look like a group of losers?
Seriously.

305
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:31,763
Oh, god

306
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,768
Oh, hey, guys
we had so much fun.

307
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,186
We had marguerite pizza

308
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,938
We all hung out and got
to know each other better

309
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:40,980
How was your lunch?

310
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,982
It was excellent.
Good times

311
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,233
Yeah?
Yeah.

312
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,235
Oh, we did.
It was the best time

313
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,948
And you know what? Now it's
over back to work, everyone

314
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,033
You too, Andy

315
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:53,660
I knew it.

316
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:57,789
That everyone
was wrong about me.

317
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:03,294
My parents, my teachers, my
friends the doctors, everyone.

318
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,214
Well, that was
certainly an odd lunch

319
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,719
Is everything all right?

320
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,013
Yeah, I'm fine

321
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,853
Just take the
casserole out of the

322
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:21,980
Loser

323
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,315
Take it out of the refrigerator,
put it in the oven

324
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,068
It'll be fine Just leave
it in for 20 minutes

325
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,320
Loser

326
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,697
When I was a salesman
I could just be like,

327
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:34,659
"Not my job, not my prob I'm going
to the warehouse to polish my knob."

328
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:37,078
Metaphorically, of course

329
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,249
But now,
it is my job and my prob

330
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:43,084
Hi, Robert

331
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,921
Can you come out here, please?
It's really important.

332
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,344
Clarify something

333
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,724
Some people here
are under the misconception

334
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:02,186
that some people
may be considered

335
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:04,313
let's say top tier

336
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:07,150
and others would
be second tier.

337
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,361
Thank you. Great

338
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,114
I said winners and losers Is
that what you're talking about?

339
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,869
Oh, that might That actually
might be what I'm thinking of.

340
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,620
Can you clarify that?

341
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,123
Let me tell you some
things I find productive

342
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,960
Positive reinforcement

343
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,296
negative reinforcement

344
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:29,922
Honesty

345
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,884
I'll tell you some things
I find unproductive

346
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,345
Constantly worrying
about where you stand

347
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,556
based on
inscrutable social clues

348
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,185
and then inevitably reframing
it a in a reassuring way

349
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,728
so that you can get
to sleep at night.

350
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,606
No, I do not
believe in that at all

351
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,650
If I invited you to lunch
I think you're a winner

352
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,110
If I didn't, I don't

353
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,945
But I just met you all

354
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,406
Life is long,
opinions change

355
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:59,786
Winners, prove me right
Losers, prove me wrong

356
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,462
Well, I guess
that's that

357
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,546
No

358
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,550
No. No

359
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,262
Andy, don't go in there

360
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,889
I'm going in there

361
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,148
I know that every time I talk to
you things just seem to get worse

362
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,777
But you don't know
these people, and I do

363
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,530
And if I let you work
with faulty information

364
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:38,032
well then I'm not doing my
job as regional manager.

365
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,037
So, please take this pen
and change your list.

366
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,997
I'm not going to
change my list, Andy

367
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,958
And I don't use
ballpoint pens.

368
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:51,546
Well, then I w
make a new list for you

369
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:59,804
Stanley, you may think
he's a lazy grump

370
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,723
but did you know that he has the
most consistently high sales numbers

371
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,142
of anyone in this office?

372
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,144
And you may think
he's hard to love

373
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,812
but did you know
that he's in not one

374
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,064
but two long-term
romantic relationships?

375
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,401
About the sales figures

376
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,695
Meredith Palmer,
supplier relations

377
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:18,823
The word "no,"
not even in her vocabulary

378
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,199
And just to show you
that I'm being fair,

379
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,492
you had Gabe in
the loser column

380
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,414
Good call

381
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:27,999
Pam

382
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:33,921
easily the most creative and kind
person I have ever worked with.

383
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,007
Jim, shut the door
This is just gross.

384
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,091
Shh

385
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,595
Erin Hannon, the receptionist
and my closest confidant

386
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,680
A winner if
there ever was one

387
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,896
Are we done?

388
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:50,980
Yes

389
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,231
No

390
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,066
The Friday
before Columbus Day

391
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:55,610
we're going to
take a half-day

392
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,612
So that everyone can get a
jump on the long weekend.

393
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,615
You want a three-and-a-half
day weekend for Columbus Day?

394
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,742
Yes, I do

395
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,870
And you are aware that
Columbus and his legions

396
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,624
committed genocide against an entire
civilization of Native Americans?

397
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,804
Hey, guys

398
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,059
so Columbus Day, we got
that half-day on Friday

399
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,852
We get that every year

400
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:32,313
Well, you got it
this year, too.

401
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,442
Good night, Andy
Good night.

402
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,777
Bye

403
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,780
Good night, Andy

404
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,618
Good night

405
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,786
Night

406
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,466
All right, I'm going
to go warm up the car

407
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:01,968
Okay
Okay.

408
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,846
You dropped something. Jim?

409
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,725
Okay, I know I've been
crying easily today, but

410
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,939
I mean, that's just
pretty killer, right?

411
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,110
I mean,
maybe it's stupid

412
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,404
No

413
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,740
It's wonderful

414
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,575
I'm going to frame it
