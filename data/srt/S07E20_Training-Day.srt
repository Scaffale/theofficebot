1
00:00:02,202 --> 00:00:03,534
MICHAEL:
Kahlua sombrero, please.

2
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,902
All right.
So just you tonight?

3
00:00:05,072 --> 00:00:08,133
Actually,
I'm meeting somebody,
but I'm a little bit early.

4
00:00:08,775 --> 00:00:12,007
Leaving my company
after 19 years.

5
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,473
I'll drink to that.

6
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:15,915
I'm starting at
a company this week.

7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,315
Oh, really?

8
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:18,779
To beginnings and endings.

9
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:23,017
And to middles.
The unsung heroes.
And to moms.

10
00:00:23,557 --> 00:00:24,616
The moms of the troops.

11
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,850
Mmm.

12
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,793
Do not tell my fiancÃ©e
I'm drinking on a Wednesday.

13
00:00:28,896 --> 00:00:30,524
I won't.

14
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:32,427
I don't know her.

15
00:00:32,499 --> 00:00:33,592
Moving out to the 'burbs.

16
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:36,136
Actually, I'm moving
further than the 'burbs.
Moving to Colorado.

17
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,227
Colorado?
Yeah.

18
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:38,863
Sunshine State.
Yep.

19
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:39,963
Don't mess with Colorado.

20
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,030
No, don't.

21
00:00:41,441 --> 00:00:42,534
Doing some skiing?

22
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,737
No, no.
I don't want to end up
like Sonny Bobo.

23
00:00:45,112 --> 00:00:48,048
Well, that's just good
sense right there, yeah.

24
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:50,675
Everyone I know
who skis is dead.

25
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:54,111
You know what?
I would like to
try the luge, though.

26
00:00:54,187 --> 00:00:56,247
Try it once, you're hooked.

27
00:00:56,323 --> 00:00:58,189
That's my guess.
That's what I've heard.

28
00:00:58,258 --> 00:00:59,487
I'm an Olympics nut.

29
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,688
Oh, yeah? Me, too.
Summer or winter?

30
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,097
Summer.
Summer.

31
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:06,356
Knuckle. Actually,

32
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,598
I've got to come
around and give you...
Yeah, come on.

33
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:11,434
You know, it's funny.
I actually tried

34
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,599
to get an animal
Olympics going.

35
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,142
Really? What happened?

36
00:01:15,876 --> 00:01:17,845
You know, life happened.

37
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,042
What are you gonna miss
most about Scranton?

38
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:24,312
Oh. Wow. The mountains,
where things are.
Mmm-hmm.

39
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:26,884
That's the way it goes.

40
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:29,320
Man, he is late.

41
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:30,823
I'm gonna call him.
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

42
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:32,291
No, no.

43
00:01:32,359 --> 00:01:34,021
Where is this guy?

44
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,263
Excuse me.

45
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,466
Hello?
This is Michael Scott.

46
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,199
Yes, yes.
Hi.

47
00:01:45,272 --> 00:01:46,331
You running late?

48
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:49,035
No, I'm here.
I'm at the bar.

49
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,099
I'm at the bar, too.

50
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,146
You are? What bar?

51
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:57,707
I'm at the bar,
the bar that's located
in the lobby of the hotel.

52
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,044
I do not see you.

53
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,143
How long have you...

54
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,315
I've been here about, gosh,
over half an hour.

55
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,619
Okay, yeah, me, too.

56
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,756
Sorry.
Sorry.

57
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,919
What are you wearing?

58
00:02:07,995 --> 00:02:10,521
I'm wearing
a gray suit, red tie.

59
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,525
Are we both at
the right place?

60
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,027
Which place...

61
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,195
I hear your voice.

62
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,703
I hear your...
I see your lips moving.

63
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,034
I hear your voice

64
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:23,305
in the phone.
And that's... Man!
And...

65
00:02:25,212 --> 00:02:26,236
Michael Scott.

66
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,303
Deangelo Vickers.

67
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:28,644
Wow.

68
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,684
That is insane.

69
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,550
"That is insane" is right.
That's the right term.

70
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,385
Bartender,
let's get some vodka
up in this cranberry

71
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,822
and one for my friend.

72
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,052
Here we go. Ready?

73
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,185
I am ready.

74
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,421
All right, here we go.

75
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,034
Well, this is it.
What do you think?

76
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:51,936
She'll do.
Oh, she'll do just fine.

77
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,637
I am very much
looking forward
to tomorrow. It is...

78
00:02:58,745 --> 00:03:00,771
It feels like
the culmination of
a lot of hard work,

79
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:02,816
a lot of good fortune and...

80
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,383


81
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:11,315
We should write
a movie or something.
I'm serious.

82
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,174
Michael is leaving.

83
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:38,480
And apparently
they already hired
a new manager.

84
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:41,784
And we're meeting him today.
It's a lot to process.

85
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,719
Paperwork-wise.

86
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:54,132
Nope, it's not Ashton Kutcher.
It's Kevin Malone.

87
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:57,330
Equally handsome,
equally smart.

88
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,901
Okay, everyone,
as you know,

89
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,844
one of my favorite things
is fanfare for its own sake.

90
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,143
So without further ado,

91
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:10,207
let's all start clapping.

92
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,516
Presenting Deangelo Vickers!

93
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,286
Hi. Hello.

94
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,027
MICHAEL: Come on out!

95
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,492
Hello. Hey.
How are you, sir?

96
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:29,934
I'm well, sir,
how are you?

97
00:04:30,003 --> 00:04:33,030
Uh, can I just say
I am so excited
to be working here.

98
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:37,838
Little bit about myself,
I love the American southwest,
for starters.

99
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,641
You may call them
Arizona, New Mexico,
Nevada, Utah.

100
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,042
I call them heaven.

101
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:46,052
I have a peanut allergy,
something I live with.

102
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,486
It's a part of me.
I've learned to cope
with it. What else?

103
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:53,823
I'm just as
comfortable at a ball game
as I am at the opera.

104
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:55,451
I was a...

105
00:04:55,529 --> 00:04:58,465
Did I want to be
made manager? Sure.

106
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:01,058
A great opportunity
squandered? Absolutely.

107
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,797
A crushing blow? Yes.

108
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:06,335
Will I get over it?

109
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:07,430
Mmm...

110
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,775
No.

111
00:05:09,843 --> 00:05:12,540
But life goes on.
Not for me.

112
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,010
I'll get that,
you guys. Don't...

113
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,313
No, I'll help you. Here.

114
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,480
You know, it's just...

115
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,120
You know...

116
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,657
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

117
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,560
Have we met before?

118
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:33,128
No, not officially.
I saw you coming out
of the bathroom earlier.

119
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,634
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go back to my cave.

120
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:38,501
Okay.
It was really
great meeting you.

121
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,171
And that is what
they call a meet cute.

122
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:46,409
So we talked for
like 20 minutes,

123
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,209
no clue it's Deangelo
the whole time.

124
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,677
It's kind of embarrassing.

125
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,877
No, no.

126
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,177
Yeah, that story
makes you sound stupid.

127
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:58,282
I happen to like
the hilarious high jinks
that I get myself into.

128
00:05:58,758 --> 00:05:59,919
There he is, there he is.

129
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,623
Deangelo, I was just
telling them about last night
when we met.

130
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:05,894
Remember that?

131
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,958
That was crazy.
That was crazy.

132
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,469
Let's see,
where's my replacement?

133
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:13,339
Where's the guy
I'm replacing?
I don't know.

134
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,272
Why don't I look
to my left?
I know.

135
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:16,810
He's sitting right there.
I know.

136
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,742
Well, that's what I was
just saying. That's...

137
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:24,682
That exact situation
is why I always carry
around a couple of these.

138
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:26,117
Just in case,
'cause, you know,

139
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,484
sometimes you need
to ID yourself.

140
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,316
Office funny guy.

141
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,258
Always glad to have
an office funny guy around.

142
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:35,355
ANDY: <i>I wasn't even</i>
<i>trying to make a joke.</i>

143
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,926
I guess I've always
been sort of quirky,
offbeat, a little twisted.

144
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,596
This is Jim and Pam,
a.k.a. Jap.

145
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:49,540
What started as an affair
has blossomed into
a family before our eyes.

146
00:06:49,643 --> 00:06:51,509
Well, it wasn't...
It wasn't an affair.
Yes, it was.

147
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,206
But, no,
but we are a family.

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,543
We made that.

149
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:55,843
Cecelia.
DEANGELO: Oh!

150
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,279
Congratulations.
Thank you.

151
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,410
I have four kids
of my own.

152
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:00,545
Really?
Yeah.

153
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,557
Oh, my gosh,
well, we just have the one,
but she poops for four.

154
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:05,881
Uh-oh.

155
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,952
Someone started off
on a good foot
with the new boss.

156
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,498
Yeah, they don't
ever talk about careers
that were made

157
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,466
because of unplanned
pregnancies. So...

158
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:16,696
Psst. Thanks for
meeting me.

159
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:17,794
Are you kidding?

160
00:07:17,871 --> 00:07:19,635
I would come anywhere
to see a turtle.
Yeah.

161
00:07:19,706 --> 00:07:20,799
Where'd you find him?

162
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,305
There's no turtle, Michael.
I just wanted to get
you here.

163
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,345
You know me
very well, Dwight.

164
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,609
That's because I'm your
right-hand man, Michael.

165
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,480
But I can't do it.
I can't do it again.

166
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,382
I can't be a right-hand man
to a whole new guy.

167
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,081
Now, I'm gonna
have to go online
and look at turtles

168
00:07:35,155 --> 00:07:36,521
or else I'm gonna
be off the whole day.

169
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:38,683
I want to be manager.

170
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:43,059
I just don't understand
why I wasn't even
interviewed for the job.

171
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,153
I mean, what's wrong?

172
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:47,132
I'm totally qualified.
You were pushing for me.

173
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,896
That apple looks delish.

174
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,671
I do a lot of
portion control.

175
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,332
Try to keep my daily
caloric intake
under 1,200.

176
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,535
Deangelo, you're going
to starve to death.

177
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,576
So you decided
to have an orgy
and not invite me?

178
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,116
Come on. I call middle.

179
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,919
That's cool that you
like the southwest.

180
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,819
It's one of my
favorite regions.

181
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,049
"It's one of my
favorite regions."

182
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,922
Did I just sound
totally lame?

183
00:08:13,727 --> 00:08:14,786
Oh.

184
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,263
I sounded good.

185
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:20,901
I love the desert.
It's one of my
favorite ecosystems.

186
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,129
Here's the great thing
about the southwest,

187
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:25,866
there is so much
more than desert.

188
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,135
Along the north rim
of the Grand Canyon

189
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,370
is a forest as lush
as you've ever seen.

190
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,603
Burned. It's lush, dummy.

191
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:36,239
Hey, Deangelo,
what do you think
about bald people?

192
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,746
I hate them.

193
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,310
Deangelo, I forget,
did you mention
you like politics?

194
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,378
I did not.

195
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,892
Because I was thinking,
you should meet my boyfriend.
He's a state senator.

196
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,327
I really think the two
of you would hit it off.
He's a great person to know.

197
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,226
Sounds very interesting,
thank you.

198
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,492
ANGELA: Mmm-hmm.

199
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:56,729
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin.
Okay, let me transfer you.

200
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,064
Why do you use your name
when you answer the phone?

201
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,302
Oh, that's how Pam does it.
I just copy her.

202
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,367
She's sort of
a living legend.

203
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:07,106
Try it without
using your name.

204
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,415
Dunder Mifflin. This is.

205
00:09:11,084 --> 00:09:12,382
Oh, yeah, I like it.

206
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,921
Dunder Mifflin.
How may I assist you?

207
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:16,515
Oh. "Assist."

208
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:17,613
I sort of like
the old way.

209
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,185
I just prefer it
without the name.

210
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:23,162
And I thought...
Okay. No, no, no.

211
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,095
I've got to start doing
some managing at
some point, right?

212
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,134
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
But if it's not a big deal,

213
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,725
we should just
do the old way.
And it really isn't.

214
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:30,498
Okay. That good?
ERIN: Yeah, okay, good.

215
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,471
Well, I'd like to
change it, actually.

216
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:34,701
MICHAEL: Well,
you know, whatever...

217
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,333
Yeah.
Whatever you think
would work.

218
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,938
What do you...
Yeah.

219
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:39,676
I think a change
would be nice.

220
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,410
You could do the old
way or the, you know...
Whichever one you want to do.

221
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,815
Mmm-hmm.

222
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,816
DEANGELO:
Change it.

223
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,460
I'm so sorry.

224
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:14,305
Hey, funny guy.
I have a little
midday lull here.

225
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,673
Make me laugh. Huh?
What do you got?

226
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,176
I can't even look
at you.

227
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,310
Here we go.

228
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:21,210
Okay...

229
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:26,952
What do
African Americans
call the...

230
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,461
What?

231
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,729
ERIN: Deangelo?
Yeah?

232
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:36,826
Did you order a barber?

233
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,701
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on back here.

234
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,574
Put a pin on that, okay?
I can't wait to hear
the punch line.

235
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:44,109
Finish the joke, Andy.

236
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:46,609
What do
African Americans call?

237
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:48,674
I don't know. Help me.

238
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,112
That is so bad-ass.

239
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,844
Just so hardcore.

240
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:56,549
Yeah, very cool.

241
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:57,852
Real power move.
Yeah.

242
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,252
I saw a hawk today.

243
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,563
It was just
sitting right there

244
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:08,295
on the overpass,
looking at me.

245
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,934
Shave me.

246
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:18,736
Well, this is going
to be funny.

247
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,905
Because it looks like
we're gonna be
shaving buddies.

248
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,212
Okay, all right.
I love it. I love it.

249
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,185
Michael, this is Reggie.
Hello.

250
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,811
He is the number one

251
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:30,186
Yelp-reviewed
shaver in Scranton.
It's not even close.

252
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:33,784
And this is Erin,
and she's going
to shave my face.

253
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,226
Here we go.

254
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,027
All right.

255
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,206
This is how we do it.

256
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:47,399
MICHAEL: Mmm.

257
00:11:47,473 --> 00:11:48,463
Feels nice, doesn't it?

258
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,873
It really does.

259
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,574
This is luxury.
Here we go.

260
00:11:58,685 --> 00:12:00,517
Okay.
Okay.

261
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,317
Oh, that is nice.

262
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,351
You wanted to
talk to us, Deangelo?

263
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,053
Oh, yes, yes, please.
Cozy up there.

264
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,787
I just thought we could
have some rap sessions
with smaller groups.

265
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:13,162
You know, we don't
really do rap sessions,
we kind of do... God!

266
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,368
We sort of do
more of like powwows
and what-ups.

267
00:12:16,803 --> 00:12:18,101
Okay, well,
powwows, then. Fine.

268
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,400
That's...

269
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:22,442
Hey, Deangelo,
my mom just sent me
this picture of Cece.

270
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,566
It is so adorable.

271
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,276
All right, wait,
but a little bit
of back story.

272
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:26,745
She loves dogs,
she calls them dadas...

273
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,872
Dadas.

274
00:12:27,947 --> 00:12:29,506
...and what happens is...
You know what?

275
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,813
Enough about
your baby, okay?

276
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:34,011
I'm sorry.

277
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,715
Well, we were just...
I think she was
just trying to...

278
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,849
No, no, no,
I know what you're doing.
Just quit it.

279
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,391
I want to hear from
the rank and file.

280
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:46,365
How can I be
the best manager
for you all?

281
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,128
You know,
what can I do better?

282
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,033
Okay, you know
what, everybody?

283
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,663
There's... You have
to be honest here.

284
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:56,608
You can't say that everything
is perfect, right?

285
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:59,939
So, you know,
come up with something.

286
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,847
OSCAR: Well, Deangelo,
I'd say communication
could be improved.

287
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,451
People stopped
reading memos.

288
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,918
So everyone
marks them urgent.

289
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,353
Okay, you know what?
I mark it urgent "A,"

290
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,721
urgent "B,"
urgent "C," urgent "D."

291
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,692
Urgent "A" is
the most important,

292
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,162
urgent "D" you don't even
really have to worry about.

293
00:13:17,397 --> 00:13:19,764
Okay, Michael,
can you stop talking now?
I have to do your lips.

294
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,663
Don't shave my lips.

295
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,830
What's up?

296
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:27,737
I don't mean to go off
on a rant here, but...

297
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,139
I wrote the perfect joke.
Topical, edgy, funny.

298
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:36,942
I saw this thing in the news.
Democrats want electric cars.

299
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,882
Republicans don't.
Right.

300
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:40,943
I'm thinking,
how crazy is it

301
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,923
that we got
a car debate going on
in a city known for gridlock.

302
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:48,922
Um... Let's not talk politics
in the office, okay?

303
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,562
I like you better
as the funny guy.

304
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:54,658
I wasn't taking a position.
It was just sort of
one of those things.

305
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:07,143
Now that's funny.
That's funny.

306
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:08,611
You walk much?

307
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,784
Yeah, right? I mean...

308
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,283
A little click.
Mmm-hmm.

309
00:14:19,826 --> 00:14:21,192
Deangelo, this box
came for you.

310
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,353
Great, thank you.

311
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,597
That's my stuff. Yeah.

312
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,760
Michael, take a look
at this.

313
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:29,666
Need a hand?
Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

314
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,068
Hey, you know what?
This office sort of

315
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,504
has a perfect
fung shooey to it, and...

316
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:38,007
You know,
let's not go overboard
with the redecorating.

317
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,739
And I'm
still here, so...
Wow.

318
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:40,836
Right?
Ooh.

319
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,903
That's nice.

320
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:44,309
I still have to look
at this stuff, guys, so...

321
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,576
Oh, man. So this is
a 10-gallon hat?

322
00:14:46,652 --> 00:14:48,245
Yeah, you like that?
10-gallon hat.

323
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:50,813
Technically, it only
holds about 3 quarts.

324
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:52,789
A little factoid.
Interesting.

325
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,787
MICHAEL: <i>Deangelo's great.</i>
<i>I love the guy.</i>

326
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,359
But I'm not sure
he's a good fit
for the office.

327
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:01,367
And also, I'm not sure
if I love the guy.

328
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:06,803
Cool, cool.

329
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,835
All right,
see you later, girl.

330
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,069
Hey, hey, hey.

331
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,536
No, I'm good. Keep that.

332
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,708
Hey, funny man.
What you got for me?
Make me laugh.

333
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:39,938
Let's see if
my favorite tea is in...

334
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,371
Whoa! Jeez.

335
00:15:58,157 --> 00:15:59,284
That's hot coffee.

336
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,392
Drink some soap.

337
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:05,323
Eat some hand soap.

338
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:15,269
I guess this is my life now.

339
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,441
How do I become
a manager at Sabre?

340
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,546
Well, first things first,

341
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,514
thank you for coming
to me directly, you know.

342
00:16:22,582 --> 00:16:24,050
I know you could
have called Tallahassee,

343
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:26,051
but it would have
just looped back to me.

344
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,517
So it's cool you
recognized my role here.

345
00:16:27,587 --> 00:16:28,850
I left a message
at corporate.

346
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,613
There you go.

347
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,556
Get a recommendation
from Michael.

348
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,491
That'll put you
right on the short list

349
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,858
for next time
there's an opening.

350
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,393
Can't you just use
the recommendation
you already have on file?

351
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,393
What recommendation?

352
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,534
From when
he recommended me
to replace him.

353
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,062
Um...

354
00:16:48,307 --> 00:16:50,572
I'm sorry.
I never know how to act

355
00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:52,874
in these awkward
type situations.

356
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,406
Best whale watching?
Easily the West Coast.

357
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:57,973
If you're gonna
go whale watching
on the East Coast,

358
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,077
you might want to
bring a magazine called
<i>West Coast Whales.</i>

359
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,386


360
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:07,119
Snack time!
It's the witching hour.
It is the sandwiching hour.

361
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:08,283
Awesome.

362
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,385
PHYLLIS: Hmm. What you got?

363
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,328
PB and J. My mom's recipe.

364
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:13,525
Michael, Deangelo
has a peanut allergy.

365
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,194
Okay, I need a wide berth.
I need a wide berth
from those nuts.

366
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:17,903
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

367
00:17:18,004 --> 00:17:20,405
I think Kevin wants one.
Kevin, here you go.

368
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:23,303
OSCAR: Michael,
this is serious.

369
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,174
Do you know what happens
if Deangelo touches a peanut?

370
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,268
What?

371
00:17:26,345 --> 00:17:28,541
Michael, the last time
I was exposed to a peanut,

372
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,810
I was itchy for
three days, okay?

373
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,944
I had to take
baths constantly.
I missed the O.J. verdict.

374
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,682
Had to read about it in
the paper like an idiot.

375
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,725
Wait, so you
don't go into, like,
shock or die or anything?

376
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,555
No, Jim. Not
everything's life and death.
I want to feel comfortable.

377
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,694
Oscar, here you go.

378
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:46,258
Oh! Whoa!

379
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,563
You're getting nut
particles all in the air.

380
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:52,071
No one had
a problem with the air here
until you came around.

381
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,844
Everyone, mandatory meeting.
Multi-purpose room, now.

382
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,248
No, that's good.
You just stay in there.

383
00:18:05,318 --> 00:18:06,911
Except for Michael.
Stay in there
by yourself, loser.

384
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,012
Nobody go in.
Nobody go in there.
Why?

385
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,522
Why?
Stay where you are.

386
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,853
Michael, this is insane.

387
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,256
No, it's not
insane, Oscar.

388
00:18:13,326 --> 00:18:15,261
I've been here
for 19 years,

389
00:18:15,328 --> 00:18:17,024
and just because
someone else is
called the boss,

390
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,462
you're gonna throw
it all away? No, no.

391
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:26,401
Listen, you're the one
who decided to leave.

392
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:29,067
Come on, he's our new boss.
You know we have to do this.

393
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:30,675
Okay.

394
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:34,270
Well, who needs them?

395
00:18:34,347 --> 00:18:35,610
Looks like it's just
you and me, Dwight.

396
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,983
Correction.
Just you.

397
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,118
All right. Meeting,
multi-function room.

398
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,419
DEANGELO: Apology accepted.

399
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,119
Hold on.

400
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,594
Hey, Michael.
Michael, wait up,
hold up. Hold up.

401
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,926
Um...

402
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:00,298
So, for these meetings,

403
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,308
do you just jump
into business

404
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,241
or do you start
with some chitchat or...

405
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:09,104
I start with some chitchat
and maybe a couple of jokes.

406
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,008
And you might
want to develop
a couple of characters.

407
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:15,618
You know what?
You just...
You'll be fine.

408
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,655
Maybe, maybe not. 50-50.

409
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,427
You know,
it is too bad for this place
that you're leaving.

410
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,135
Bring it in. Come on.

411
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,673
Bring it.

412
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:39,172
Okay. Okay.

413
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,921
Why did you have
to be so damn good?

414
00:19:55,294 --> 00:19:57,991
I... I'm adequate.

415
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,361
I'm half as good as you.

416
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:03,265
No, no, no.
Come on.

417
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:06,169
You are good.
They know it.
Come on.

418
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,266
I just didn't expect you
to get there so fast.

419
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,876
DEANGELO: Would you do me
a favor and enjoy this time,
okay? You've worked so hard.

420
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:17,075
Get your senioritis on.
It's Lake Havasu time.

421
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:19,678
I guess I've been
working so hard

422
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:21,880
I forgot what it's like
to be hardly working.

423
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,458
Okay.

424
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,868
What is the Native
American girl's name?

425
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,694
You'll figure it out.

426
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:48,876
DEANGELO:
Thank you, Dwight.

427
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:50,143
DWIGHT: Thank you, sir.

428
00:20:53,853 --> 00:20:55,082
DEANGELO: Listen up...

429
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:02,261
Hey, Deangelo.
Want to meet Cece?

430
00:21:09,068 --> 00:21:11,401
That's a cute baby.

431
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,065
Very cute baby.
Adorable. Very cute.

432
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,472
Thank you very much.

433
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,770
See? We knew it.

434
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,367
If he just met her,
he'd understand.

435
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:19,912
We're back in.

436
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,446
Ha.
Ha.

437
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:22,607
Right?

438
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,446
I'm telling you, that baby
could be the star of a show

439
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:27,987
called <i>Babies I</i>
<i>Don't Care About.</i>
