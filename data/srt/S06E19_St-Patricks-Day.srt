1
00:00:04,369 --> 00:00:06,030
Hello, hello.

2
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:08,803
Top of the morning to you.

3
00:00:10,108 --> 00:00:13,942
Green M&M's.
Nature's Viagra.

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:17,676
Two of my favorite joke areas
combined. It's gonna be a good day.

5
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:18,943
I don't want to
bring my friends.

6
00:00:19,017 --> 00:00:20,006
Why can't it
just be the two of us?

7
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:21,677
Because it's St. Patrick's
Day. People go out in groups.

8
00:00:21,753 --> 00:00:22,777
Well, why don't you
invite your friends?

9
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:24,014
Why are you being
so weird about this?

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,058
Stop fighting! Just on
St. Patrick's Day, okay?

11
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:29,889
Just one
perfect day a year.

12
00:00:29,961 --> 00:00:33,522
No hassles,
no problems, no kids.

13
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:35,226
Why no kids?

14
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,733
Yeah, where are your kids?

15
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:39,293
Nope. Uh-uh. Not today.

16
00:00:40,338 --> 00:00:41,737
<i>It is
St. Patrick's Day,</i>

17
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:45,402
<i>and here in Scranton,
that is a huge deal.</i>

18
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:50,109
It is the closest that the
Irish will ever get to Christmas.

19
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:14,897
Welcome back, Dad.

20
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:15,997
Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:16,074 --> 00:01:17,234
Hey.
- Hey.

22
00:01:17,309 --> 00:01:18,401
Hey!

23
00:01:18,477 --> 00:01:19,876
Welcome back, Tuna.

24
00:01:19,945 --> 00:01:21,037
Hey.

25
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,639
Very good. Okay, we'll get
back to you on that right away. Thanks.

26
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,775
What do we got here?

27
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,377
Mega-desk.
Of course.

28
00:01:29,454 --> 00:01:30,785
Command central.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:33,051
Surveillance, gaming
and business.

30
00:01:34,092 --> 00:01:35,354
Okay.

31
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:43,458
What? Come on. Jim!

32
00:01:43,969 --> 00:01:45,459
Tweedledee and
Tweedle Dumbass

33
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,437
have been away
on maternity leave,

34
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:50,373
but now Tweedle Dumbass is
back and we have a problem.

35
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,900
<i>Yes, getting hooked on
mega-desk was my own damn fault.</i>

36
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:56,612
<i>I don't care
about assigning blame.</i>

37
00:01:57,382 --> 00:02:00,044
<i>All I care about is mega-desk.</i>

38
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:05,420
That is all I care about.
Getting more mega-desk.

39
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:09,456
Oh, I love this.
So much fun.

40
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:12,019
There's such team spirit
in this room.

41
00:02:12,097 --> 00:02:13,792
Morning, darling.
Morning.

42
00:02:13,865 --> 00:02:16,459
Well, this is my last day at
the Scranton branch for a while,

43
00:02:16,535 --> 00:02:18,469
<i>but I'm leaving it in
the very capable hands</i>

44
00:02:18,537 --> 00:02:20,971
<i>of some of the loveliest people I've
ever had the pleasure of knowing.</i>

45
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:23,507
You know,
I'm gonna miss this place,

46
00:02:23,575 --> 00:02:24,837
and the snow.

47
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:29,108
Do my dogs
love peeing in that snow!

48
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:31,171
Makes me think
they're onto something.

49
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,817
Oh, good morning,
sweetheart.

50
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:35,944
Good morning, honey pile.

51
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,353
I'm sorry, but is that a
gift I see in your hands?

52
00:02:38,423 --> 00:02:40,891
It is. This is a
little something for you

53
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,655
to remember your time here
in Scranton by.

54
00:02:45,096 --> 00:02:46,256
Is that a lump of coal?

55
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:47,355
Yes, it is.

56
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:48,524
I haven't been that naughty.

57
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,535
No, no, no. That is
a good gift, actually.

58
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:54,401
Buildings here in Scranton
are literally powered by coal.

59
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:56,872
Uh... Thank you very much.

60
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,406
We don't get much coal
down in Tallahassee.

61
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,035
I mean,
just alligators

62
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,841
and some of the worst Chinese
food you've ever tasted.

63
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,109
Mmm, that sounds
great, actually.

64
00:03:05,183 --> 00:03:08,050
Well, if you ever get down
in my neck of the woods,

65
00:03:08,119 --> 00:03:09,780
you got a place to stay.

66
00:03:10,255 --> 00:03:12,155
<i>When you work for
Sabre, only one thing matters,</i>

67
00:03:12,223 --> 00:03:16,887
and I don't care if you're a
loser or you practice bestiality,

68
00:03:17,162 --> 00:03:19,255
if Jo likes you,
you are in.

69
00:03:19,531 --> 00:03:21,556
And I am in.

70
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:25,863
Erin Go Bragh.

71
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:28,064
Andy "Go Bragh" to you.

72
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:29,868
Nice kilt.
Thanks.

73
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:32,442
It's actually my sister's
old field hockey skirt.

74
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,377
Erin and I have our first date
tonight and it has to be perfect.

75
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,938
<i>Why? Because according
to How I Met Your Mother,</i>

76
00:03:38,016 --> 00:03:41,008
that's the date that your kids are
gonna wait patiently to hear about,

77
00:03:41,086 --> 00:03:43,247
and you better have
a good story for them.

78
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:47,416
Nope.
Great.

79
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,516
No.
Thank you.

80
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:50,026
No, no, no, no, no.

81
00:03:50,095 --> 00:03:51,858
Come on. Come on.
Five more minutes.

82
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:54,421
Five more minutes
of mega-desk? Please?

83
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,201
Is this yours or mine?

84
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:02,705
They say that
no man is an island.

85
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:08,075
False. I am an island,
and this island is volcanic.

86
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:09,408
Mega-desk!

87
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:14,851
And it is about to erupt with
the molten hot lava of strategy.

88
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:18,552
Good Lord. I can't
believe I'm missing this.

89
00:04:18,623 --> 00:04:20,318
<i>It's kind of like that
lip thing she did last night,</i>

90
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,383
<i>like a half-snarl,
half-smile.</i>

91
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,155
<i>I get the sense
that she's very ironic.</i>

92
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,959
Okay. Love you.
We'll talk soon.

93
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,758
Must be amazing
being a father, right?

94
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:32,063
The miracle of life.

95
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:33,729
It is. Big time.

96
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:38,071
Ah, that baby is just discovering
a whole wide world right now.

97
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,009
It's pretty amazing.
What up is, what down is,

98
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,479
who Mom is,
who Dad is.

99
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:46,312
Must be tough being here
with all that going on.

100
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:48,409
It's tough being here
for a lot of reasons.

101
00:04:48,486 --> 00:04:50,078
I mean,
you're here at work

102
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:53,522
and the baby thinks that the
refrigerator is its father.

103
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:55,960
Is that what
happened to you?

104
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:57,995
I'll tell you
what happened to me.

105
00:04:58,063 --> 00:05:00,759
I didn't see my father for
the first two years of my life.

106
00:05:00,832 --> 00:05:04,290
I thought my mother was my father
and my wet nurse was my mother.

107
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,927
And that's
a common mistake.

108
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,336
Turned out fine
for me. But Mose?

109
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:13,200
Oh, same story,
different ending.

110
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,280
Hey, are you sick?

111
00:05:21,352 --> 00:05:23,843
Oh, no, I'm fine. I just
have a little indigestion.

112
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:26,185
In your nose?
Yes.

113
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,424
<i>I'm a little sick, but I
don't want to miss my date with Andy.</i>

114
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,689
I'll get better.

115
00:05:31,763 --> 00:05:33,890
Whenever I'm sick it goes
away within a few hours,

116
00:05:33,965 --> 00:05:37,765
except once when I was in the
hospital from age three to six.

117
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:42,499
Now, after all the talking
I've been doing, it's your turn.

118
00:05:43,174 --> 00:05:46,871
This is a town hall meeting. I
want to hear what y'all sound like.

119
00:05:46,945 --> 00:05:48,845
That is a great idea, J.B.
Thank you.

120
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,609
You know, I get way
too many ideas from the top.

121
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,548
Now, I want to
hear your ideas.

122
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:56,519
I mean, did you guys
know that Liquid Paper,

123
00:05:56,588 --> 00:05:59,318
that wasn't invented
by some fancy engineer.

124
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,120
No, that was created
by a lowly typist.

125
00:06:02,827 --> 00:06:07,230
Oh, Jo, I have an idea
for suntan lotion soap.

126
00:06:07,532 --> 00:06:09,523
You know, it doesn't
have to be an invention.

127
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:10,625
I have a question.

128
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:12,567
Oscar, homosexual accountant.

129
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,264
In the training manual,
it says that

130
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:17,240
there's a minority executive
training program in Tallahassee.

131
00:06:17,308 --> 00:06:20,835
I am so proud of Sabre's
Print In All Colors initiative.

132
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:25,245
Any Sabre employee of color
is welcome to apply, okay?

133
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:26,841
Darryl?

134
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,443
Darryl. Mellow, soulful,
smart for warehouse.

135
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,954
Okay, hush now.
Okay.

136
00:06:31,022 --> 00:06:34,389
The Sabre shipping method
could be more efficient.

137
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,656
Combining inventory systems
makes sense on paper,

138
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:40,629
but printers and paper
ship differently.

139
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:43,166
It would be faster
to deliver them separately

140
00:06:43,234 --> 00:06:44,701
instead of waiting
on everything to come in.

141
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:46,293
But you wouldn't need
more trucks? I mean...

142
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:49,306
Not at all. There's a
way it can be scheduled.

143
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,773
I sketched
this out downstairs.

144
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:51,866
Well, look at you.

145
00:06:51,943 --> 00:06:55,310
Look at that picture
that you drew. Nice job.

146
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,143
We are very
proud of you.

147
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,546
You know what? We are
going to tape that up

148
00:06:58,616 --> 00:07:00,083
on the refrigerator
in the kitchen.

149
00:07:00,151 --> 00:07:01,982
I like this, Darryl.

150
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,116
I like this a lot.

151
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:06,953
Maybe you should be
doing your sketching upstairs.

152
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,151
Would you like
an office up here?

153
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,057
Are you serious?
Yeah.

154
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,322
Take Jim's old office.

155
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,762
Oh, I set my stuff
up in there.

156
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,562
So, just give me a few minutes
to clean it out for you.

157
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:19,034
Yeah. I want to
hear more from you.

158
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:20,127
Absolutely.

159
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:21,433
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

160
00:07:21,506 --> 00:07:25,465
Okay. Any questions?
Anything on anybody's mind?

161
00:07:25,543 --> 00:07:26,840
I'm leaving tonight.

162
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,640
This is your last
chance for a while.

163
00:07:28,713 --> 00:07:32,547
No! Say it's not so,
Jo! We're gonna miss you.

164
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,346
We are gonna
miss you so much!

165
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,408
Don't go away!

166
00:07:35,486 --> 00:07:37,784
Okay. Florida
ain't that far away.

167
00:07:37,889 --> 00:07:39,584
Well, I'm heading
down there.

168
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:41,248
Well, anytime, now.
So, who...

169
00:07:41,326 --> 00:07:44,056
How about
July 4th weekend?

170
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:47,229
Oh, honey,
you didn't buy a ticket.

171
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,560
I did.

172
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:52,634
Oh, honey,
I am not home very often,

173
00:07:53,137 --> 00:07:56,004
and me and my relatives,
they take up the guest house.

174
00:07:56,074 --> 00:07:57,541
I think you should
check with my office

175
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,839
before you book
any dates, okay?

176
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:03,005
You know what? In the
spirit of full disclosure,

177
00:08:03,248 --> 00:08:05,910
I have actually reserved
a bunch of different seats

178
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,144
on a bunch
of different flights,

179
00:08:07,218 --> 00:08:09,209
but there are a couple flights
that only have two tickets left,

180
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:10,276
so I think we should
pull the trigger...

181
00:08:10,355 --> 00:08:11,549
Enough!

182
00:08:16,628 --> 00:08:20,064
All right, everybody. Just
try to put a brave face on.

183
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,623
Let's follow
the chain of events.

184
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,860
Jo likes Michael,

185
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,830
Jo invites
Michael to house,

186
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:30,571
Jo doesn't like
Michael anymore.

187
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:34,336
Mmm.

188
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,946
<i>Moving on up
To the east side</i>

189
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:47,024
<i>To a deluxe apartment
in the sky</i>

190
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,392
Hello. I want you to stop
what you're doing right now.

191
00:08:50,461 --> 00:08:52,156
You are stressed and I
am taking you to lunch.

192
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,994
No, that's very generous
of you, but I'm all set.

193
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:56,090
No is not an option.

194
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,464
Yes, it is.

195
00:09:00,672 --> 00:09:03,607
All right, well, if you need me, I'll
be on the other side of that wall.

196
00:09:03,675 --> 00:09:05,768
Knock once for yes,
twice for no.

197
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:09,370
How many knocks does it take
to get you to do some work?

198
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,075
Okay. I'll be over there.

199
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:17,777
And I'm actually pleased

200
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:20,722
to be able to offer you printer
cartridges and toner now.

201
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:21,986
Jim.
Yeah.

202
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,652
Jim, sorry to bother you.
What?

203
00:09:23,728 --> 00:09:25,423
My headphones are broken.
Right.

204
00:09:25,496 --> 00:09:27,123
Can I listen to
my music at a low volume?

205
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,222
That's great. Great.

206
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,493
Okay.
Yeah.

207
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,333
<i>The cat's in the cradle and
the silver spoon Little boy...</i>

208
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:35,838
When was the last time
you updated your printer?

209
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:37,966
<i>"When you coming home, Dad?"
"I don't know when"</i>

210
00:09:38,042 --> 00:09:39,066
No. You need to stop now.

211
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:44,775
<i>We'll be together then, now We're
going to have a good time then</i>

212
00:09:45,516 --> 00:09:47,177
Whether it's this time
or the next time.

213
00:09:48,586 --> 00:09:51,783
<i>The cat's
in the cradle and the silver spoon</i>

214
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:54,188
<i>Little boy blue
and the man in the moon</i>

215
00:09:54,258 --> 00:09:56,385
No, we can definitely
talk about it...

216
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:58,895
You know what? Can I call you
back? That'd be great. Thank you.

217
00:09:58,963 --> 00:10:03,195
<i>We'll be together then We're
going to have a good time</i>

218
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:05,997
No, I know I need
to work, I just...

219
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,628
I feel weird
not being home.

220
00:10:07,872 --> 00:10:11,171
I am not surprised that Dwight's
using my baby to steal my desk.

221
00:10:13,177 --> 00:10:15,975
I'm a little surprised
that it's working.

222
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:18,645
This fax came for you.

223
00:10:18,716 --> 00:10:21,116
Oh, no, no, no.
Are you feeling ill?

224
00:10:21,252 --> 00:10:24,619
Oh, no, honey, if you've got a
bug, I want you to go on home.

225
00:10:24,689 --> 00:10:27,283
I can't have you getting
Callie and Jo Junior sick.

226
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:30,088
These dogs have gotta be in a
commercial with Dwight Howard next week.

227
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,220
Oh. No, I feel like
I could lift a car.

228
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:34,355
Yeah, but you sound
like death, girl.

229
00:10:34,432 --> 00:10:35,524
Now, why don't
you go on home,

230
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,965
take care of yourself,
get in bed,

231
00:10:37,035 --> 00:10:39,595
and shred that and have them
send me a clean fax, all right?

232
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:40,728
Well...

233
00:10:45,143 --> 00:10:48,112
<i>She should go home.
It's not the end of the world.</i>

234
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,147
We'll go on
a date next week.

235
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:53,342
She's still going to
like me in a week, right?

236
00:10:57,155 --> 00:10:58,144
Yes?

237
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:01,453
I was just working at my desk and I
wanted to run some new leads by you.

238
00:11:01,526 --> 00:11:03,187
Oh, you're sick.

239
00:11:03,261 --> 00:11:04,558
Dang it.

240
00:11:04,629 --> 00:11:06,153
That's exactly why I sent
that receptionist home.

241
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,254
No, no, I'm not.

242
00:11:07,331 --> 00:11:08,559
Getting everybody
sick in the office.

243
00:11:08,633 --> 00:11:09,657
I have some
good ideas that...

244
00:11:09,734 --> 00:11:11,497
I don't need any
heroes here, honey.

245
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:13,196
It's time for you
to go on home now.

246
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,636
You sure?
Yeah.

247
00:11:14,705 --> 00:11:18,004
You'll probably feel better once
you get some pants on. Come on.

248
00:11:24,782 --> 00:11:26,750
Very nice.
Not bad, huh?

249
00:11:26,818 --> 00:11:29,412
<i>Real Hoop Dreams story
you got there.</i>

250
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:33,917
Oh, man, you seem
to have caught Jo's eye.

251
00:11:33,991 --> 00:11:35,925
How'd you make that happen?

252
00:11:35,993 --> 00:11:37,688
I impressed her
with my good ideas.

253
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:40,629
Seriously. How did you do it?

254
00:11:41,065 --> 00:11:43,590
I made a suggestion at
the meeting that was good.

255
00:11:43,668 --> 00:11:44,692
You were there.

256
00:11:44,769 --> 00:11:46,964
How do I put
this delicately?

257
00:11:47,638 --> 00:11:51,972
Does her family owe your family
something in terms of a past injustice?

258
00:11:55,179 --> 00:11:57,807
Now, Mike, I have
to ask you to leave

259
00:11:57,882 --> 00:12:00,680
so that I can learn
about this tiny television.

260
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:03,853
Mmm, okay. All right.

261
00:12:07,758 --> 00:12:09,419
Hey, there.
Hey, there.

262
00:12:09,494 --> 00:12:11,052
So, I think I'm done.

263
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:16,089
Gonna head out, unless you want to
chat, like we were doing earlier.

264
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,328
Well, there's chatting time
and there's working time,

265
00:12:18,402 --> 00:12:19,926
and I'm still
on working time.

266
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:24,134
Mmm? Well, the clock
says chatting time, so...

267
00:12:24,742 --> 00:12:28,178
Well, if you feel like you've
done a solid day's work.

268
00:12:28,546 --> 00:12:29,706
Right.

269
00:12:30,681 --> 00:12:31,739
What?

270
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:35,013
Well, I mean, if you can
put your name on this day

271
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,777
and be proud of the
amount of work you've done,

272
00:12:37,855 --> 00:12:40,790
then by all means, you
should toodle on home.

273
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:42,919
Mmm...

274
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,353
Okay.

275
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,632
Is there something else
I can help you with?

276
00:12:48,699 --> 00:12:51,167
No, no, no,
that's super clear-ish.

277
00:12:57,341 --> 00:12:59,741
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.

278
00:13:04,282 --> 00:13:07,012
<i>Just because
Jo has no life</i>

279
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:10,850
does not mean that the
rest of us don't have lives.

280
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:15,419
Oscar has a life. I
think Ryan has a life.

281
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,989
<i>This is outrageous.</i>

282
00:13:20,097 --> 00:13:21,086
Hey, Pac-Man.

283
00:13:21,165 --> 00:13:22,655
<i>Hey, what's up,
Butt Plug?</i>

284
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,792
How you doing, stud?
You're already there?

285
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,962
Dude, I've been
here since 3:00.

286
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:28,665
I've boot and
rallied twice.

287
00:13:28,739 --> 00:13:30,070
How's the lady situation?

288
00:13:30,141 --> 00:13:31,335
Fat and ugly.

289
00:13:31,876 --> 00:13:33,275
<i>You might actually
have a chance.</i>

290
00:13:33,344 --> 00:13:35,608
Oh, damn, that sounds great.

291
00:13:36,214 --> 00:13:39,877
Unfortunately I am stuck here because
my boss is making us work late.

292
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:44,012
Oh, here's what you do. Hike up
your skirt and pull out your tampon,

293
00:13:44,522 --> 00:13:46,922
borrow some balls
and come meet me.

294
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:48,720
Yeah, maybe next year.

295
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,317
<i>Maybe next queer.</i>

296
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:53,596
<i>Hey, ladies, who wants
some bangers and mash?</i>

297
00:13:57,468 --> 00:13:59,561
Oh, Andy!
Hi.

298
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:01,298
I'm in my jammy-jams.

299
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:03,602
That's okay.
I'm in my worky-works.

300
00:14:04,475 --> 00:14:05,840
You look amazing.

301
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,003
Thanks.

302
00:14:08,212 --> 00:14:09,736
Come in.
Okay.

303
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:16,152
Hey, me and Creed are in.
Are you guys in?

304
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,015
Oh, I'm in.
I'm in.

305
00:14:18,089 --> 00:14:19,420
All right.

306
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,563
<i>Oh, you don't become the
most powerful woman in Tallahassee</i>

307
00:14:31,636 --> 00:14:33,160
<i>by slacking off.</i>

308
00:14:33,237 --> 00:14:35,671
You do it by working hard.

309
00:14:36,741 --> 00:14:38,174
Or marrying rich.

310
00:14:39,143 --> 00:14:40,508
I did both.

311
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:45,014
Got a little client meeting
at Shanny O'Gannigans tonight.

312
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:46,913
It shouldn't
go all night long,

313
00:14:46,984 --> 00:14:48,884
so if you'd like me to,
I can swing by your house

314
00:14:48,953 --> 00:14:52,150
so the baby can experience
a strong male presence.

315
00:14:53,624 --> 00:14:55,285
No? Nothing?

316
00:14:55,359 --> 00:14:57,725
Okay, have fun working.

317
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:06,092
Hi there, Jo.
Sorry to interrupt.

318
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:08,297
This evening I have...

319
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:11,168
Hello?
Hey, Jo, it's Jim Halpert.

320
00:15:11,242 --> 00:15:14,973
I actually scheduled a meeting at
7:30 with a very important client,

321
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:18,311
and it's so weird, 'cause we never
have meetings after 5:00 p.m.,

322
00:15:18,382 --> 00:15:22,113
but I was hoping that maybe
just this once it would be okay.

323
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:25,478
Well, sure. You know, you go
ahead and push some printers.

324
00:15:25,556 --> 00:15:26,545
You know I will.

325
00:15:26,624 --> 00:15:29,787
And by the way, seriously,
we never, never do this.

326
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,122
Okay.
Okay.

327
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,628
All right.

328
00:15:32,763 --> 00:15:34,856
Sorry, sugar.
What did you want?

329
00:15:35,533 --> 00:15:39,594
Well, you see, I actually do
have a meeting with a client.

330
00:15:41,439 --> 00:15:43,805
I'm gonna just
reschedule for next week.

331
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:45,973
Thank you.

332
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,770
Thanks again,
by the way.

333
00:15:53,017 --> 00:15:54,780
Hey, what are you
fellows doing up here?

334
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:55,978
We're here
to bust you out.

335
00:15:56,053 --> 00:15:57,042
I wish, but I...

336
00:15:57,121 --> 00:15:59,214
Dude, is your
shirt tucked in?

337
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:02,155
Oh, yeah.

338
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:04,558
I must have did that
when I used the bathroom.

339
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,161
All right, then.
Let me get to it.

340
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,392
All right.

341
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,791
See you later.

342
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:21,208
Your hand's cold.

343
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:22,336
It is? I'm sorry.
Yeah.

344
00:16:22,413 --> 00:16:23,471
Have some more blanket.

345
00:16:23,547 --> 00:16:24,536
Oh, thanks.

346
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:25,604
What's up?

347
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:26,707
You're awake?

348
00:16:26,784 --> 00:16:28,911
Andy, this is
my brother, Reed.

349
00:16:28,986 --> 00:16:30,214
I didn't know
you had a brother.

350
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,312
He's my foster brother.

351
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,382
Well, any brother of
Erin's is a friend of mine.

352
00:16:35,459 --> 00:16:36,721
Nice to meet you.
Andy Bernard.

353
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,386
Cold hands.

354
00:16:39,296 --> 00:16:40,991
Are we rotating seats or...

355
00:16:41,065 --> 00:16:42,327
Yeah, you're the guest.

356
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,868
Go take the easy chair.
Best seat in the house.

357
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,232
Plus, you don't
have to sit next

358
00:16:46,303 --> 00:16:48,669
to this big dork
and her smelly feet.

359
00:16:48,739 --> 00:16:52,368
Hey. My feet aren't smelly. They
smell like roses. Smell them.

360
00:16:52,443 --> 00:16:54,434
Whoa.

361
00:17:00,718 --> 00:17:03,243
So how does the whole
foster sibling thing work?

362
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,914
Do you guys
share one parent or...

363
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,221
None. We were in the same
house from ages 10 to 12

364
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:11,193
and then from 15 to 18.

365
00:17:12,196 --> 00:17:14,664
Right. Formative years.

366
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:16,957
Nice skirt.

367
00:17:17,034 --> 00:17:18,194
It's a kilt.

368
00:17:23,641 --> 00:17:26,007
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

369
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,882
Yes, I am anxious
to get out of work,

370
00:17:34,952 --> 00:17:36,180
but let me be clear,

371
00:17:36,253 --> 00:17:38,585
it's not to celebrate
St. Patrick's Day.

372
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:41,022
It's so I can protest St. Patrick's Day.

373
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,116
Overnight all
my damn bags home.

374
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:45,128
I'm carrying nothing
but my sable gloves.

375
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:47,164
I've had it with
Homeland Security.

376
00:17:47,231 --> 00:17:50,962
And I want you to put all those
tracking numbers in my BlackBerry.

377
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:52,400
How late are we
gonna work tonight?

378
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,769
You never know with Jo. Sometimes
we're here until midnight,

379
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,070
sometimes she doesn't
show up for three days.

380
00:17:58,142 --> 00:17:59,234
Why does she do that?

381
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,175
Why doesn't she just tell
you what your schedule is?

382
00:18:01,245 --> 00:18:04,214
Yeah. That'd be awesome.
I could get a girlfriend.

383
00:18:04,281 --> 00:18:06,442
I wouldn't have to go to
Amsterdam seven times a year.

384
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:09,748
But I'm young, right?
I will date when I'm dead.

385
00:18:12,556 --> 00:18:15,252
Do I really want
to turn out like Gabe?

386
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,255
Twenty-six, single,

387
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:21,395
tied to my desk,
no life, no family.

388
00:18:21,465 --> 00:18:25,196
I want to have been married by
the time I would have turned 30.

389
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,727
That's just...
That's just depressing.

390
00:18:30,875 --> 00:18:31,864
Hello, Jo.

391
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,933
Anything I can do
for you, pudding?

392
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:37,310
There is, as a matter of fact.
It's getting sort of late.

393
00:18:37,381 --> 00:18:40,578
It's 8:30 and
it's St. Patrick's Day,

394
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,209
which is
a world ethnic holiday,

395
00:18:42,286 --> 00:18:45,585
so I have decided I'm going
to dismiss my employees.

396
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,048
Hmm.

397
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:48,890
I'm thrilled with the work
they've done today,

398
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,756
both the quality
and the quantity.

399
00:18:50,828 --> 00:18:54,229
Great performance. Very,
very solid all the way around.

400
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:55,890
All right, then.

401
00:18:57,468 --> 00:18:59,698
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.

402
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:05,967
And also,

403
00:19:06,043 --> 00:19:10,139
I would like to say that I will be
canceling my trip down to Tallahassee,

404
00:19:10,214 --> 00:19:13,945
although I do look forward to
our professional relationship.

405
00:19:15,653 --> 00:19:17,143
Michael?
Yes?

406
00:19:18,989 --> 00:19:21,116
I look forward to that, too.

407
00:19:30,634 --> 00:19:31,658
Oh.

408
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,633
It's coming down out there.
Yes.

409
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,866
Thank you
for coming all the way here.

410
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:40,138
No, no. My pleasure.
I'm sorry I was so sick.

411
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:02,354
Great. Now I'm gonna get sick.

412
00:20:03,634 --> 00:20:08,628
Excuse me! Excuse me!
Hey, guys, how are you?

413
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,500
Drinks are on me.

414
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:15,872
No, no, no, put your credit
cards away! It's on us.

415
00:20:15,946 --> 00:20:18,414
All right!

416
00:20:18,482 --> 00:20:19,949
<i>Did I mess up
my career today</i>

417
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,541
<i>or my future
prospects at Sabre?</i>

418
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:24,520
<i>I don't know.
There is a chance, yes.</i>

419
00:20:25,022 --> 00:20:26,649
<i>I'll tell you,
I love my job,</i>

420
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:30,785
<i>but Jo wants me to put on a show
for her and pretend to work late?</i>

421
00:20:31,629 --> 00:20:32,618
<i>Nah.</i>

422
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:36,396
<i>I spent all day trying
to make her like me,</i>

423
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,025
<i>but I forgot to
ask myself something.</i>

424
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:39,592
<i>Do I even like her?</i>

425
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:43,970
As the Irish poet Bobby McFerrin
said, "Don't worry, be happy."

426
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,564
Whoops.

427
00:20:45,643 --> 00:20:49,340
Okay. Okay. All right.

428
00:20:49,413 --> 00:20:50,812
Best night ever.

429
00:20:53,517 --> 00:20:55,678
What the hell is
going on back there?

430
00:20:57,287 --> 00:21:01,883
Yeah. We should be able to
have that over to you by Monday.

431
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,820
Yeah, no problem.

432
00:21:05,562 --> 00:21:07,257
Thank you.

433
00:21:07,331 --> 00:21:08,821
What the hell is this?

434
00:21:09,266 --> 00:21:10,528
Oh!
This is not mega-desk.

435
00:21:10,601 --> 00:21:13,263
No, it's not. They call it "quad-desk."

436
00:21:13,537 --> 00:21:15,835
That's ridiculous. This
is made up of three desks.

437
00:21:18,075 --> 00:21:19,440
Oh, my God.

438
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,436
We're gonna have to
rename it then, aren't we?

439
00:21:28,786 --> 00:21:29,946
Hello. Dwight Schrute.
