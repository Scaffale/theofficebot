1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:03,669
Hey, have they left for the big meeting
yet? I got Michael's lucky tie.

2
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,871
No, they're in
the conference room.

3
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:07,373
Okay.

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,941
Wait, are those Michael's Levis?

5
00:00:08,943 --> 00:00:11,176
Yeah.
Who dry-cleans jeans?

6
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,445
Michael and his jeans.

7
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,347
He gets in them and...

8
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,016
I'm not exactly sure
what happens,

9
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:20,486
but I can tell you,
he loves the way he looks

10
00:00:20,488 --> 00:00:22,254
in those jeans.

11
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,957
I know that's why
he started casual Fridays.

12
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:26,492
I'll take those.

13
00:00:26,494 --> 00:00:30,496
Thanks.

14
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,900
This is a projection
of the county's needs.

15
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,070
Wow, graphs and charts.

16
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,038
Somebody's really
been doing their homework.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,840
Looks like USA Today.

18
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,076
13 schools, 2 hospitals...

19
00:01:17,078 --> 00:01:19,111
So this possible client
they're talking about.

20
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:20,312
Actually, a big deal.

21
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:22,114
It's Lackawanna County.

22
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:24,049
Our whole county.

23
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,317
And if we get this,

24
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,221
they might not have
to downsize our branch.

25
00:01:29,223 --> 00:01:31,757
And I could work here for years.

26
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,629
And years and... years.

27
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:40,065
So, when we get
to the Radisson, I'd like to...

28
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,800
Oh, I changed it to Chili's.

29
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:43,969
Excuse me?

30
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:46,371
Radisson just gives out
this vibe.

31
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:48,307
It's like, "Oh, I'm doing
business at the Radisson."

32
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,976
It's kinda snooty, so...

33
00:01:50,978 --> 00:01:52,144
You had no right
to do that, Michael.

34
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:53,979
Here's the thing, Chili's...

35
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,281
is the new golf course.

36
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:57,950
It's where business happens.

37
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,186
Small Businessman Magazine.

38
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:02,254
It said that.

39
00:02:02,256 --> 00:02:03,422
It will.
I sent it in.

40
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,590
Letter to the editor.

41
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,693
All right.

42
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:10,195
But you will let me
run this meeting.

43
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:11,196
Mmmm.
Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,498
Mm-hmm.
Power trip.

45
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,101
She had done
a background check on me.

46
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:17,503
She had it printed out.

47
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,804
No.
Yeah.

48
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,839
And she was asking
me about stuff line by line

49
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,940
while we were having dinner.

50
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:23,208
That is unbelievable.

51
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,343
What's going on?

52
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:26,645
We are doing worst first dates.

53
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,447
Oh, my God.
I win.

54
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,816
Okay, it was a minor league
hockey game.

55
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,684
He brought his brother.

56
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:33,952
And when I went to the bathroom,

57
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,687
the game ended,
and they forgot about me.

58
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:36,755
Okay, that's a joke.

59
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:39,091
No, they had
to come back for me.

60
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:41,026
Wait, when was this?

61
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:43,028
Um...

62
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,598
It was not that long ago.

63
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,799
Wait, not Roy.

64
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,335
Say it's not your fiancÃ©.

65
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:55,240
I always knew Pam
has refused to go

66
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,042
to sports games with Roy.

67
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,444
But I never knew why.

68
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:02,147
Interesting.

69
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,616
Okay, let's do this thing.

70
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:06,018
Wish us luck.

71
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,452
Good luck, Michael.
Good luck, Jan.

72
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:08,654
Thank you.
Kiss ass.

73
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,890
Okay, probably going
to go late tonight.

74
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,759
Burning the midnight tequila.

75
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:16,295
So I think you all
could just take off now.

76
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:18,163
Michael, this shouldn't
take more than an hour.

77
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:19,331
Well...

78
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,699
Do you always shut down
the entire office

79
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,934
when you leave for an hour?

80
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:23,669
No, no.

81
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:25,470
That would not be efficient.

82
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,372
Actually, they just don't get
very much work done

83
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,707
when I'm not here.

84
00:03:30,643 --> 00:03:33,645
That's not true.
I know how to delegate.

85
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,648
And they do more work
when I'm not here.

86
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:39,551
Not more...
the same amount of work...

87
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,087
is done whether I am here
or not.

88
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:44,923
Hey, everybody, listen up!

89
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:46,391
This is what we're gonna do.

90
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:49,761
You sit tight until
I return, sound good?

91
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,631
Doesn't matter.
It's an order.

92
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,499
Follow it blindly.
Mm-ha-ha!

93
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,935
Okay?

94
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:58,637
All right, ciao.

95
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,739
Adios!

96
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,708
So which way is Chili's?

97
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,643
Ah, I'll drive.
No, that's all right.

98
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:05,677
I wanna leave
straight from there.

99
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:06,878
It just a couple blocks away.

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,947
So... boy, you really
don't know Scranton, do you?

101
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,649
I know Scranton.
At all.

102
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,384
Have you ever been
to Scranton, Jen?

103
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:15,153
If it's a couple blocks away,
we can go together.

104
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:17,889
Jan Levinson-Gould.

105
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,458
Jan is cold.

106
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,892
If she was sitting
across from you on a train,

107
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,295
and she wasn't moving,
you might think she was dead.

108
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,965
We should come up with
a signal of some sort.

109
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,066
Why would we need a signal?

110
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,701
Well, in case one of us
gets into trouble,

111
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,169
the other one can signal and...

112
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,471
What kind of trouble are you
planning on

113
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:33,839
getting in, Michael?

114
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:35,274
Well, it could be either of us.

115
00:04:35,276 --> 00:04:36,575
You're gonna let me
do the talking,

116
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,043
we agreed on that.

117
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,745
Yes.

118
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,416
Hello?
Christian?

119
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,751
Yes.
I thought that was you.

120
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:46,952
Hi.
Hi.

121
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,654
Michael Scott,
this is Jan Levinson-Gould.

122
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,522
Just Jan Levinson.

123
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,623
No Gould?
No.

124
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,292
Thank you very much
for meeting with us.

125
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:54,593
Have you been waiting long?

126
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,627
No, not long.

127
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,195
Good.
Uh, Jan, what happened?

128
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,997
Michael...
Is Gould dead?

129
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,799
What, uh...
Michael.

130
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,167
We got divorced, okay?

131
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:04,202
I'm so sorry, excuse me.
Wow, you're kidding me.

132
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,337
Do you wanna talk about it?

133
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,571
Michael.

134
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:08,106
Could we have
a table for three please?

135
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:09,474
When did this happen?

136
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:10,742
We're in a meeting.
Okay.

137
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,777
This way, please.

138
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,178
All right, after you.

139
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,880
Thank you.

140
00:05:19,552 --> 00:05:20,886
I thought we could start

141
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:22,120
by going over
the needs of the county.

142
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,488
Right.

143
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,624
Well, Lackawanna County
has not been immune

144
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,594
to the slow economic growth
of the past five years.

145
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:33,899
So for us, the name of the game
is budget reduction.

146
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,400
Awesome Blossom?

147
00:05:35,402 --> 00:05:36,601
What?

148
00:05:36,603 --> 00:05:37,669
I think we should share
an Awesome Blossom.

149
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,237
What do you say?
They are awesome.

150
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:41,206
You want to, Christian?
Awesome?

151
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:43,408
Sure.
Okay, it's done.

152
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,378
Actually, Megan, may we have
an Awesome Blossom, please?

153
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,846
Extra awesome?

154
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,914
Now it is done.

155
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:50,115
So, if you have...

156
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:52,417
Hey, I heard a very very
funny joke...

157
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,119
the other day.
You wanna hear it?

158
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:57,122
Christian, you don't
have to listen to this.

159
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:58,690
It's okay.
I like jokes.

160
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,791
Okay.

161
00:05:59,793 --> 00:06:00,926
Just the one.

162
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,761
Just one joke?
Okay.

163
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:04,496
Well, if it's just
gonna be one...

164
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:07,699
I will think of
a different joke.

165
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,834
Um...

166
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:13,238
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

167
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,306
Pam, it's Michael.

168
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,874
I need you to go into my office

169
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,376
and check some data for me.

170
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,512
Okay, um, you want me
to read 'em?

171
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:21,813
Yes.

172
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,249
Okay, um, a fisherman
is walking down 5th Avenue

173
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:25,751
leading an animal behind him.

174
00:06:25,753 --> 00:06:27,252
Nope!
Nope, hold it.

175
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,720
Not as good as you think.
Pick another one.

176
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:30,021
Okay.

177
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,923
There's a transcript
between a Naval ship and...

178
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,092
Oh, hey!
Bingo.

179
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,193
And a lighthouse.

180
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,528
Yes, that is hysterical.

181
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,929
Could you start that one
from the beginning?

182
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,264
Sure.

183
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,599
There's a transcript
between a naval ship

184
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,234
and a lighthouse.

185
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:02,621
Is this real?

186
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:04,656
It is a screenplay...

187
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,991
starring himself.

188
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:07,759
Agent Michael Scarn.

189
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,327
Of the F.B.I.

190
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,796
How long is this?

191
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:14,866
Oh, Pam, good work.

192
00:07:14,868 --> 00:07:16,835
Oh, wait, stop.

193
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,170
Drawings.

194
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:19,204
What is that?

195
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,973
Oh, those are drawings in case

196
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:24,276
the writing didn't really
put a picture in your head.

197
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,178
And there he is in the flesh,

198
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,246
Agent Michael Scarn.

199
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,981
Now we know what he looks like.

200
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,051
First guy says,
"Well, I'm an astronaut,

201
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,453
so I drive a Saturn."

202
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:37,322
And the second guy says,
"Well, I am a pimp,

203
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,758
so I drive a cheap Escort."

204
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,593
And the third guy says,
"I got you both beat.

205
00:07:41,595 --> 00:07:46,498
I'm a proctologist
so I drive a brown Probe."

206
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,234
Oh, no!

207
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,338
Oh, my God, that's funny!

208
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,174
I almost had Awesome Blossom
coming out of my nose!

209
00:07:57,711 --> 00:07:59,444
Excuse me, could I have
a vodka tonic, please?

210
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:02,147
Do we all have our copy
of Threat Level Midnight

211
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:03,281
by Michael Scott?

212
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:07,486
All right,
let's get this started.

213
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:09,554
I'm gonna be reading
the action descriptions.

214
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:11,490
And Phyllis, I would
like you to play

215
00:08:11,492 --> 00:08:12,724
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

216
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:14,226
That's the character's name?

217
00:08:14,228 --> 00:08:16,261
Okay, you guys should not
be doing this!

218
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,462
Why not, Dwight?

219
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,797
This is a movie.

220
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:21,299
I mean, this is for all
of America to enjoy.

221
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:23,468
You took something
that doesn't belong to you.

222
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,003
Dwight. Brought it in here,
made copies of it...

223
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,772
Do you want to play
the lead role

224
00:08:27,774 --> 00:08:29,541
of Agent Michael Scarn?

225
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:33,378
Arrgh!
Num num num.

226
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,913
That's delicious!

227
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,414
I love it.

228
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,317
We would probably
be upset with ourselves

229
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:41,953
if we went this whole night
without talking business.

230
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,890
So Dunder Miflin can provide...

231
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:47,559
a level of personal service
to the county

232
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:50,428
That the warehouse chains
just can't match.

233
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,230
Well, we are out to save money.

234
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,231
What's the bottom line?

235
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,366
Blah!
Blah blah blah.

236
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,001
Blu bad be bah.

237
00:08:56,003 --> 00:09:00,272
That's why I wanted
a signal between us.

238
00:09:00,274 --> 00:09:02,908
So I wouldn't have
to just shout nonsense words.

239
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,476
That's her fault.

240
00:09:04,478 --> 00:09:09,281
Did somebody say baby back ribs?

241
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:11,149
Hmm?
Hmm?

242
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:14,085
I don't think Christian
has time for that, Michael.

243
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:15,954
I have time.

244
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,032
Inside the F.B.I.,
Agent Michael Scarn

245
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,633
sits with his feet
up on his desk.

246
00:09:28,635 --> 00:09:30,602
Catherine Zeta-Jones enters.

247
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,470
Sir, you have some messages.

248
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:34,739
Not now!
They're important.

249
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,075
Okay, what are they?

250
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:39,077
The first message is...
I love you.

251
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,579
That's from me.

252
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,213
Not in 1,000 years, Catherine.

253
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,281
We work together.

254
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,950
And get off my desk.

255
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:46,952
Yes, I have acted before.

256
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:49,821
I was in a production of
Oklahoma in the seventh grade.

257
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,625
I played the part
of Mutie the mailman.

258
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,060
They had too many kids,

259
00:09:55,062 --> 00:09:57,829
so they make up roles like that.

260
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:58,997
I was good.

261
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:00,699
If it isn't my old partner,

262
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:03,301
Samuel L. Chang.

263
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:06,571
Agent Michael Scarn,
you lost some weight.

264
00:10:06,573 --> 00:10:09,774
Thank you for noticing.

265
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,043
Now, keep me company
for one more mission.

266
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:14,980
Hey, I have to work late.

267
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,882
You're joking, right?

268
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,250
Michael Scarn takes out
a nine millimeter gun

269
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,119
and shoots the cake to bits.

270
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:26,925
Ha ha ha, Agent Michael Scarn,
you so funny.

271
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,059
Word.

272
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,728
Michael's movie?

273
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,696
Two thumbs down.

274
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:40,972
A man sitting several seats down

275
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,742
who has a gold face
turns to Michael Scarn.

276
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:45,443
Uh, ooh.

277
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:48,847
Oscar, you wanna play
Goldenface?

278
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:51,049
Mr. Scarn, perhaps you would
be comfortable

279
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,183
in my private jet.

280
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:54,686
Yes, perhaps I would,
Goldenface.

281
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,121
Sam, get my luggage.

282
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:58,056
I forget it, brotha.

283
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,791
Samuel, you are such an idiot!

284
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,326
You are the worst
assistant ever.

285
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,994
And you're disgusting, Dwigt.

286
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,830
Wait, who's Dwigt?

287
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,767
Here's what we think happened.

288
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,769
Michael's sidekick,
who all through the movie

289
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:13,338
is this complete idiot
who's causing the downfall

290
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,540
of the United States...

291
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,542
was originally named Dwight.

292
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:20,478
But then Michael changed it
to Samuel L. Chang

293
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,514
using a search and replace.

294
00:11:22,516 --> 00:11:24,649
But that doesn't work
on misspelled words.

295
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:27,318
Leaving behind one Dwigt.

296
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,821
And Dwight figured it out.

297
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:31,022
Oops.

298
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,526
D-W-I-G-H-T.

299
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:35,560
Okay, you know what?

300
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,728
I am done with this.

301
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,363
That's it, the end.

302
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:40,965
Well, some of us
wanna keep reading, so...

303
00:11:40,967 --> 00:11:42,867
Uh, you don't speak
for everyone, Jim.

304
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,669
Okay, announcement.

305
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,871
My uncle bought me
some fireworks.

306
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:49,007
And anyone who wants
to see a real show

307
00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:50,742
come with me outside now.

308
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,744
That's actually a good idea.

309
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:53,878
We'll all take
a brief intermission.

310
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
Hey, are you hungry?

311
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:57,549
Yeah.
Yeah?

312
00:11:57,551 --> 00:12:00,885
And so after watching my mom
go through so much pain,

313
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,189
I decided to keep that promise
that I made to her.

314
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:06,357
And take care of her.

315
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,625
Hoo.

316
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,527
Well, this brings us to Jan.

317
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,695
Truth or dare.

318
00:12:10,697 --> 00:12:12,330
Tell us about your divorce.

319
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:13,765
Oh, no, Michael.
Michael, Michael.

320
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:16,067
Do, do. Michael, please.
No really.

321
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:17,802
Oh, hey.
So you're not gonna play.

322
00:12:17,804 --> 00:12:20,171
She's not playing. She's not
playing the game. That's not fair.

323
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,506
We'd been fighting for a while.

324
00:12:21,508 --> 00:12:22,574
He didn't want kids.

325
00:12:22,576 --> 00:12:23,675
I knew that going into it.

326
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:25,276
But he also knew that I did.

327
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,911
So I guess I thought
that he would change his mind.

328
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,480
He thought that I
would change mine.

329
00:12:28,482 --> 00:12:30,148
You didn't.

330
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,916
I was stupid.

331
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:35,687
No.
No, you were not stupid.

332
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:36,955
Gould was stupid, right?

333
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:37,956
That's right.

334
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:39,958
You were really brave.

335
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,193
I mean, you put
your arms out there.

336
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,195
You slit your wrist.

337
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,598
You said, "World, this is
my blood, it's red.

338
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,901
Just like yours,
so love me."

339
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,938
I had plans
to meet a friend tonight.

340
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,440
Which I had to cancel.

341
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,142
But this is cool too.

342
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,943
I'm not a complainer.

343
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:06,718
Wow.
For the bugs.

344
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,786
Nice.

345
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,790
That's excellent
because bugs love...

346
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,158
my famous grilled cheese
sandwich.

347
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,194
Yes!
Nice.

348
00:13:16,196 --> 00:13:18,997
I can't remember the last time
someone made me dinner.

349
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,336
Whoa!

350
00:13:25,338 --> 00:13:27,705
Yeah!
Whoo! Whoo!

351
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:32,577
Yeah!
Ha!

352
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:33,611
Whoo-hoo!

353
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,947
Right down the street?
Mm-hmm.

354
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,782
Kenneth Road, born and raised.

355
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,184
Spent my whole life

356
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,819
right here in Lackawanna county.

357
00:13:40,821 --> 00:13:43,254
And I do not intend on moving.

358
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:44,455
I know this place.

359
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:46,291
I know how many
hospitals we have.

360
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,893
I know how many schools we have.

361
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,028
It's home, you know?

362
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,796
I know the challenges

363
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:53,631
that this county's up against.

364
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:55,633
Here's the thing about
those discount suppliers,

365
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,768
they don't care.

366
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,504
They come in,
they undercut everything.

367
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,339
And they run us out of business.

368
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,541
And then, once we're all gone,

369
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,109
they jack up the prices.
I know.

370
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,211
It's bad.
It's terrible.

371
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:08,646
It is... your know what?
It really is.

372
00:14:08,648 --> 00:14:10,048
Uh...

373
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,217
I don't know.

374
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,452
I guess I could give you guys
our business,

375
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:16,154
but you have
to meet me halfway, okay?

376
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:19,224
Because they're expecting me
to make cuts.

377
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,727
Well, corporate's gonna
go ballistic,

378
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,998
but you think we could, Jan?

379
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,069
So, I guess I'll see you in...

380
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,270
10 hours.

381
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:34,138
What are you gonna do
with your time off?

382
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,607
Travel.
Yeah.

383
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,276
I've been looking forward to it.

384
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,813
It's gonna be...
really nice.

385
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,982
I'm gonna find myself.

386
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,416
You have new music?

387
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,486
Yeah.
Definitely.

388
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:00,565
See ya!
Bye!

389
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,000
Good-bye!

390
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,669
Thanks.

391
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,038
Yes!
We did it.

392
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,107
We got it!
Nailed it, nailed it!

393
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,809
Come here.

394
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,346
I am really... thrilled.

395
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,095
Let's go.

396
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,330
What?
Let's go.

397
00:15:32,332 --> 00:15:34,299
Go and... okay.
Where are we going?

398
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:35,667
Doesn't matter.

399
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:38,236
Goin' to the go-go.

400
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:39,904
Okay.

401
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,150
Michael?

402
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:01,092
Michael?

403
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:05,630
Michael?

404
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,039
His car's not
in the parking lot.

405
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,741
I should check
the accident reports.

406
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,045
Who's this?

407
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,982
Jan?

408
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,403
Morning, Pam.

409
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:47,438
Hey.

410
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,641
No, nothing happened.

411
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:55,013
I swear!

412
00:16:55,015 --> 00:16:56,481
Nothing happened.

413
00:16:56,483 --> 00:17:00,918
What... I'm totally
being serious.

414
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:03,788
A gentleman does not
kiss and tell.

415
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:06,524
And neither do I.

416
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,592
I'm...

417
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:09,560
No, seriously, guys, I'm not...

418
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:12,330
I don't wanna go into it at all.

419
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,198
It's off limits.

420
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,301
Fine, I took her back
to her hotel,

421
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:18,770
and we made out
for a little while.

422
00:17:18,772 --> 00:17:20,338
It was great.

423
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,606
I mean, she told me
about her divorce.

424
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,940
We talked for about five hours.

425
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,243
She fell asleep on my arm.

426
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,150
Hello, Dwight.

427
00:17:32,152 --> 00:17:33,184
Did you do her?

428
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:35,053
Who?

429
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,121
Jan Levinson-Gould.

430
00:17:37,123 --> 00:17:41,359
Uh, no, no, no Gould.

431
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:42,393
Did you do her?

432
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,395
This is none of your affair.

433
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:45,563
Because she is your boss.

434
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:46,564
And she is your boss.

435
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,332
And she is a woman.

436
00:17:48,334 --> 00:17:54,138
She is a strong, soft,
thoughtful, sexy woman.

437
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,673
And you know what?

438
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:56,874
I don't think I can sit here

439
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:59,043
and let you
talk about her that way

440
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,978
without me defending her honor.

441
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,648
Jan, I defend your honor.

442
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,715
Is that all?

443
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,323
Jan didn't come back
for her car last night.

444
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:14,292
What?

445
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,594
Could it be
that Agent Michael Scarn

446
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,429
has finally found
his Catherine Zeta?

447
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,565
Oh, I don't know...

448
00:18:22,402 --> 00:18:24,535
Oh, my God.
This is Jan's cell.

449
00:18:24,537 --> 00:18:25,670
No way.

450
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:28,906
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

451
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,542
I know we have to register

452
00:18:31,544 --> 00:18:34,479
as a consensual
sexual relationship with HR.

453
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,015
My question, do I do it
as the man,

454
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:39,617
does she do it as my superior?

455
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,052
I don't know.

456
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,421
That leads to other issues
that we may have

457
00:18:43,423 --> 00:18:45,323
in our relationship.

458
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:46,457
It's, uh...

459
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,925
Excuse me.

460
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,160
Hello?

461
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:52,330
Hi.
Just talking about you.

462
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,998
The camera.
No.

463
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,066
Uh-huh.

464
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,101
How's traffic?

465
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:58,369
I miss you.
What?

466
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:01,038
Okay.

467
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,812
Well, if it was a mistake,
it was a wonderful mistake.

468
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,818
No.
Just...

469
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,120
No, I did not intentionally
get you drunk.

470
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:19,891
Mm-hmm.

471
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,460
No, no.

472
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,295
This is just a fight.

473
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:25,830
This is just a first fight
of many fights

474
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:28,466
we're gonna have.

475
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:30,935
Right.

476
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:32,203
No.

477
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,704
You... I don't understand.

478
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,573
You wanna see other people.

479
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:37,008
Only other people.

480
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,809
Wha... okay.

481
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:40,378
I think you're still
a little bit drunk.

482
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,979
Excuse me.
Excuse me?

483
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,283
I think you're sti... yes.

484
00:19:45,285 --> 00:19:46,617
Why don't you just
come back here?

485
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,252
We can go to the hotel.

486
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,587
Have a few drinks.

487
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,589
No, I didn't slip you something!

488
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,625
Some might even say we had
our first date last night.

489
00:19:54,627 --> 00:19:56,861
Oh, really?
Really.

490
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,262
Why might some say that?

491
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:02,366
'Cause there was dinner.
By candlelight.

492
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:05,570
Dinner and a show
if you include Michael's movie.

493
00:20:05,572 --> 00:20:09,006
And there was
dancing and fireworks.

494
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:10,041
Pretty good date.

495
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,275
We didn't dance.

496
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,778
You're right, we didn't dance.

497
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,780
It was more like... swaying.

498
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,549
But still romantic.

499
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,151
Swaying isn't dancing.

500
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:25,890
At least I didn't leave you
at a high school hockey game.

501
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,064
I have some faxes to get out.

502
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:37,001
Oh, come on.
Pam, I'm...

503
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:40,471
Okay, we didn't dance.

504
00:20:40,473 --> 00:20:42,940
And I was totally joking,
anyway.

505
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,976
I mean, it's not really
a date if the girl

506
00:20:44,978 --> 00:20:46,944
goes home to her fiancÃ©.

507
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,580
Right?
