1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,135
So...
I'm happy to be here.

2
00:00:03,137 --> 00:00:05,170
It's very nice
to see all of you.

3
00:00:05,172 --> 00:00:06,572
You're all looking well.

4
00:00:06,574 --> 00:00:08,374
Today's a Women
in the Workplace thing.

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:10,442
Jan's coming in from corporate

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:12,878
to talk to all the women
about, um...

7
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:15,848
I don't really know what.

8
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,683
But Michael's not allowed in.

9
00:00:17,685 --> 00:00:19,618
She said that about five times.

10
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,255
Women today, though we have
the same options as men,

11
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:26,358
we often face a very different
set of obstacles...

12
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,394
in getting there, so...

13
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,628
Hey, what's going on?

14
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,230
Michael, I...
Yeah, you know what?

15
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,531
I thought we agreed...
I thought about it.

16
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:34,199
I just have few things
I wanna say.

17
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,402
What are you doing?

18
00:00:36,404 --> 00:00:37,703
Just hear me out.

19
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,638
What is more important
than quality?

20
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,540
Equality.

21
00:00:41,542 --> 00:00:43,976
Now, studies show
that today's woman,

22
00:00:43,978 --> 00:00:46,045
the Ally McBeal woman,
as I call her,

23
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,479
is at a crossroads.

24
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:49,314
Michael...
And... no, just, I...

25
00:00:49,316 --> 00:00:51,216
You have come a long way, baby.

26
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,317
But I just...

27
00:00:52,319 --> 00:00:54,620
just wanna keep it
within reason.

28
00:00:54,622 --> 00:00:56,121
They did this up in Albany...

29
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:58,223
You are not allowed in... And they
ended up turning the break room

30
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,792
into a lactation room,
which is disgusting.

31
00:00:59,794 --> 00:01:01,727
Now you're really
not allowed in this session.

32
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,128
Well, I'm their boss,
so I feel like...

33
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,696
I'm your boss.

34
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,936
Anybody want any coffee
or anything?

35
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:11,937
We're fine, Michael.

36
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:12,971
We just need you
to leave, please.

37
00:01:12,973 --> 00:01:14,706
Women in the workplace.

38
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,975
Yeah, translation:

39
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,877
I have been banned
from my own conference room

40
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,080
so that Jan can talk in secret
to all the girls.

41
00:01:21,082 --> 00:01:23,415
Oh, sorry.
"Women of the Workplace."

42
00:01:23,417 --> 00:01:24,616
About what?
I don't know.

43
00:01:24,618 --> 00:01:27,619
Clothes, me...

44
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,720
Ick.

45
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,522
Ladies, I am so,

46
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,957
so sorry.

47
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,526
Can we... start again?
We were on such a roll.

48
00:01:34,528 --> 00:01:36,562
I-I really apologize for that.
Jan.

49
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:37,696
Yes, Pam?

50
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,897
Michael's still at the door.

51
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,099
Michael!

52
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:15,067
So one obstacle
is how assertiveness

53
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,503
is perceived differently
in men and women.

54
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:20,405
Men who are assertive
tend to be admired.

55
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,375
They're called...
anyone?

56
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:25,177
That's a terrible idea.

57
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:26,845
What is?

58
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:28,480
Them in there all together.

59
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:29,948
They stay in there too long,

60
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,718
they're gonna get
on the same cycle.

61
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,486
Wreak havoc on our plumbing.

62
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:37,956
Everyone, guys...

63
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,124
Circle up, please.

64
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:41,193
Come on over.
Bring your chairs.

65
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:43,729
Toby, come on over.

66
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:46,665
You're a guy... too.
Sort of.

67
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,800
Let's do this.

68
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:50,269
Well, first of all,

69
00:02:50,271 --> 00:02:52,304
I, uh, just wanna
warm up a little bit.

70
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:53,338
Let's just clap.

71
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,007
Let's just clap.
Ready?

72
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:57,009
Yeah!

73
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:59,244
Yeah! That's what
I'm talkin' about!

74
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,846
I don't know what you're
doing here, Michael.

75
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:03,549
Just having a little
guys in the workplace thing.

76
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:06,852
Why can't boys play with dolls?

77
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,022
Why does society

78
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,457
force us to use urinals

79
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,293
when sitting down
is far more comfortable?

80
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,061
Can you please do this
somewhere else, Michael?

81
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,763
We have nowhere else, Jan.

82
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:19,064
This...

83
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:20,532
We could do it in the warehouse.

84
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,334
Dwight, excellent idea.
Go to the warehouse.

85
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:24,102
Okay, fine.
Be actually perfect.

86
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,404
Perfect!
You know what?

87
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:28,674
There is another side
to this place, gentlemen.

88
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,576
And I know we all love

89
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:33,212
our cushy jobs and our fun,
exciting office.

90
00:03:33,214 --> 00:03:35,214
But do you realize
that underneath us

91
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:36,715
there is another world.

92
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,383
The warehouse world.

93
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:41,653
A world that is teeming
with sweat and dirt

94
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:43,355
and life.

95
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,324
Life.

96
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:47,025
The bowels of the office.

97
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:48,427
These guys are down there.

98
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:51,196
They are real men
doing real man's work.

99
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:55,033
We are going to learn
how a warehouse works.

100
00:03:57,036 --> 00:03:58,904
Oh, I think this is gonna
work out great.

101
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,506
Because managing the warehouse

102
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,475
is a very important
part of my job.

103
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,877
And I haven't been there
in months.

104
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,838
Remember on Lost,
when they met the Others?

105
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,742
I'm so sorry about that.

106
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,977
Um, so where were we?

107
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,779
Pam, are you okay
taking notes then?

108
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:41,913
Mm-hmm.
Please?

109
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:44,016
Yeah.
Thank you very much.

110
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,784
So let's meet the warehouse!

111
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:48,387
Let's get some shots.

112
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:50,122
Pan around there.

113
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:53,392
This is Darrell,
one of our warehouse staff.

114
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:56,295
Darrell, what is
your biggest fear?

115
00:04:56,297 --> 00:04:58,263
My biggest fear is that
someone will distract us

116
00:04:58,265 --> 00:04:59,931
from getting all
the shipments out on time.

117
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,999
You know what?

118
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:02,367
Darrell is actually
the foreman here,

119
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:04,636
and not Roy, which is cool.

120
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,371
There's Roy, ridin' the big rig!

121
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,674
Um, so Roy is actually
going to be marrying Pam

122
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,542
sometime this summer.

123
00:05:10,544 --> 00:05:12,878
And, uh, she's our receptionist.

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,546
Sort of a BrAngelina thing.

125
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:15,947
Why?

126
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,117
BrAnangelina is
the Brad Pitt and Angelina.

127
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:21,086
I don't understand.
Roy... Roy and Pam.

128
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,454
It's a Ram.

129
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:23,622
It's a Ram thing.

130
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:26,925
I bet Roy heard about
you liking Pam.

131
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,093
I bet he'll try

132
00:05:28,095 --> 00:05:30,295
to beat you up.

133
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:31,930
Thanks for
the heads-up, Kev.

134
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:34,366
I got your back if he does.

135
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,104
But try to stay out of it.

136
00:05:40,374 --> 00:05:41,807
Just in case there's
somebody down here

137
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:43,008
who shouldn't be.

138
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,543
A little Good Will Hunting
situation.

139
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,378
All right, troops.

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,715
This is... an important day.
A big day.

141
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,750
Now, you may

142
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:56,121
look around and see
two groups here.

143
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,856
White-collar, blue-collar.

144
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,257
But I don't see it that way.

145
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,325
And you know why not?

146
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:03,795
Because I am collar-blind.

147
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:06,832
Why don't we go around the table

148
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,000
and all say something
that we know we're good at.

149
00:06:09,002 --> 00:06:12,437
I will start.
I am good at public speaking.

150
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,740
Hi, I'm Meredith,
and I'm an al...

151
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:16,742
Good at supplier relations.

152
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,210
Great.
Phyllis.

153
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,278
Um, I'm good at computer stuff.

154
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,148
E-mails, um, spreadsheets,
all that.

155
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,149
Really?

156
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,084
I don't know.
I thought that...

157
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,386
No, okay, stop.

158
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,920
You know, I've seen
some of your spreadsheets.

159
00:06:28,922 --> 00:06:30,021
And I almost always...
Really?

160
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,323
I thought they were pretty...

161
00:06:31,325 --> 00:06:33,225
I don't know how I fit in
with these women.

162
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,227
Here.

163
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:36,928
Or with Jan.

164
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:38,897
Um, I mean, we get along great.

165
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,232
Fine.

166
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,502
Um... I guess the person
I have the most in common with

167
00:06:43,504 --> 00:06:45,303
is...

168
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:47,005
Jim.

169
00:06:47,007 --> 00:06:48,340
Halpert.

170
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:49,608
Hey, uh,

171
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,709
I, uh, you know.

172
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:52,577
Heard there's a rumor
going around about,

173
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:54,479
you know, you used
to have a crush on Pam.

174
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:55,514
Oh, no, no, no.

175
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,748
No, no.
No, it's cool.

176
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,849
'Cause I know you're a good guy,

177
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:58,884
and I know that that crush

178
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,286
ended a long time ago,
so, you know.

179
00:07:01,288 --> 00:07:02,821
We're cool, right?

180
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:05,624
Yeah.
No, yeah, definitely.

181
00:07:05,626 --> 00:07:06,758
You know, it's great with me,

182
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,026
'cause that way...

183
00:07:08,028 --> 00:07:09,461
I'm glad she has
a friend at work

184
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:10,662
she can get through
the day with.

185
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:12,164
That way she's not all,
"Bah, bah, bah, bah,"

186
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,231
you know, when she gets home.

187
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,966
Yeah, I like talking to her too.

188
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,902
So, uh...
we're cool, right?

189
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,737
Yes. Yeah.

190
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:19,771
Good.
All right.

191
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,540
Cool, man.
Sweet.

192
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:30,115
Hey, Mike, look.

193
00:07:30,117 --> 00:07:32,451
How about we go
upstairs, too, you know?

194
00:07:32,453 --> 00:07:33,819
Learn how an office works.

195
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:35,454
Oh, well... We can both
switch places for the day.

196
00:07:35,456 --> 00:07:37,055
Okay, yeah, you know what?

197
00:07:37,057 --> 00:07:38,824
I don't... you're...

198
00:07:38,826 --> 00:07:40,358
My job sucks compared to this.

199
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,227
I don't think you'd like it up there.
Good experience.

200
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,062
Guys! You wanna start
unloading the truck?

201
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:48,934
Okay, let's go.
Step up.

202
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:50,936
Check this out.

203
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:52,838
Look at that.
Look at that.

204
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,972
Ba boop!

205
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,207
"Hello, how are..."

206
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:56,575
Okay.

207
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,745
That's great.

208
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:02,547
That is good stuff.

209
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,184
In five years, I'd like
to be five years sober.

210
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,286
That is an excellent goal.

211
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:09,955
4 1/2.

212
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:11,556
I'll tell you one thing.

213
00:08:11,558 --> 00:08:13,492
I am not gonna be
one of those women

214
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,727
schlepping her kids
around in a minivan.

215
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,529
Great. Uh-huh.

216
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:20,365
I want an SUV
with three rows of seats.

217
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,867
That would be great.

218
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,134
Well, I'll be honest.
One of the goals

219
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,336
of these women's seminars

220
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,904
is to feel out if there's
any standouts.

221
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,740
Women who could be a valuable
addition to our corporate life.

222
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,513
Michael wants us to bond.

223
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,114
So we need topics
for conversation.

224
00:08:36,116 --> 00:08:37,716
Ponies.

225
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:38,783
No.

226
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:39,918
How about rainbows?

227
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,286
No.

228
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,387
Flowers.

229
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,555
That's dangerous, Michael.

230
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,723
Come on, get down from there.

231
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:45,724
You're gonna hurt yourself.

232
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,791
Mike...
Stand clear.

233
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:47,993
Mike, get off
of the lift, please!

234
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,127
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Come on, now.

235
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,595
I'm fine.

236
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:53,431
Would you... look.

237
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:55,033
Oh, oh, oh!

238
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:00,772
We'll get somebody
to clean that up.

239
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:03,375
We're the ones that
gotta clean that up!

240
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:04,943
Damn it, Michael!

241
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:08,480
We have to have
this thing serviced.

242
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,182
So, guys' gripe session.

243
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,250
Here we are.

244
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:13,685
Now, we definitely live

245
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,921
in different worlds,

246
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:18,123
but we have a lot in common.

247
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,625
We even like the same girls,

248
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,893
some of us.

249
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,061
And that's gonna happen.

250
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,229
You know, we're guys.

251
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,764
So...

252
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,666
Hey... do you
want me to go?

253
00:09:27,668 --> 00:09:29,868
No... why would I...

254
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,002
You could...

255
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:32,003
I'll go.

256
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,305
Stay or...

257
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,608
And a big,
walk-in closet.

258
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,009
Oh, that's part of my dream too.

259
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,578
Oh, me too.

260
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,713
Great. Okay.

261
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,181
And, Pam, what about you?

262
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:44,516
What is your dream?

263
00:09:44,518 --> 00:09:47,953
Well... I always
dreamed of a house

264
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:49,454
with a terrace upstairs.

265
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:51,356
Plant flowers on it,
stuff like that.

266
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,225
Since I was a girl.

267
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:55,260
Um...

268
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:57,095
More seriously, though,

269
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,164
a husband that I love.

270
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:00,165
Roy.

271
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,133
And...

272
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,135
I love to draw.

273
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,604
And I did a little in college.

274
00:10:05,606 --> 00:10:07,072
And I'd still
love to do something

275
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:09,774
where I could work with art
or graphic design in some way.

276
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,976
She's real good.

277
00:10:10,978 --> 00:10:12,944
You know, the company
is offering

278
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:15,380
a design training program
in New York.

279
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,982
Well, I have a job right now.

280
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,483
So I can't really take time off.

281
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:19,884
Well, it's...
it's only on weekends.

282
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,386
And then a few weeks
in New York.

283
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,222
But I'm sure that I could
ask corporate to help you out.

284
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,357
Well, it's just that

285
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,791
the weekends aren't good
because, um...

286
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,427
There are always a million
reasons not to do something.

287
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:35,734
Let's start with the warehouse.

288
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:38,303
What bothers you as guys?
You know?

289
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,971
My priority is safety.

290
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,006
Okay.

291
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:42,374
So it really bothers me
when somebody

292
00:10:42,376 --> 00:10:43,975
comes in here speeding around
on a lift,

293
00:10:43,977 --> 00:10:45,110
playing with it like a toy.

294
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,444
It kind of gets
under my skin, okay?

295
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:48,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shh, shh.

296
00:10:48,281 --> 00:10:49,481
Uh-uh, don't...
don't shush me.

297
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,882
I... that was just...

298
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:52,117
That bothers me too.
I was breathing.

299
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:53,952
Pam shushes me.
It drives me crazy.

300
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:55,654
I hate shushing, you know?
That's the thing.

301
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,455
What b... okay.
What is our...

302
00:10:57,457 --> 00:11:00,358
beef as... human men.

303
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,227
You know, that's a good
question, Hasselhoff.

304
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,564
Okay.
What bugs us?

305
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,599
All right, good.

306
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,200
Guys raggin' on each other.

307
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:12,404
That's what guys do.
And we love it.

308
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:15,040
All right, let's talk about...

309
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,474
clothing.

310
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:18,343
I'm excited about today.

311
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:20,578
I love girl talk.

312
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,447
Dress for the job you want,

313
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:24,015
not the job you have.

314
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,350
All right, you can
use your clothing

315
00:11:25,352 --> 00:11:26,985
to send a message
about your ambitions

316
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:30,655
by wearing clothes that reflect
what you aspire to be.

317
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,624
I'm not gaining anything
from this seminar.

318
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,459
I'm a professional woman.

319
00:11:34,461 --> 00:11:35,960
The head of accounting.

320
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:38,430
I'm in the healthiest
relationship of my life.

321
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,800
I just think it's insulting
that Jan thinks we need this.

322
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:45,770
And apparently...
judging from her outfit...

323
00:11:45,772 --> 00:11:47,806
Jan aspires to be a whore.

324
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:50,775
I hate it when girls insist

325
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:52,610
on taking them out
to restaurants

326
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,279
every weekend night,
and then they're like,

327
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,214
"When are we gonna
go on a date date?"

328
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,482
Oh, I hate that, too, man.

329
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:58,583
Exactly!

330
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,919
That sucks so hard.

331
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:03,088
And then they make you drive 'em
to church the next morning.

332
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:05,857
Like, gas ain't free!

333
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,926
Yeah, on our salaries, man,

334
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,027
what do they expect, you know?

335
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,462
What, "take us
out every weekend"?

336
00:12:10,464 --> 00:12:11,663
You know what I mean?

337
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,331
We're not millionaires.
I feel you.

338
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,733
No, you don't.
You don't feel us.

339
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:16,568
How can you?
You... you know what?

340
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,969
Not literally.

341
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:19,170
You say we're the same,

342
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,572
but we get compensated
very differently.

343
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,173
Yes. We work the
same hours as you,

344
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,942
and you just said
we work a lot harder.

345
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:25,577
Uh, you do, so...

346
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,978
But we get paid a lot less.

347
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,580
Nn... yy...
Word.

348
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:29,881
Like, next to no benefits.

349
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,182
I know.
God, what is that?!

350
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,317
Exactly!

351
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:34,085
It blows, it blows, man!

352
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:35,220
You know, this would not happen

353
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:36,354
if we had a union.

354
00:12:36,356 --> 00:12:37,789
That's what I'm talking about.

355
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,258
Yeah... no. Absolutely,
that's what we need.

356
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,260
Man, see, that's what
I been sayin', man.

357
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,995
We need to do this finally.

358
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,396
You know what?
Is that necessary?

359
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,266
'Cause you already sort of
have a union of guys.

360
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,768
It's more than necessary, Mike.

361
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,771
We need this.
Roy... you still have that card

362
00:12:52,773 --> 00:12:54,038
from the dock worker's union?

363
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,673
Dock workers?
Man, hook him up.

364
00:12:55,675 --> 00:12:56,741
Come on, man!

365
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:58,042
Yeah.

366
00:12:58,044 --> 00:12:59,377
You know what, I think, uh...

367
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,578
Problem is the chicks.

368
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,680
Union, yeah! The
problem is the chicks.

369
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,682
And you gotta blame them.

370
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:07,819
Are you with us, Mike?

371
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:09,654
Yeah, s...

372
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:11,556
Welcome to the warehouse.

373
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,624
Mi-chael!

374
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,593
Mi-chael! Mi-chael! Mi-chael!

375
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,497
Another issue
is inequality of pay

376
00:13:19,499 --> 00:13:20,865
between men and women.

377
00:13:20,867 --> 00:13:22,667
I'm sure that all of you
have dealt with that before.

378
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,736
This is important.

379
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:25,770
Ladies, take a breather.

380
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,640
Jan, I, uh...

381
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:31,042
wanted...

382
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:32,310
Can I help you?

383
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,648
Um, I wanted to say
that the guys downstairs

384
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,383
are thinking about
forming a union.

385
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:40,285
And they have some good points.
What? A union?

386
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:41,452
Don't get hysterical.
I'm not.

387
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,689
Part of my job
is knowing how to talk to women.

388
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,725
Let's... be...
rational... here.

389
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,894
What are the pros,
what are the cons?

390
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,263
The cons are that everyone
will lose their job, Michael.

391
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:54,499
Everyone.
Office, warehouse.

392
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:58,770
What do you think
the... pros... are... here?

393
00:13:58,772 --> 00:14:01,439
Don't talk to me
that way, please.

394
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:04,409
Just... they're gonna
wanna hear this from you.

395
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,044
Oh, you got yourself
into this, Michael,

396
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:08,413
so you get yourself out. Well,
we're bonding down there.

397
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,781
I just don't wanna
have to tell them something

398
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:10,815
they're not gonna wanna hear!

399
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:11,950
Now who's getting hysterical?

400
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:13,117
Okay... Come on Jan.

401
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,452
After all we've been through.

402
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,787
Michael, Michael...
We have history.

403
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,388
We have a history.
Michael.

404
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,590
Between us.

405
00:14:18,592 --> 00:14:20,291
Don't say another word.

406
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,161
Get... yourself...
down... stairs.

407
00:14:23,163 --> 00:14:24,495
I'm just saying
that we have something...

408
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,264
Okay, whatever.

409
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,768
You know what?

410
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,170
We could get this done
a lot quicker

411
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:33,972
if we formed
a type of assembly line.

412
00:14:33,974 --> 00:14:37,375
This here is
a run-out-the-clock situation.

413
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:40,144
Just like upstairs.

414
00:14:40,146 --> 00:14:41,980
Sports metaphors

415
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:43,281
are one of the ways
women feel left out

416
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,449
of the language of the office.

417
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,017
Now, I know this
might sound silly,

418
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,619
but many women
ask to go over it.

419
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,721
So... fumble means...

420
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,456
Mistake. Slip. Right.

421
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,958
Par for the course
is a golf term.

422
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,693
It means right on track.

423
00:14:55,695 --> 00:14:58,529
Uh, below par means worse.

424
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,865
Wait, that should mean better.
That doesn't make sense.

425
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,200
What about second base?

426
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:05,970
Like if Michael said
he got to second base with you?

427
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,839
Does that mean you
had closed a deal?

428
00:15:07,841 --> 00:15:09,073
Excuse me?

429
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,242
I mean, that's
a baseball term, right?

430
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,311
I don't know what...
Michael was...

431
00:15:13,313 --> 00:15:14,913
talking about, I don't know.

432
00:15:14,915 --> 00:15:16,314
Like, you went to Chili's,

433
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,849
and he got
to second base with you.

434
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,183
Excuse me.

435
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:20,752
Kelly, I don't know
what Michael was talking about.

436
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:23,354
He just told everybody,
and I just wanna know...

437
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,422
Hey.

438
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,690
Hey!

439
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,058
How's it going down there?

440
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,593
It's a complete d...
Well, actually,

441
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,794
it's exactly
what you'd expect, so...

442
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,929
Right.

443
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,096
How are the girls?
Good.

444
00:15:32,098 --> 00:15:34,666
We watched a video about
our changing bodies.

445
00:15:34,668 --> 00:15:35,900
Did you really?

446
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:37,368
No.
Oh.

447
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,304
Almost.

448
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:42,273
Um, but, hey, um...
something kind of cool.

449
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:44,742
There's this internship
in graphic design

450
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:46,477
that Jan was telling us about.

451
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,980
She made it sound, like,
really great.

452
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,949
Nice.
Well, what's it all about?

453
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:52,850
I think you should do it.

454
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,152
That's great.

455
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:56,454
It's really cool.

456
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,824
Cold front comin' in
to the warehouse!

457
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,326
Uh-oh!

458
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,628
Better put on your ski boots!

459
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:07,932
Wooooow!

460
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:11,102
Happy New Year, Darrell!

461
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,071
Hey, Darrell!

462
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:16,174
You ever done this?

463
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,577
Are you married?

464
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:21,446
I'm divorced.

465
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,348
That must have been hard.
It was.

466
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,649
Yes.

467
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:26,584
You were probably feeling
really depressed and sad,

468
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,253
and that's why you
did that thing with Michael.

469
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,989
I think you should all spend
a little more time

470
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:33,491
thinking about your careers
and less time on personal stuff.

471
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:36,027
Mmm, I think we're all okay
with the balance we've struck.

472
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,695
At least you don't have kids.

473
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:40,098
You have no kids, right?
Thank God.

474
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,001
Okay, let's take five.
I think we could all use five.

475
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,905
How can someone
so beautiful be so sad?

476
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:52,010
Hi.

477
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:53,544
Did you take care
of the situation?

478
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:54,579
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:57,382
Yes, I...
I have... essentially...

480
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:59,217
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Yes, I've take...

481
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,452
I'm told that there's
been some interest

482
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:03,688
in forming a union,
and that Michael supported it.

483
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,757
Obviously he's not
a friend of yours,

484
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,058
because he didn't
tell you the facts.

485
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,359
So let me.

486
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,396
If there is even a whiff
of unionizing in this branch,

487
00:17:11,398 --> 00:17:13,931
I can guarantee you the branch
will be shut down like that.

488
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:15,199
They unionized in Pittsfield,

489
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:17,068
and we all know
what happened in Pittsfield.

490
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,504
It will cost each of you
a fortune in legal fees

491
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:21,272
and union dues,
and that'll be nothing

492
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:22,807
compared to the cost
of losing your jobs.

493
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,710
So I would think
long and hard before

494
00:17:25,712 --> 00:17:27,478
sacrificing your savings
and your futures

495
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,781
just to send a message.

496
00:17:29,783 --> 00:17:31,149
If you have
any further questions,

497
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:32,717
you can direct them to...

498
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:35,686
To Michael.

499
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,026
Dreams are just that.
They're dreams.

500
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,062
They help get you
through the day.

501
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:45,396
Like the thing
about the terrace.

502
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,198
It's nice.

503
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,833
But, um...
I don't know.

504
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,335
It was just something I read
in this book when I was 12.

505
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,571
Uh, the girl in the book
has a terrace

506
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,006
outside of her bedroom.

507
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,742
And she planted flowers on it.

508
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,744
And I just loved that.

509
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,813
Just always kind of
stuck with me.

510
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:04,348
So you're not doing it?

511
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,518
How did you know?

512
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,654
Why not?

513
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:12,190
Just not...
no big reason.

514
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,291
Just a bunch of little reasons.

515
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,126
Come on.

516
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,661
Roy's right.

517
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,529
There's no guarantee it's
gonna lead to anything anyway.

518
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,364
Roy said that?

519
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:24,435
What? You have
something you wanna say?

520
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:29,040
You gotta take a chance
on something sometime, Pam.

521
00:18:29,042 --> 00:18:32,076
I mean, do you wanna
be a receptionist here, always?

522
00:18:32,078 --> 00:18:33,377
Oh, excuse me!

523
00:18:33,379 --> 00:18:35,146
I'm fine with my choices.

524
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,415
You are?

525
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,150
Yeah.

526
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,886
It's impractical.

527
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:45,256
I'm not gonna...
try to get a house like that.

528
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:48,459
Um, they don't even make houses
like that in Scranton.

529
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,061
So I'm never gonna...

530
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,870
Just gonna push this over there!

531
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,141
This is not a good idea
right here.

532
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,578
Easy does it. Okay.

533
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,153
Pizza.

534
00:19:15,155 --> 00:19:17,088
Great equalizer.

535
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,891
Rich people love pizza.
Poor people love pizza.

536
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:22,360
White people love pizza.
Black people love pizza.

537
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:26,397
Do black people like pizza?

538
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,410
Hey... um...

539
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:40,745
Look, guys, I'm sorry.

540
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:43,347
Sometimes, Jan...

541
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,982
can be such a bitch.

542
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,120
Hey, watch it.
Watch it.

543
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,788
We have a relationship.

544
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,790
Thank you to our hosts.

545
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:54,292
Hey, Michael!

546
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:55,993
This ain't over.

547
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:05,970
Excellent.

548
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:07,338
Is it good to be back?
Yeah.

549
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,106
I mean,
I love the guy stuff, but...

550
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,542
to run an office,
you need men and women.

551
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:12,810
You know why?

552
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:16,480
Because you need to have
that crazy sexual tension

553
00:20:16,482 --> 00:20:18,516
to keep things interesting.

554
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:31,662
Dunder-Mifflin.
This is Pam.

555
00:20:33,198 --> 00:20:34,899
Uh, hold, please.

556
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,673
Snow angel!
Snow angel!
