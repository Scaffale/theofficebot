1
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:08,035
Not again.

2
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:10,734
Bow down
before Recyclops.

3
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:12,504
Five years ago corporate
said we had to start

4
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:14,101
a recycling program
for Earth Day,

5
00:00:14,179 --> 00:00:15,646
so Dwight took
the lead on that,

6
00:00:15,714 --> 00:00:19,707
and introduced us to a very close
friend of his named Recyclops.

7
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:22,880
Happy Earth Day, everyone.
I'm Recyclops.

8
00:00:22,954 --> 00:00:24,353
Did you know that
an old milk carton

9
00:00:24,423 --> 00:00:26,687
can be sawed in half
and used as a planter?

10
00:00:26,758 --> 00:00:29,886
<i>The next year, he
really stepped things up.</i>

11
00:00:30,562 --> 00:00:34,999
Who has put a number seven
plastic in a number four bin?

12
00:00:35,066 --> 00:00:38,593
<i>A year after that, Recyclops
really began to take shape.</i>

13
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:45,140
Recyclops will drown you
in your over-watered lawns!

14
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:48,869
Then tragedy struck Recyclops
when his fictional planet

15
00:00:48,947 --> 00:00:52,178
was attacked by some other
fictitious thing, I can't remember.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,777
Recyclops will have
his revenge!

17
00:00:56,154 --> 00:00:58,281
I think this was also the year
that he renounced Earth Day

18
00:00:58,356 --> 00:01:01,484
and vowed to destroy
the planet he once loved.

19
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,926
Oh, my God, you guys,
look! It's Recyclops!

20
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:06,759
Recyclops destroy!

21
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:13,363
Oh, is today Recyclops Day? Yes.

22
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:15,429
I thought you were killed
by Polluticon or something.

23
00:01:15,507 --> 00:01:17,236
Polluticon wishes.

24
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:21,008
That's aerosol spray. It's
terrible for the environment.

25
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,047
Humans are terrible
for the environment.

26
00:01:26,284 --> 00:01:28,115
The thing I like most
about Recyclops

27
00:01:28,186 --> 00:01:30,848
is that he's creating a
different world for our child.

28
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:31,946
Hmm.

29
00:01:32,023 --> 00:01:35,049
<i>A world where you truly
can be anything you want.</i>

30
00:01:35,126 --> 00:01:36,491
<i>God bless you,
Recyclops,</i>

31
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:38,324
<i>and your cold
robot heart.</i>

32
00:02:12,831 --> 00:02:14,924
Okay. Okay.
How about this?

33
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:17,158
That's great.

34
00:02:17,235 --> 00:02:18,964
I want it to be better
than great, Pam.

35
00:02:19,037 --> 00:02:22,495
How about I remain seated and
I just do a little bit of a nod,

36
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:24,565
sort of a humble thing?
Sure.

37
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:26,907
No. Then my face is down.
They can't see my face.

38
00:02:26,978 --> 00:02:28,240
And it looks like
you're taking a dump.

39
00:02:28,313 --> 00:02:32,113
Alan Brand who's
the CEO of the company,

40
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:33,980
if title is important
to you,

41
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:38,386
<i>has personally invited
moi to go to New York</i>

42
00:02:38,456 --> 00:02:40,048
to the shareholders'
meeting

43
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:42,593
and sit up on the stage
with the board of directors.

44
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:45,255
And at some point, they're
going to introduce me

45
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:50,063
as the most successful
branch manager that they have.

46
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:54,231
And then Michael Scott turns
and waves to the crowd.

47
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:56,699
And the crowd goes wild.

48
00:02:56,975 --> 00:03:00,274
Ladies and gentlemen,
from Scranton, Pennsylvania,

49
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:04,873
please welcome
Michael "The Machine" Scott!

50
00:03:07,686 --> 00:03:08,710
Oh.

51
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,379
Don't do the twirl.
Lose the twirl.

52
00:03:10,455 --> 00:03:12,389
Twirl sucks.
Michael, I hated the twirl.

53
00:03:12,457 --> 00:03:13,617
Hate the twirl.

54
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,922
Okay, obviously I'm not
going to do the twirl.

55
00:03:15,994 --> 00:03:17,791
I only did it because
I nailed the wave.

56
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:19,352
Yeah, good.
Don't do it.

57
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,697
I'm not going
to do the twirl, all right?

58
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,531
It's not even a twirl.
It's a spin.

59
00:03:27,606 --> 00:03:29,403
I might do the spin.

60
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:33,237
The long-term problem is bad
investments that they need to dump.

61
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:34,972
And the short-term problem
is the company

62
00:03:35,046 --> 00:03:36,707
has no cash and there's
nowhere to get it.

63
00:03:36,781 --> 00:03:39,716
Okay, Oscar. I don't need the
whole enchilada, just bullet points.

64
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:40,842
Those are
the bullet points.

65
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,409
Well, could you
condense it, please?

66
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:43,954
That's as simple
as I can make it.

67
00:03:44,022 --> 00:03:45,284
Michael, the limo's
here for you.

68
00:03:45,357 --> 00:03:46,949
It's not a limo,
it's a town car.

69
00:03:47,025 --> 00:03:48,356
Town cars are
actually better, though,

70
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,155
better torque,
better handling.

71
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:51,525
He said limousine, so...

72
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:54,622
Check it out, guys,
there's a limo down here.

73
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,729
Michael, look.

74
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,210
Oh, man!
It's a limo.

75
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,336
They sent a limo.

76
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,780
Town cars suck.
A town car

77
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:12,874
is something that a company
sends when they're in trouble.

78
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:16,284
A limousine is something
that a company sends

79
00:04:16,354 --> 00:04:19,380
when they have cause
for celebration.

80
00:04:19,891 --> 00:04:22,985
And in this case, I think
we are celebrating me.

81
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,700
Move it! Quick!

82
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,998
Wow! Wow!

83
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,038
Oh, no way!
Yeah!

84
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,606
What kind of mileage
does this baby get?

85
00:04:38,677 --> 00:04:41,544
It's like what high school
kids take to prom on TV shows.

86
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:44,275
So typical of management
to spend money on this.

87
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:46,283
Bunch of boobs!

88
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:48,819
Hate to break it to you, Oscar,
but some of us like boobs.

89
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,684
Calves.
Calves all the way.

90
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:52,052
I'm so jealous
right now.

91
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:54,887
Hey, you know who you
should be jealous of?

92
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,324
Yourself.

93
00:04:56,394 --> 00:04:59,261
Because you're invited,
and you're invited,

94
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,355
and you're invited,
and you, and you,

95
00:05:01,433 --> 00:05:02,923
and you and you and you
and you... Car seats eight.

96
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:04,298
What?
The car seats eight.

97
00:05:04,369 --> 00:05:05,666
The limo seats eight.

98
00:05:05,737 --> 00:05:08,501
Okay, then Jim and Pam
and Ryan plus a guest.

99
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:09,562
No.
No, thanks.

100
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,268
I'll use it
when you're done.

101
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:13,377
Mmm.

102
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,544
Whoa.

103
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,745
The Dunder Mifflin
stock symbol is DMI.

104
00:05:19,818 --> 00:05:21,342
Do you know what
that stands for?

105
00:05:21,419 --> 00:05:23,216
Dummies,
Morons and Idiots,

106
00:05:23,288 --> 00:05:25,916
because that's what
you'd have to be to own it.

107
00:05:26,157 --> 00:05:29,820
And as one of those idiots, I
believe the board owes me answers.

108
00:05:30,562 --> 00:05:31,654
I wish the
windows weren't tinted

109
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,721
so people could
see us in here.

110
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,631
Hey, guys, do you think anyone
might have had sex in here?

111
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,532
Definitely. Definitely. Smells like it.

112
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:40,127
Look, they got pillows.

113
00:05:40,205 --> 00:05:42,400
That, that's bigger
than my bed.

114
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:44,704
Word.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

115
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:47,206
Who's playing
with the button?

116
00:05:49,147 --> 00:05:50,910
Hey, Ryan, could you start consolidating

117
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:52,677
all our Rolodex
information into Outlook?

118
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:54,480
Doesn't seem like
there's much of a point

119
00:05:54,552 --> 00:05:55,712
if the company's
going under.

120
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,913
But if the company
doesn't go under,

121
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:58,649
then we'll finally have all
our contacts in one program.

122
00:05:58,723 --> 00:06:00,691
Company's probably going under,
though. It could go either way.

123
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,885
Seems like it's
leaning one way.

124
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,291
Maybe we should just
wait and find out.

125
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:04,385
Definitely.
Okay.

126
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:07,295
So should we wait to find out
before we start doing all this stuff?

127
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:09,560
Nah. Might as well
do it now.

128
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,172
Michael, what if somebody asks
you a question at this meeting?

129
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:17,367
Are you just
going to wave or what?

130
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,807
I will have to answer.

131
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:19,901
I'll ask you
a question.

132
00:06:19,978 --> 00:06:21,104
Make it a softball.

133
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,670
Something he can, like,
crank out of the park.

134
00:06:23,748 --> 00:06:26,842
Michael Scott, you run the most
profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin.

135
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:28,112
Yeah.
How do you do it?

136
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:31,883
No, no, that's too hard.
Say, your name is Zamboni,

137
00:06:32,257 --> 00:06:35,090
and then I will say, "Well,
we're sort of on thin ice."

138
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,218
Uh-oh!

139
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,727
I won't say that. I'll
say something like that.

140
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,391
This is your big day. Come on.

141
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:42,865
Whoo. Oh, my God. This is it.

142
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,062
Mr. Scott?
Yes.

143
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,398
I'm Laurie.
Oh, hi.

144
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:47,904
Thank you for joining us. Come with me.

145
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:50,133
Well, thank you.
And please call...

146
00:06:50,208 --> 00:06:52,176
Continue to call me
Mr. Scott.

147
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,267
Okay.

148
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:55,175
If you just want to follow me
I'll take you up to the lounge.

149
00:06:55,246 --> 00:06:58,113
Well, I guess this is as far
as I can take you guys, so...

150
00:06:58,183 --> 00:06:59,912
Good luck,
Michael. See you later.

151
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,318
Officers. Thank you.

152
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:05,413
After you, Mr. Scott.

153
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,787
Thank you.

154
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:08,516
Michael.
Hello.

155
00:07:08,593 --> 00:07:09,787
So glad you could make it. Thank you.

156
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:10,885
How was the ride?

157
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,954
Oh. It was awesome.
Very, very sublime.

158
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:16,091
I'm glad. I want to
introduce you to everyone.

159
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:18,101
Okay. First we'll start with Alan Brand.

160
00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:19,568
Alan, CEO.

161
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,832
Michael Scott,
Branch Manager, Scranton.

162
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,869
It's nice to meet you,
Michael. Nice to meet you, too.

163
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:26,274
It's an honor
and a privilege.

164
00:07:26,344 --> 00:07:29,438
Seated, we have the former
congressman, Chris O'Keefe.

165
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:30,572
Your eminence.

166
00:07:31,783 --> 00:07:34,251
For those of you with
questions, please line up

167
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,581
behind one of
the four microphones

168
00:07:35,653 --> 00:07:36,881
that have been placed
in the aisles.

169
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,547
Coming through!

170
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:56,904
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

171
00:07:57,542 --> 00:07:59,442
Damn it!

172
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:03,446
What... Okay.

173
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:08,308
I was hoping to lob Michael
a softball question early.

174
00:08:08,386 --> 00:08:10,354
I wanted to swing by
the Garment District,

175
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,719
pick up a few crates
of my shirts.

176
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:14,314
I got a shirt guy.

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,222
Would you
believe this?

178
00:08:17,295 --> 00:08:20,025
The money they spent
on this convention hall!

179
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,360
Excuse me, miss.

180
00:08:21,432 --> 00:08:24,265
Just want to take this stupid
board of directors by their necks.

181
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:25,962
This is so simple.

182
00:08:26,037 --> 00:08:27,197
Yeah.
Idiots!

183
00:08:27,272 --> 00:08:29,172
Well, you should do that.
Get in line.

184
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:32,437
Oh, what a great idea, and
lose my job. No, thank you.

185
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,644
Look, do you want to be
able to tell your grandkids

186
00:08:37,715 --> 00:08:39,012
you stood up
for yourself

187
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:42,018
during America's
biggest financial crisis?

188
00:08:43,154 --> 00:08:45,622
How is he going
to have grandkids?

189
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:48,650
You guys ever
protect the President?

190
00:08:48,726 --> 00:08:49,886
No.

191
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:54,561
What about Madonna or
Obama twins? Anybody famous?

192
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,429
Not supposed to
talk about it.

193
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:57,627
Nelly Furtado.

194
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,896
All right, guys.

195
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:01,332
Are you ready?

196
00:09:01,406 --> 00:09:02,839
Rock and roll.

197
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:26,061
<i>Dunder Mifflin is
still a strong company,</i>

198
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,394
<i>and we are poised
to come through this</i>

199
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:31,765
<i>more streamlined and
profitable than ever.</i>

200
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:36,267
This is not as much fun
as I thought it would be.

201
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,571
It was fun when we weren't
on the brink of bankruptcy.

202
00:09:38,643 --> 00:09:40,076
<i>We're going
bankrupt, you think?</i>

203
00:09:42,814 --> 00:09:44,873
They are really angry.

204
00:09:45,383 --> 00:09:48,216
<i>The shareholders need to
empower our leadership...</i>

205
00:09:48,286 --> 00:09:49,548
I'm just going to
run to the bathroom.

206
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,951
Will you save my place?
Sure.

207
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:52,580
No. He will not.

208
00:09:52,657 --> 00:09:53,749
Excuse me?

209
00:09:53,825 --> 00:09:56,919
Oh, I'm sorry. Were you raised in
a household with no consequences?

210
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,053
Lt'll just be a second.

211
00:09:58,129 --> 00:09:59,153
Oh.

212
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:01,755
If onlys and justs
were candies and nuts

213
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:04,324
<i>then every day
would be Erntedankfest.</i>

214
00:10:06,404 --> 00:10:08,065
<i>...and we're confident
there are many things</i>

215
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:10,937
<i>to be optimistic about
in Dunder Mifflin's future.</i>

216
00:10:11,109 --> 00:10:13,771
<i>And one of them is
here with us today.</i>

217
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:18,074
<i>Michael Scott,
Scranton Branch Manager.</i>

218
00:10:18,316 --> 00:10:19,374
Yes!

219
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,542
<i>In these
uncertain times,</i>

220
00:10:20,618 --> 00:10:23,451
<i>Michael has managed to
maintain steady profits</i>

221
00:10:23,521 --> 00:10:27,582
<i>from his Scranton branch.
We all thank you, Michael.</i>

222
00:10:29,694 --> 00:10:32,219
<i>Another bright spot in the
Dunder Mifflin landscape,</i>

223
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:36,232
<i>our new waste pulp
repurposing plant in Milford.</i>

224
00:10:40,238 --> 00:10:42,365
Hey, Phyllis, are you just
getting back from lunch now?

225
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,431
Mmm. Bob took me
to Capello's.

226
00:10:44,509 --> 00:10:46,067
We got a little tipsy.

227
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,168
Okay.

228
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:48,940
Shouldn't be
telling me that stuff,

229
00:10:49,013 --> 00:10:51,709
and also shouldn't be taking
two-hour lunches without telling me.

230
00:10:51,783 --> 00:10:54,650
Oh, it's okay. Michael doesn't
really care about these things.

231
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:58,519
I care about them. And I'm just
as much of a boss as Michael.

232
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:02,189
What's so funny?
I'm a co-manager.

233
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,659
That doesn't
make you a boss.

234
00:11:03,728 --> 00:11:05,923
It's not like you can
fire people or anything.

235
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:09,532
Who... How did you...
Who told you this?

236
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,397
We can't say.
Ryan.

237
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,027
Sorry. I'm plastered.

238
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:15,072
Okay, who else
has heard the rumor

239
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:17,937
that I am not as much
in charge as Michael?

240
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,376
Stuff gets around.
I don't participate.

241
00:11:25,583 --> 00:11:27,710
Who here heard it
from Ryan?

242
00:11:28,386 --> 00:11:29,512
Does an e-mail count?

243
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:30,645
Yes.

244
00:11:30,721 --> 00:11:32,245
Then, yeah.

245
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,348
I am just as much
of a boss as Michael,

246
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,655
and I can do anything
that Michael can do.

247
00:11:36,727 --> 00:11:38,092
All right?

248
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:40,790
Who here believes that I
have as much power as Michael?

249
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:49,533
I forgot I have to support
him, no matter what.

250
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,938
Close one.

251
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:52,642
These questions
are bush league.

252
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:55,008
You should get up
and say something.

253
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,309
You got to be true
to what's in there.

254
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,574
Don't be a wuss.

255
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:02,210
I've always been the guy who
can rally other people to rebel.

256
00:12:02,286 --> 00:12:05,278
In high school I organized a
walkout over standardized testing.

257
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,621
Got over 500 students
to just skip the SATs.

258
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,422
At the last second, I
chickened out, took it anyway.

259
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:13,328
Got a 1220.
Always regretted it.

260
00:12:14,065 --> 00:12:15,726
I feel lachrymose.

261
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,397
<i>Believe me, everyone
is working very hard,</i>

262
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:23,702
<i>working weekends, struggling,
trying to right the ship.</i>

263
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:24,900
You're criminals!

264
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:28,844
<i>Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.
These are not criminals.</i>

265
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:32,749
<i>They're nice. They invited
me to come here today.</i>

266
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:35,544
<i>They invited me to
their hospitality suite,</i>

267
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,487
<i>where I had free food
and it was delicious.</i>

268
00:12:38,689 --> 00:12:40,714
<i>Get this, you know
how nice they are?</i>

269
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,418
<i>They sent
a stretch limo</i>

270
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:44,620
<i>all the way to pick me up in Scranton.</i>

271
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,856
<i>Limousine?
Yes.</i>

272
00:12:46,931 --> 00:12:48,398
You're all corrupt!
You should be in jail!

273
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:53,560
<i>Quiet! Quiet, please!
Please, quiet!</i>

274
00:12:54,238 --> 00:12:58,197
<i>Quiet, please! We want
to hear your questions.</i>

275
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:02,609
Do you love her, or do
you love the idea of her?

276
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,012
I don't know, man.
I just don't know.

277
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:08,108
I've got to make an example out
of him. Should I just fire him?

278
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,881
Can you actually
fire people?

279
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:11,216
To be honest,
I don't know.

280
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:13,780
But maybe I could just yell
at him in front of people.

281
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:16,088
Well, I can't really imagine
you yelling at anyone.

282
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,094
Oh, I yell.
You've heard me yell.

283
00:13:18,162 --> 00:13:20,426
Okay. I've
heard you exclaim.

284
00:13:20,498 --> 00:13:23,865
Like the time you said, "Hey,
look, we parked over here!"

285
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:24,959
Well, that was
apple-picking day.

286
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:26,196
There was no need
to yell that day.

287
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,397
You know, I was just
excited to find the car.

288
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:30,667
Perfect end
to a perfect day.

289
00:13:31,309 --> 00:13:33,504
Well, you'll
figure it out.

290
00:13:36,414 --> 00:13:39,281
<i>Okay, we're going to take
a 15-minute break,</i>

291
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,284
<i>and then we're going to
answer more questions.</i>

292
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:42,512
You haven't said
anything yet

293
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,054
and we're headed
for bankruptcy!

294
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:45,678
Yeah!
Yeah!

295
00:13:45,756 --> 00:13:48,418
<i>Yeah, well, that's not going to
happen. That's not going to happen.</i>

296
00:13:48,492 --> 00:13:50,084
<i>We'll be back
with some answers.</i>

297
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,356
- What?
- What answers?

298
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,490
<i>Okay, I know that
you're mad at me</i>

299
00:13:55,566 --> 00:13:56,624
<i>and you're mad
at all of them...</i>

300
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:58,532
How are you going to
fix the company?

301
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:00,503
<i>Okay. All right.</i>

302
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,638
<i>All right.</i>

303
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,939
<i>We are going to go out
there during this break</i>

304
00:14:07,011 --> 00:14:09,844
<i>and we're going to
come back with a plan.</i>

305
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:11,808
<i>We're going to come back
with a plan for you.</i>

306
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:13,873
<i>It's a 45-day plan.</i>

307
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:17,077
<i>Forty-five days to
get us back on track.</i>

308
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:20,347
<i>Forty-five points.</i>

309
00:14:21,025 --> 00:14:24,017
<i>It's a 45-day, 45-point,
one point per day,</i>

310
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:26,256
<i>we get to 45 points,
we're back in business!</i>

311
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:31,300
<i>And you can take
that to the bank!</i>

312
00:14:31,736 --> 00:14:33,226
<i>And, limo lady,</i>

313
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:36,503
<i>we are going completely
carbon-neutral!</i>

314
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,277
<i>I love you, New York!</i>

315
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:03,059
<i>You! You!</i>

316
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:06,069
Hey, Ryan,
how's it going?

317
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,803
Here's the thing.

318
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:10,841
I've tried it, like, five
different ways in my head and...

319
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:14,537
Oh. Got one.
I'm such a perfectionist

320
00:15:14,945 --> 00:15:18,278
that I'd kind of rather not do it
at all than do a crappy version.

321
00:15:18,349 --> 00:15:20,840
Simple data entry, though. So
there's really only one way to do it.

322
00:15:20,918 --> 00:15:22,852
Sounds like you have a
really specific vision for it.

323
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,353
Do you want to maybe
just take a whack at it?

324
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:25,650
You know what?
What?

325
00:15:25,723 --> 00:15:26,985
I think I know the problem. Great.

326
00:15:27,058 --> 00:15:28,184
I think
you seem distracted.

327
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:29,590
Yep, that is
the problem.

328
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,957
And you know what, I
came up with something

329
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,359
that I think is
really gonna help.

330
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,022
Well, I'm glad you're
finally being proactive, Jim.

331
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:36,258
I am, too.
Let me show you.

332
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:40,970
Wow, things are
really picking up.

333
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:42,335
What was that about?

334
00:15:42,406 --> 00:15:43,464
What?

335
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,133
You were supposed to wave.

336
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:47,074
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.

337
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:48,509
What are we supposed
to tell them now?

338
00:15:48,579 --> 00:15:49,910
Okay, you've dug us
quite a hole.

339
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,380
We tell them the plan.
Right?

340
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,849
There is no plan.

341
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:58,817
Here's what
we're going to do.

342
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,756
The 45-day thing that I
outlined, we go with that.

343
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,325
Day 45, company saved.

344
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,487
Day 44, go,
what have we got?

345
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:06,587
We have 15 minutes.

346
00:16:06,664 --> 00:16:07,824
Excuse me?

347
00:16:07,898 --> 00:16:10,025
Just whatever comes
to mind, shout it out.

348
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,261
Who the hell
is this guy?

349
00:16:11,335 --> 00:16:14,668
I am the guy
who roused that crowd.

350
00:16:14,739 --> 00:16:15,899
Yes.
Got them on their feet.

351
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:17,964
They were so happy down there. Yes. Yes.

352
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:19,441
Who cares?

353
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:23,543
Okay. All right.

354
00:16:24,181 --> 00:16:27,844
Well, I know a guy, this
Mexican guy, he's a math wiz.

355
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,419
He knows economics as well
as he knows bullfighting.

356
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,720
And I am going to
call in a little favor.

357
00:16:34,792 --> 00:16:36,316
No, no, no.
Don't call anybody, Michael.

358
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:37,691
Well, I'm texting him, so.

359
00:16:37,762 --> 00:16:40,788
Please do not text
anybody now, Michael.

360
00:16:42,266 --> 00:16:43,631
It's done.

361
00:16:49,006 --> 00:16:50,030
Oh.

362
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,974
There he is. Come on in, come on in.

363
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:54,806
Gentlemen, I would
like you to meet Oscar.

364
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:56,278
Come on in,
don't be shy.

365
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,372
This is Oscar Martinez.

366
00:16:58,582 --> 00:17:01,210
Oscar, why don't you come
over here? Let me present you.

367
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,843
Step up,
step up there.

368
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,186
Oscar is an accountant
extraordinaire at the Scranton branch,

369
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,486
and he has
a wonderful idea

370
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,426
as to how to get us out of
this murky, murky situation.

371
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,587
Take it away.

372
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:19,362
I think this is
really going to help.

373
00:17:19,437 --> 00:17:21,405
If you could just
hold up here one second.

374
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,905
Hey, guys, just
a quick announcement.

375
00:17:22,973 --> 00:17:24,463
If I could have
everyone's attention.

376
00:17:24,542 --> 00:17:27,340
Just figured you needed a place
where you could concentrate.

377
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:29,572
And not be bothered
by bothering people.

378
00:17:29,647 --> 00:17:30,671
Okay.

379
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:32,340
Let me show you
what I mean.

380
00:17:32,416 --> 00:17:35,715
Your new office.
How great is that, right?

381
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:37,879
For a job well done.
Well, not done.

382
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:41,119
I will do my work
right now.

383
00:17:41,192 --> 00:17:42,591
I will stay late tonight. Right.

384
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:45,128
I'm very sorry about
everything.

385
00:17:45,196 --> 00:17:46,322
You're a good kid.
You know what,

386
00:17:46,397 --> 00:17:47,830
it gets bigger
once you're in there.

387
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,195
Enjoy it.

388
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,732
Is there Internet?

389
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,641
Tell them what you
told me. This is genius.

390
00:18:07,117 --> 00:18:09,642
Tell them about
the cash flow

391
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,154
and the dumping of
properties and...

392
00:18:13,924 --> 00:18:17,087
This is all good.
It's all good stuff.

393
00:18:18,162 --> 00:18:19,527
Lay it on them.

394
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:22,498
I feel,
as does Mr. Scott,

395
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:24,363
that we are in
the best of hands,

396
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:26,067
capable hands.

397
00:18:26,136 --> 00:18:28,866
That wasn't what
you were saying to me.

398
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,871
He was much more
articulate

399
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,933
and that was better,
much better.

400
00:18:34,011 --> 00:18:36,536
I think this has gone
very well and I thank you.

401
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:37,774
Okay.

402
00:18:38,816 --> 00:18:40,340
Oh.

403
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:43,784
Hey, hey.
What were you doing?

404
00:18:43,854 --> 00:18:45,481
Michael, I didn't ask
to come up here.

405
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,319
Wow, man!
What?

406
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:48,858
That was embarrassing.

407
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,291
For me.
For me, too.

408
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:52,625
For you and me?
You embarrassed me.

409
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:58,062
Well...

410
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:02,630
That was a waste
of a text.

411
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,037
Let's get down
to brass tacks.

412
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,099
I think that we
might be in trouble.

413
00:19:06,176 --> 00:19:07,609
We don't seem
to have a plan,

414
00:19:07,678 --> 00:19:09,771
so I'm thinking
I go down there,

415
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,214
maybe rattle off a few jokes,
congressman can follow.

416
00:19:13,584 --> 00:19:17,315
He's our best manager? Where's
the off button on this moron?

417
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:20,516
I'm not a moron.

418
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:25,652
Time after time, my
branch leads in sales.

419
00:19:26,297 --> 00:19:30,529
I have personally won over 17
Dundie Awards, so I am not a moron.

420
00:19:30,601 --> 00:19:35,163
And I'm just trying to help,
you know? So, you're the moron.

421
00:19:40,177 --> 00:19:43,613
<i>Yes, it is a thrill
to be honored by one's company.</i>

422
00:19:43,681 --> 00:19:46,741
<i>To have the people that you
work for stop for a minute</i>

423
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:49,786
<i>and say, "Wow, great job!"
That's what it's about.</i>

424
00:19:49,853 --> 00:19:52,788
He can take the bus.
He's had his limo ride.

425
00:19:54,925 --> 00:19:56,552
<i>That is what
it is all about.</i>

426
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,322
<i>Not the perks.
The perks...</i>

427
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,556
<i>The perks, I could
take or leave the perks.</i>

428
00:20:00,631 --> 00:20:02,758
Oscar, Oscar!
Come on!

429
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,631
<i>But limos are for people
who make the company money,</i>

430
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:07,295
<i>not lose millions
and have no plan.</i>

431
00:20:07,371 --> 00:20:08,429
There he is,
there he is!

432
00:20:08,505 --> 00:20:09,972
<i>So we're leaving early.</i>

433
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:13,042
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

434
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,442
Michael!
Oh, yeah!

435
00:20:17,615 --> 00:20:21,051
<i>After all, we are the only
ones with anything to celebrate.</i>

436
00:20:21,118 --> 00:20:24,815
Scranton! Scranton!
Scranton! Scranton!

437
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:29,755
Dunder Mifflin!

438
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:33,124
<i>The gentleman
in the glasses.</i>

439
00:20:34,331 --> 00:20:36,492
<i>Dwight Schrute,
Scranton Branch.</i>

440
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:40,594
<i>I just want to say that I have
been standing in this line all day.</i>

441
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:43,496
<i>And if this line
is any indication</i>

442
00:20:43,574 --> 00:20:45,303
<i>of how this company
is being run,</i>

443
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,344
<i>then we are
in big trouble.</i>

444
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,110
<i>Thank you.
Right, I know.</i>

445
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:59,916
<i>And I just
want to say that</i>

446
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:03,050
<i>I believe that there
are options out there.</i>

447
00:21:03,127 --> 00:21:06,221
<i>A take-a-number option,
like they have in a deli.</i>

448
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,556
<i>What about
line varieties?</i>

449
00:21:09,633 --> 00:21:13,694
<i>Like an express line for quick
comments of 10 words or less.</i>

450
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:16,399
<i>That could move
much more efficiently.</i>

451
00:21:17,975 --> 00:21:21,672
<i>What about ropes along the
lines that you can hold on to?</i>

452
00:21:21,745 --> 00:21:23,076
<i>Thank you.</i>

453
00:21:24,214 --> 00:21:25,647
<i>Thank you for
your suggestions.</i>

454
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:26,876
<i>Yes.</i>
