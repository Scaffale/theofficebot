1
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,271
Dunder Miflin, this is Pam.

2
00:00:07,841 --> 00:00:09,842
Sure, can I ask who's calling?

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,578
Just a second.

4
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,615
Jim Halpert.

5
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,649
What?

6
00:00:17,651 --> 00:00:19,752
How did you get this number?

7
00:00:19,754 --> 00:00:20,819
Stalker.

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:23,088
Katie and Jim met in the office.

9
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,324
And now I guess
they're, like, going out

10
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:27,092
or dating or something.

11
00:00:27,094 --> 00:00:28,694
And, uh...

12
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:31,697
I don't know, you know?

13
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:35,167
They're just... she calls him
and they... you know.

14
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:37,236
I'm sorry, I feel like
I'm talking really loud.

15
00:00:37,238 --> 00:00:38,404
Am I talking really loud?

16
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,705
So we're still on for lunch?

17
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:41,040
You're meeting me here?

18
00:00:41,042 --> 00:00:42,508
Okay.

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,777
Great.
Bye.

20
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,579
Hey.

21
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:49,548
You can just give her
your extension.

22
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,050
Okay.

23
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,386
Howard slash Ryan.

24
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:29,488
Ryan Howard is sitting
in my office.

25
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,024
And he has been a temp here
for a couple of months.

26
00:01:32,026 --> 00:01:34,993
And he's kind of gotten
the lay of the land

27
00:01:34,995 --> 00:01:36,328
a little bit.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,596
A few laughs along the way.

29
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:41,133
And now he wants to know
what I think.

30
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:44,636
The temp agency
wants to know what you think.

31
00:01:44,638 --> 00:01:47,306
Shall we?
Let us proceed.

32
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:50,242
First up, proficiency
in necessary skills.

33
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:54,980
Eeeeeeaaa...

34
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:58,484
Excellent!

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,655
Michael's in there right now
evaluating the temp.

36
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,893
He hasn't evaluated me in years.

37
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,661
Five years from now,
what do you wanna do?

38
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:12,698
Where do you wanna be? Uh, well,
I'm interested in business.

39
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,866
Oh, good.

40
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:15,634
Ambitious.
Excellent.

41
00:02:16,503 --> 00:02:18,270
Wanna be a manager?

42
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,339
Uh, no, actually
what I want is to own

43
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,473
my own company.

44
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,175
That is ridiculous.

45
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:25,878
Ryan's about to attend

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,747
the Michael Scott
school of business.

47
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:32,351
I'm like Mr. Miyagi and Yoda
rolled into one.

48
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:34,586
Much advice you seek.

49
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,589
You know who that is?

50
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:41,226
Fozzy Bear?

51
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:47,199
No, that was Yoda.

52
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:51,570
There are ten rules of business
that you need to learn.

53
00:02:51,572 --> 00:02:52,738
Number one...

54
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,276
You need to play to win...

55
00:02:57,278 --> 00:03:03,782
but you also have to win
to play.

56
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,552
Got it.

57
00:03:06,554 --> 00:03:09,388
And I will give you
the rest of the ten at lunch.

58
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:14,927
Hey, tch tch.

59
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,600
Michael and I have
a very special connection.

60
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,802
He's like Batman,
I'm like Robin.

61
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,538
He's like The Lone Ranger,
and I'm like Tonto.

62
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,273
And it's not like there was
The Lone Ranger

63
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,342
and Tonto and Bonto.

64
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:42,721
People!

65
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:43,722
Okay!
Everybody?

66
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,890
This is not a test!

67
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,191
Go to the exits!

68
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,526
Do not panic!

69
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:49,127
Get up off your desks!

70
00:03:49,129 --> 00:03:50,495
Do not panic!

71
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:53,232
This is not a drill!

72
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:55,968
Arms at your side!
Arms at your side!

73
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,903
This is a paper company, people!

74
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,838
Step lively!

75
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,373
This whole place is a tinderbox.

76
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,841
It is ready to blow.

77
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,812
This is not a test!

78
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:07,813
Can you leave?

79
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:08,780
Oh, you say that every time.

80
00:04:08,782 --> 00:04:10,282
Do you wanna die?!

81
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:12,117
Do you wanna die?!

82
00:04:12,119 --> 00:04:13,552
Out!

83
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:15,754
Stanley, have you ever seen
a burn victim?

84
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,122
Move to the exits!

85
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:18,123
You're safety partners!

86
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:20,158
Real smoke!
We've got smoke!

87
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,527
Smoke!

88
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:26,365
God!

89
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,243
Oh, Kelly!
Are you okay?

90
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:39,244
I gotcha!

91
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,412
Hey!
Get off me!

92
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,847
Get the off of me!

93
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:42,848
Breathe through your nose.

94
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,017
Remove your stockings!
Okay?

95
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:46,318
They'll melt
right into your flesh!

96
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,453
Stay below the smoke line.

97
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,990
Let's go!
Clear out, stat!

98
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,393
Stat means now!

99
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,430
Yes, I was the first one out.

100
00:04:58,432 --> 00:05:01,333
And, yes, I've heard
women and children first.

101
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:03,835
But we do not employ children.

102
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:06,805
We are not a sweatshop,
thankfully.

103
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:12,344
And women are equal
in the workplace by law.

104
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:14,646
So, I let them out first,

105
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,948
I have a lawsuit on my hands.

106
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:19,184
Another rule of business...

107
00:05:19,186 --> 00:05:21,353
is being able to adapt
to different situations.

108
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,988
Yeah?

109
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,758
Adapt, react, readapt...

110
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,593
Apt.
Right?

111
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,594
That's rule number two.

112
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,629
Okay!

113
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,930
Guys, listen up,
we need a headcount.

114
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:33,465
Okay, we need a countoff.
Michael's number one.

115
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:34,499
Where is he?
Where is he?

116
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:36,335
So what was rule two?

117
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,103
Uh, adapt, react, readapt, apt.

118
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,404
Okay, well, let's...

119
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,806
Let's just kind of take it
a little slower.

120
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,408
Hey, Michael, uh, Ryan needs
a number for the countoff.

121
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,711
Okay, uh, well, one is taken.

122
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,712
Uh, okay, two?

123
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,447
No!
Okay... uh, sorry.

124
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:49,481
Okay, he can have 14.

125
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,049
Margery's not here today.

126
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,217
Well, he needs
a permanent number, all right?

127
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,485
No, I don't.

128
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,553
Oh, you know what else?

129
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:56,088
I thought of a nickname
for the three of us.

130
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,556
Three musketeers.

131
00:05:57,558 --> 00:05:59,758
Um, yeah, okay.

132
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,893
That... no no no no!
I got one, I got one.

133
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:03,695
The three stooges.

134
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,263
That's funny, too, but if we're
the three musketeers...

135
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:09,201
I don't wanna be,
like, a guy here, you know?

136
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:11,837
Like, Stanley is the
crossword puzzle guy.

137
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,872
And Angela has cats.

138
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:17,576
I don't wanna
have a thing here, you know?

139
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:21,279
I don't wanna be
the something guy.

140
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,382
Okay, you know what?

141
00:06:23,384 --> 00:06:26,084
I think I'm gonna be
setting the agenda here, okay?

142
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,252
Can everybody gather up, please.

143
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,420
Important announcement.

144
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:29,521
Very important announcement.

145
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,823
I think this is
a perfect opportunity

146
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:34,059
for all of us to participate

147
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,661
in some really intense

148
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:38,296
psychologically revealing
conversations.

149
00:06:38,298 --> 00:06:40,799
So we're gonna be playing
Desert Island...

150
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:43,235
um, "Who Would You Do?"

151
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:44,736
And, um...

152
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,704
"Would You Rather?"

153
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:47,105
"Would You Rather?"

154
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:48,373
"Would You Rather?"
is our third game.

155
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,982
Yeah!

156
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,784
Hey, what's going on, man?
How are ya?

157
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,218
Long time no see.
Yeah, I know, right?

158
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:03,889
Hey, guys, great response time.

159
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:06,291
Listen up.
I got some theories.

160
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:07,459
There's a...

161
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,729
Okay, so, three books
on a desert island.

162
00:07:10,731 --> 00:07:11,763
Angela.

163
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:12,831
The Bible.

164
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:19,471
That's one book.
You've got two others.

165
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,439
Purpose Driven Life.

166
00:07:20,441 --> 00:07:22,073
Nice.

167
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,575
Third book.

168
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,676
No.

169
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,446
Okay!
Phyllis.

170
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,713
Um, The Da Vinci Code.

171
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,315
The Da Vinci Code.

172
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,616
I would take The Da Vinci Code.

173
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,485
So I could burn
The Da Vinci code.

174
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,853
Okay, great, that's gonna
keep you warm

175
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,822
for, like, seven seconds.

176
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:38,890
Question, is there firewood
on the island?

177
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,325
I guess.

178
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,060
Then I would bring an axe.
No books.

179
00:07:42,062 --> 00:07:44,796
No, it has to be a book, Dwight.

180
00:07:44,798 --> 00:07:47,399
Fine.
Physician's Desk Reference.

181
00:07:47,401 --> 00:07:48,500
Nice.
Smart.

182
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:49,601
Hollowed out.

183
00:07:49,603 --> 00:07:51,503
Inside, waterproof matches,

184
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:54,306
iodine tablets.

185
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,208
Beet seeds, protein bars,
NASA blanket.

186
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:58,910
And...

187
00:07:58,912 --> 00:08:00,312
in case I get bored,

188
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,314
Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone.

189
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:04,716
No, Harry Potter
and the prisoner of Azkaban.

190
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:07,486
Question, did my shoes
come off in the plane crash?

191
00:08:07,488 --> 00:08:11,223
Rule number four in business.

192
00:08:11,225 --> 00:08:13,959
Image is everything.
Andre Agassi.

193
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,361
This car is
an investment, right?

194
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:18,663
If I have to take out a client.

195
00:08:18,665 --> 00:08:21,199
Or I'm seen
around Scranton in it.

196
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:25,871
I love it.
I love this car.

197
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:29,508
Do you like it?

198
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:33,044
Yeah.

199
00:08:33,045 --> 00:08:35,480
Okay, I thought people
read more books.

200
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,349
DVDs. Five movies.

201
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,383
What would you bring
to the island.

202
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,584
Yes, Meredith.

203
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,454
Legends of the Fall,
My Big Fat Greek Wedding,

204
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,956
Legally Blonde,
Bridges of Madison County.

205
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,591
Wow.

206
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,527
Legends of the Fall.
Wow.

207
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,595
Bridges of Madison County,
Legally Blonde.

208
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:51,663
These movies are just...

209
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,731
Well, I kind of like...

210
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,900
Wait, wait, wait.
Pam, no.

211
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:57,068
Do you understand?

212
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:59,471
The game is
desert island movies,

213
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:00,772
not guilty pleasure movies.

214
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:02,607
Desert island movies are
the movies you're gonna watch

215
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:06,545
for the rest of your life!
Forever!

216
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:07,612
Unforgivable.
I take it back.

217
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:08,680
Unforgivable.

218
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:10,282
I take it back!
Good.

219
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:11,750
And Ghost.

220
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,952
But, uh, just that one scene.

221
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:18,223
Is this your car, Ryan?

222
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,458
Wow, some pretty big books
back there.

223
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,493
Good shocks.

224
00:09:21,495 --> 00:09:24,462
Hello, Mr. Egghead.
Beep!

225
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:26,264
Oh, Stanley Kaplan, I know him.

226
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:28,767
M is for murder.
P is for...

227
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,468
That's actually a test prep book.
What?

228
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:33,071
That's a test prep
for business school.

229
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,139
Oh, thinking about
business school.

230
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,340
I just got in.

231
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:36,341
I applied.
I go at night.

232
00:09:36,343 --> 00:09:37,509
Really?

233
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,977
So you think you know
a lot about business?

234
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,745
No, not yet.
Just started.

235
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,147
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

236
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,682
Quiz me.

237
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45,650
I wouldn't even know...
Oh, come on.

238
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:48,186
Come on, Egghead.
Let's do it.

239
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,454
Quiz me up.

240
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,689
All right.

241
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:52,924
Um, why have people been
rethinking

242
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:56,127
the Microsoft model
in the past few years?

243
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,833
When I was Ryan's age,

244
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,169
I worked
in a fast food restaurant

245
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:06,304
to save up money for school.

246
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:10,008
And then I lost it
in a pyramid scheme.

247
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:12,444
But I learned more
about business

248
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,512
right then and there

249
00:10:14,514 --> 00:10:15,847
than business school
would ever teach me.

250
00:10:15,849 --> 00:10:17,582
Or Ryan would ever teach me.

251
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:20,619
Is it cheaper to sign
a new customer

252
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:22,520
or to keep an existing customer?

253
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,588
Keep an existing...

254
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:24,990
Shut... it.

255
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:27,158
Can I just do it please?

256
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,027
Uh, it's equal.

257
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,396
It is ten times more expensive
to sign a new customer.

258
00:10:31,398 --> 00:10:33,465
Okay, yes.
It was a trick question.

259
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,699
Yeah, but look.

260
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:36,001
I mean, he didn't need
business school, okay?

261
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,535
Michael comes from
the school of hard knocks.

262
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,570
Okay, Dwight?
Self-taught.

263
00:10:38,572 --> 00:10:39,571
You didn't even go to college.

264
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:40,705
You know what?

265
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,073
You don't need
to help me here, okay?

266
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,808
You know, maybe you should
go to business school

267
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,276
like Ryan.

268
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,912
Then you'd know what
you're talking about.

269
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,648
You're studying
with the master, huh?

270
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,383
You should learn
from him, right?

271
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,684
Right?

272
00:10:52,686 --> 00:10:54,285
Stop.
You know what, Dwight?

273
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,587
You're acting like a dork.

274
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:56,955
Would you cool it, please?

275
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,024
Okay.

276
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,393
Hey, he's not your
five year old brother, Dwight.

277
00:11:01,395 --> 00:11:04,095
He's a valued member
of this company.

278
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:05,296
And you know what?

279
00:11:05,298 --> 00:11:08,233
He knows more about business
than you ever will.

280
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:12,470
Stupid.

281
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:13,838
I did not go to business school.

282
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
You know who else
didn't go to business school?

283
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,043
LeBron James, Tracy McGrady.

284
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,444
Kobe Bryant.

285
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,279
They went right from
high school to the NBA.

286
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,080
So...

287
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,953
So it's not
the same thing at all.

288
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,722
Look at this stuff.

289
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,991
Market fragments,
what is that supposed to be?

290
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:34,759
It's a way of looking
at consumers as subsets

291
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,461
of a larger client base.

292
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,497
You are so smart.

293
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:41,900
You are so f-ing smart.

294
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:43,501
You should be teaching me.

295
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,038
Pam, get us back into it.

296
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,673
Five movies, go ahead.

297
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,875
Okay, um, Fargo.

298
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,645
Um, Edward Scissorhands,
Dazed and Confused.

299
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,679
Ooh, definitely in my top five.

300
00:11:54,681 --> 00:11:56,681
Yes, in my top three,
so suck it.

301
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,983
Breakfast Club.

302
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,419
Um, The Princess Bride.

303
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,454
Okay, that's five.

304
00:12:02,456 --> 00:12:04,022
No!
My all time favorite!

305
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:05,390
Pam, play by the rules.
Play by the rules.

306
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:07,158
All time favorite.

307
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,393
Dwight!

308
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,162
All time favorite movie.

309
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,101
The Crow.

310
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,407
I became a salesman
because of people.

311
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:24,275
I love making friends.

312
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,145
But then I was promoted
to manager

313
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:30,482
at a very young age.

314
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:32,183
And I still try
to be a friend first.

315
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:35,920
But, you know...

316
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,455
When you're very successful,

317
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:40,291
your co-workers
look at you differently.

318
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,800
Ah, what do you think?

319
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:51,069
Maybe we should get some air.

320
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,837
No, I'm okay.

321
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,307
I'm really uncomfortable.

322
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,145
All right, let's move on.

323
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:01,846
Let's move on to the main event.

324
00:13:01,848 --> 00:13:03,114
Who would you do?

325
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,016
Present company excluded?

326
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:05,984
Um, not necessarily.

327
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,685
Pam.
Pam.

328
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,853
Um...

329
00:13:10,422 --> 00:13:11,790
Okay, you know what?

330
00:13:11,792 --> 00:13:13,358
Maybe I'll finish
explaining the rules.

331
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,660
Let me explain it first
and then...

332
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,633
Yeah, so we'll get right...
you know what?

333
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:23,568
I'll be right back.
Stanley.

334
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,702
You're taking over
for me, buddy.

335
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,670
I'll be right back.

336
00:13:25,672 --> 00:13:26,738
Okay.
Um...

337
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:32,710
Dwight.
Dwight.

338
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,948
Come on, Dwight, use words.

339
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,552
Why didn't I go
to business school?

340
00:13:40,554 --> 00:13:41,686
Who goes to business school?

341
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:42,987
The temp.
He does?

342
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:44,789
Yeah, it's all him
and Michael talk about anymore.

343
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:48,660
You know,
I bet Ryan thinks to himself,

344
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,196
"I wish I were a volunteer
Sheriff on the weekend."

345
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:52,964
He doesn't even know
that I do that.

346
00:13:52,966 --> 00:13:54,799
You should tell him.

347
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,168
Oh, yeah, Pam.
Right.

348
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,604
That's gonna help things,
just talk it out.

349
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:02,073
I hope the war goes on forever
and Ryan gets drafted.

350
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,107
Dwight.
What?

351
00:14:03,109 --> 00:14:04,342
I'm sorry I said that.

352
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:05,910
I didn't...

353
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,112
Just part of me meant it.

354
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:12,150
Besides, he'd end up being
a hero, anyway.

355
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,818
You know what you should do.

356
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,520
You should quit.

357
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,691
And then, that would
stick it to both of them.

358
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:23,761
No, Jim, I'm not gonna quit.

359
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:26,297
Then Ryan wins.
Yeah, you're right.

360
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:28,066
Thanks, you guys.

361
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,902
I just need some alone time.

362
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,770
Okay.

363
00:14:40,246 --> 00:14:41,379
Hey, guys, what's going on?

364
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:42,347
Nothin'.
Hey!

365
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,915
What's up?

366
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,149
Can I hang with you guys
for a bit?

367
00:14:45,151 --> 00:14:46,618
The warehouse guys are...

368
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,785
a bunch of jackasses sometimes.

369
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:49,787
Come on, people,
you know the rules of the game.

370
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:51,289
Oh, hey, hey, game?

371
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,024
What game are we playing here?

372
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:55,126
Okay, it's called
"Who Would You Do?"

373
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,828
Oh!

374
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,963
I play this at home all the time

375
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,798
while I'm falling asleep.

376
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,102
What, uh... where are we?
Where are we here?

377
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,236
Roy?
Roy?

378
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:07,305
Who would you do, Roy?

379
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:09,707
Uh...
Oh, I got it!

380
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:13,544
What's the name of that
tight-ass Christian chick?

381
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:14,545
The blond?

382
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,914
My name is Angela.

383
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:18,683
Hey, Angela, Roy.
Nice to meet you.

384
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,485
All right, who's next?
Who's next?

385
00:15:20,487 --> 00:15:22,253
Who's next?
Who's... Jim?

386
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:24,622
You're next.
Who would you do?

387
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:29,260
Um, Kevin, hands down.

388
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,628
Yeah.

389
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:32,697
He's really got that
teddy bear thing going on.

390
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:34,933
Afterwards we could
just watch bowling.

391
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,972
Well, I would definitely
have sex with Ryan.

392
00:15:42,908 --> 00:15:45,209
'Cause he is gonna
own his own business.

393
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:47,545
You're all gay.

394
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:49,814
Who's, uh, who's next?
Who we got?

395
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,650
Who?
Hey.

396
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,252
No, I can talk, I can talk.
I can talk.

397
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:55,787
Well, wish I had my cell phone,

398
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,155
but I left it inside, so...

399
00:15:57,157 --> 00:15:58,589
Would that make you happy?

400
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,757
What's that?
If you had your cell phone?

401
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:00,825
Would it make you happy?
Yeah.

402
00:16:00,827 --> 00:16:01,993
I'm on it.

403
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,061
Dwight.
Hey!

404
00:16:03,063 --> 00:16:04,128
You can't go back in yet!

405
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,129
Dwight!

406
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,331
He is an idiot.

407
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,166
The man is an idiot,
ladies and gentlemen.

408
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:10,835
What if he dies in the fire?

409
00:16:10,837 --> 00:16:13,471
And that's the last thing
you ever said to him?

410
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:16,507
I didn't say it to him,
I said it about him.

411
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,013
Jim.
Definitely Jim.

412
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,948
Definitely, definitely Jim.

413
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,016
Come on, Pam.
Pam?

414
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:25,984
Come on.

415
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,618
Um...

416
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,920
Oscar's kind of cute.

417
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:30,888
Yeah, I like Oscar.

418
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,024
Ooh, Toby.

419
00:16:33,026 --> 00:16:36,828
How long does it take
to find a cell phone?

420
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,966
Um, is there anybody else?

421
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,638
Hey, where are you?
Oh, good.

422
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,073
Yeah, we're just here.

423
00:16:49,075 --> 00:16:50,541
We're playing desert island.

424
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,777
That's where you pick
your five favorite DVDs.

425
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,114
Seriously,
where the hell is Dwight?

426
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,350
I don't know.

427
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:02,954
Hey, call my cell phone.

428
00:17:02,956 --> 00:17:04,756
It'll make it easier
for him to find.

429
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,092
What's your number?

430
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,494
I gave it to you in the car.

431
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,462
Um...

432
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,198
I saw you program it in.

433
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,300
You gotta... you gotta
give it to me again.

434
00:17:16,302 --> 00:17:17,935
All right.

435
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,807
Now, I have it.

436
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,722
Um, I better tell somebody.

437
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,023
Excuse me, sir?

438
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,325
Dwight!

439
00:17:41,327 --> 00:17:42,860
Dwight!

440
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,896
God, man,
why did you go in there?

441
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:47,732
Everybody was scared
out of their wits, man.

442
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,634
Everyone, okay.
Uh...

443
00:17:49,636 --> 00:17:51,569
I have an announcement.

444
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:54,305
Apparently, in business school,

445
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,074
they don't teach you
how to operate

446
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,975
a toaster oven.

447
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:00,411
Because some smart, sexy temp

448
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,914
left his cheese pita on oven

449
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,783
instead of timing it
for the toaster thing!

450
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:10,621
Oh, wow!
Okay.

451
00:18:10,623 --> 00:18:13,391
Well, I guess they don't teach
how to operate

452
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,959
a toaster oven
in business school...

453
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,494
That's exactly what I said!

454
00:18:16,496 --> 00:18:18,196
Hey, did you miss that day,
there, Ryan?

455
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,263
Were you absent?

456
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,932
Toaster oven 101?

457
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,200
I am so sorry.

458
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:25,303
Oh, man.

459
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,605
Hey, I know
what'll impress everybody.

460
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,007
I'll start a fire.

461
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,042
Oh, man.

462
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,711
Bad idea.
Bad idea jeans.

463
00:18:33,713 --> 00:18:35,813
I have a song...
attention everyone...

464
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,315
that I wanna sing.

465
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,016
That I wrote especially
for this occasion

466
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,518
when I was up there
among the flames.

467
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,153
Ready?

468
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:59,504
I can't believe
I started the fire.

469
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:08,212
I'm so sorry.

470
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,083
Eat it!
He has to eat it!

471
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:13,151
Hey.
How are you?

472
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:14,752
Good, how are you?
I'm good.

473
00:19:14,754 --> 00:19:16,187
It's good to see you.
Good to see you too.

474
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,588
I'm hungry.
Yeah, I am too.

475
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,491
Oh, I have been thinking
the whole way over,

476
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,693
and I have my answers.
What answers?

477
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:24,128
Uh, for the desert island.

478
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,463
Oh, right!
Right right right!

479
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,697
Come on, come on.

480
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:27,732
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather 'round.

481
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:29,133
We have one more participant.

482
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,968
Come on, be polite.
Be polite.

483
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:34,138
Desert island, five movies, go.

484
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:38,576
Okay, um, first, Legally Blonde.

485
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,249
I forgot what
a super nice girl Katie is.

486
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,884
And, just... good for Jim.

487
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,953
They are so cute together.

488
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:52,790
And, um, what an adorable car!

489
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:55,226
Okay!

490
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,327
I think the game's over.

491
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,328
People are, like, leaving.

492
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,796
There was
a bigger crowd last time.

493
00:19:58,798 --> 00:19:59,864
Do you wanna just go to lunch?

494
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,065
Okay, all right.
Yeah?

495
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,066
You wanna drive?
Sure.

496
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:03,668
All right.

497
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:13,444
They are so cute.

498
00:20:13,446 --> 00:20:14,845
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

499
00:20:14,847 --> 00:20:16,514
Answer me this, though.
What?

500
00:20:16,516 --> 00:20:19,183
Was it worth it?
Was it worth it, temp?

501
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,418
No.
Really?

502
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,586
I'm really sorry, Dwight.

503
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:24,055
The fire guy!
The fire guy!

504
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:34,232
Okay, rule five, safety first,

505
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:37,668
i.e. don't burn the
building down, okay?

506
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:38,769
That should be
a no-brainer.

507
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:40,905
Oh, look...

508
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:44,308
Ryan is book smart.

509
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,911
And I am street smart.

510
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,045
And book smart.

511
00:20:48,047 --> 00:20:52,350
I'll give you
the rest of the ten tomorrow.
