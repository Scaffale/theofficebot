1
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:04,227
Yeah?
You wanted to see me?

2
00:00:04,302 --> 00:00:07,794
Yes, Oscar, come on in.
Close the door if you would.

3
00:00:08,473 --> 00:00:10,304
Thank you. Thanks so
much for talking to me.

4
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,399
Yeah, sure.

5
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:13,842
I'm going in
for a procedure today.

6
00:00:13,912 --> 00:00:15,846
Is everything okay?
Yeah.

7
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,109
It's routine. I'm just
a little bit scared.

8
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,879
I'm sure everything
will be fine.

9
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:23,443
What's the procedure,
if you don't mind my asking?

10
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:25,114
It is a colonoscopy.

11
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,716
Okay.

12
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,786
In your experience,
what should I be expecting

13
00:00:30,862 --> 00:00:35,128
in terms of sensation
or emotions?

14
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:47,475
Is there anything I can do to
make it more pleasurable for me,

15
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:49,309
or for Dr. Chaudry?

16
00:00:51,316 --> 00:00:52,408
Oh, my God!

17
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:54,679
My main concern, should
I have a safe word?

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,014
Yeah.

19
00:01:17,943 --> 00:01:19,137
So, Michael, you think
you can give me a rundown

20
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:20,838
on the Buffalo
clients by Monday?

21
00:01:20,912 --> 00:01:22,880
Absolutely. You know what?
I'll do you one better.

22
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:24,472
Sunday. Sunday night.

23
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,039
Okay. I will
get it Monday.

24
00:01:26,117 --> 00:01:27,812
Hold on, big guy.

25
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,377
I'm going to put it in the mail
Sunday night, you'll get it Wednesday.

26
00:01:30,455 --> 00:01:32,355
Okay. Jim, you want to
hit the conference room?

27
00:01:32,424 --> 00:01:33,413
Sure.

28
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:34,516
Hey, good luck.

29
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:36,921
Oh, right, this thing.
I remember now.

30
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,087
What's this about?

31
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:39,790
This is just me and
David, if that's okay.

32
00:01:39,865 --> 00:01:41,389
It's okay with me. He's
going to want me in there.

33
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,866
No. It's okay,
Michael. We got it.

34
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,434
Really?
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,504 --> 00:01:47,699
All right. Do you mind
if I sit this out?

36
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:51,606
I have so much work to do, I feel
like I'm going to blow my brains out.

37
00:01:52,811 --> 00:01:54,438
Okay. You got it.

38
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:04,220
Am I worried that Jim and David
are having a meeting without me?

39
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:07,986
<i>No. Because we are
the three amigos.</i>

40
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,920
And once in a while,

41
00:02:09,995 --> 00:02:13,431
<i>one of the amigos will
go off to the bathroom,</i>

42
00:02:13,498 --> 00:02:16,331
while the other two
have a secret meeting.

43
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:24,365
Hey, let me escort you to your desk.

44
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:27,900
Okay. It's just three or
four steps, but thank you.

45
00:02:27,979 --> 00:02:30,140
Thank you. You and Jim are close, huh?

46
00:02:30,215 --> 00:02:33,412
Yeah. I think the pregnancy
really brought us together.

47
00:02:33,485 --> 00:02:36,420
Hey, what do you think he
and David are talking about?

48
00:02:36,488 --> 00:02:37,614
What do you...

49
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,020
Um, I don't know.

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,354
Well, you said good
luck to Jim as he walked in.

51
00:02:41,426 --> 00:02:45,055
Did I? Doesn't sound like
me. Not very superstitious.

52
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:52,936
If you're lying to me right now, Pam,

53
00:02:53,004 --> 00:02:55,029
your baby is gonna
come out a liar.

54
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,368
That's how it works. They inherit
things through the breast milk.

55
00:03:01,046 --> 00:03:03,310
Please don't talk
about my breast milk.

56
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:05,747
I just don't want
you to lie to me.

57
00:03:06,084 --> 00:03:09,019
I don't want you to ever lie
to me. Have I ever lied to you?

58
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:10,076
Yeah.

59
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,747
I just don't
want you to.

60
00:03:11,823 --> 00:03:13,586
I was rushing
to fill an order.

61
00:03:13,658 --> 00:03:17,059
I put the ladder up to grab a box
of three hole from the top shelf,

62
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:19,722
next thing I know, I'm on the
ground, ladder's on top of me.

63
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,059
And that's how you
broke your ankle?

64
00:03:21,132 --> 00:03:22,292
Yes.

65
00:03:22,367 --> 00:03:24,335
Hmm. Interesting.

66
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:28,463
How did the ladder end up on
top of you if you fell off of it?

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,838
This doesn't concern you, man.
You need to walk away.

68
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:33,173
Oh, really? I'm sorry. I
thought this was a free country.

69
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:35,337
I didn't know we were
in Communist Sweden.

70
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,471
If we were
living in Sweden,

71
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:37,537
I wouldn't have
to worry about this

72
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:39,550
because we'd have
universal healthcare.

73
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,309
That's not... Okay.

74
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:42,683
Be quiet.
I'm talking about...

75
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:44,016
Hmm...

76
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:45,556
I will send this
off to corporate.

77
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,421
Make sure you hold on
to your medical bills.

78
00:03:47,492 --> 00:03:48,686
Feel better.

79
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,024
Thanks, T-man. Later.

80
00:03:52,998 --> 00:03:55,626
So long, Darryl.
Feel better.

81
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,258
He's lying.

82
00:03:57,335 --> 00:03:58,597
He has a doctor's note.

83
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:02,798
From who? Dr. J? You really
need to investigate this.

84
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:04,808
People don't just
fall off of ladders.

85
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,241
Guy on my street
fell off a ladder

86
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:07,903
painting his house.
It was on the news.

87
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,777
Since when have you known
Darryl to rush to do anything

88
00:04:10,849 --> 00:04:13,283
other than to come up here
for birthday cake?

89
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,581
"Y'all having birthday cake?"

90
00:04:15,654 --> 00:04:16,985
That's not a very good Darryl. Please!

91
00:04:17,055 --> 00:04:20,923
And how many foremen do
you know that pull boxes?

92
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,987
It just doesn't add up.

93
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:29,691
<i>Well, we did a little
investigation, and Dwight had a good point.</i>

94
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:33,534
<i>The ladder didn't reach the top
shelf. I don't know if I believe it,</i>

95
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,574
<i>but I am a fan of the
hardboiled detective novel.</i>

96
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:38,973
"I'll punch you
into mush, see?"

97
00:04:39,944 --> 00:04:43,880
Uh-huh. Well, if he doesn't like it, you
can tell that s.o. B that he is fired.

98
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:48,248
Sorry, I'm going into a meeting right
now. I will. I love you, too. Bye.

99
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,308
Who was that?

100
00:04:49,387 --> 00:04:51,150
Sorry about that.
What'd I miss?

101
00:04:51,222 --> 00:04:53,656
Michael, we would like to continue
the rest of this meeting in private,

102
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:54,714
please,
if you don't mind.

103
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,090
I do not mind.

104
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:59,028
Yes, I do. No, I don't.
Yes, I do. No, I don't mind.

105
00:04:59,097 --> 00:05:01,463
Catch you guys on the
flippity-flop. Oh, this...

106
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,296
Call waiting. Yeah?

107
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,461
Uh-huh. Well, you tell the
mayor he just lost six votes.

108
00:05:07,605 --> 00:05:09,539
They've been
in there a while.

109
00:05:09,607 --> 00:05:11,404
Yeah.
Can't be good.

110
00:05:12,043 --> 00:05:13,135
No.

111
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:14,576
Think they're
talking about me?

112
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:17,681
No, I think they're
talking about me.

113
00:05:17,749 --> 00:05:21,048
Yeah. That makes way more
sense. Okay. Thanks, boss.

114
00:05:21,886 --> 00:05:23,854
<i>What is Jim telling
him? That I can't handle this job?</i>

115
00:05:23,922 --> 00:05:26,049
<i>That's bull crap.
That is bull crap.</i>

116
00:05:27,058 --> 00:05:29,891
<i>Although it has been
chaotic lately.</i>

117
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:32,020
Corporate shut down
the Buffalo branch,

118
00:05:32,097 --> 00:05:35,362
which left us to absorb
all of their clients.

119
00:05:35,433 --> 00:05:39,392
<i>I will tell you, there
has been work every day.</i>

120
00:05:39,471 --> 00:05:41,564
Had to come in
on a Saturday

121
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:45,739
to retrieve... I left
my cell phone here.

122
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:48,870
Hey, Kelly.

123
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:51,279
So jealous
of your boobs.

124
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,344
Thank you.

125
00:05:53,418 --> 00:05:55,784
Um, listen, I just wanted to confirm

126
00:05:55,854 --> 00:05:57,947
that you're not
coming to the wedding,

127
00:05:58,022 --> 00:06:01,458
which is totally understandable,
and more than fine.

128
00:06:01,526 --> 00:06:02,686
Is Ryan going?

129
00:06:02,761 --> 00:06:04,695
I don't know,
he hasn't RSVPed yet.

130
00:06:04,763 --> 00:06:07,197
We invited everyone in
the office to our wedding,

131
00:06:07,265 --> 00:06:08,823
even though we realized most people

132
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,165
wouldn't be able to make
the drive to Niagara Falls.

133
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,700
Which is why we're
having it in Niagara Falls.

134
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:18,309
Then Michael
told everyone

135
00:06:18,376 --> 00:06:21,834
they could have Friday and
Monday off if they came.

136
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:25,781
So now, people have to decide if
they want to come to our wedding

137
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,841
or have to work.

138
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,012
Here's the deal.
I really want to go.

139
00:06:30,088 --> 00:06:31,885
But I'm not gonna go
if Ryan doesn't go,

140
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:34,049
because it's kind of
a waste of time.

141
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,251
That came out wrong.

142
00:06:35,326 --> 00:06:36,987
It would be awesome if you
could try to get him to go

143
00:06:37,061 --> 00:06:40,326
because I'd really like
to be there to support Jim.

144
00:06:44,669 --> 00:06:46,830
What can I do
for you, hoss?

145
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:48,600
How are your
sales doing?

146
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:50,573
How are my sales doing?

147
00:06:51,176 --> 00:06:52,404
Busted.

148
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:56,002
You know, my numbers
are down a little bit.

149
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,241
And it's 'cause
of the economy.

150
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:02,183
You're not buying it.
You're good.

151
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:04,244
Okay, the truth is

152
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:07,223
I have been having trouble
focusing lately. I'm in this weird,

153
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:12,127
flirty, nebulous thing
with this cousin of mine.

154
00:07:12,931 --> 00:07:14,694
And it's a total mind f'er.

155
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:16,461
Again with the cousin.

156
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,195
Oh, I'm sorry, Phyllis.

157
00:07:18,269 --> 00:07:20,100
You explain
this email. Okay?

158
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:24,574
"Hey, Andy, let's go visit Grandma
and then get drunk together. Ha, ha."

159
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:28,100
Shh. I'm just trying to figure out
what's going on in that room, okay?

160
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,010
<i>Wallace
had to show up</i>

161
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:33,915
on the one four-month period
that I'm completely overwhelmed.

162
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,021
You know when they say, "It's
so crazy it just might work?"

163
00:07:39,624 --> 00:07:43,287
Well, I don't believe that. I
say go for the airtight plan.

164
00:07:43,361 --> 00:07:45,192
And that is why
I am having Andy

165
00:07:45,263 --> 00:07:46,787
wheel me into
the conference room

166
00:07:46,865 --> 00:07:48,799
inside a makeshift
cheese cart.

167
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:53,267
It is just elegant.

168
00:07:56,641 --> 00:07:58,006
Be my eyes.
You got it.

169
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,941
What have we here?
Oh!

170
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,035
Hello.

171
00:08:01,112 --> 00:08:02,374
Just backing up
and turning around.

172
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,436
Hey, we're
gonna do this...

173
00:08:03,514 --> 00:08:05,573
It's not for you.

174
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,712
I took the liberty of preparing
for you a cheese platter,

175
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,886
which I will place here on the
eastern wall of the conference room.

176
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:18,019
Cheese platter?

177
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,629
From the Wisconsin region,
a nice, firm cheddar.

178
00:08:23,468 --> 00:08:27,268
Also from the great state of
Wisconsin, an aged Parmesan.

179
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,535
Here you will find
a cheddar-style spread,

180
00:08:30,608 --> 00:08:34,704
which has reacted nicely with
the air to form a light rind,

181
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:37,407
which I think you'll find both
challenging and delicious.

182
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:39,416
At that point, I would
recommend you take

183
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:42,510
a quick trip south of the border
to the great state of Illinois,

184
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:45,579
where you will find this
fine blue cheese dressing.

185
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:47,318
If I may be so bold,

186
00:08:47,392 --> 00:08:50,190
it's a lot of fun
to let the goldfish

187
00:08:50,261 --> 00:08:53,025
take a little swim
in the blue cheese.

188
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,398
All right, well, I should
go. Thanks for this.

189
00:09:00,004 --> 00:09:01,198
You've given me
a lot to think about.

190
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,297
Please promise me you won't
do anything until we speak.

191
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:04,841
No, I won't.

192
00:09:05,977 --> 00:09:07,444
All right. Hey,
thanks for taking the time.

193
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:10,106
Yeah. Appreciate it.
Thank you, Jim.

194
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,578
Erin,
is Michael around?

195
00:09:17,655 --> 00:09:19,748
I think
he's around here.

196
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,387
Is that...

197
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,620
Hey, hey, hey.

198
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,629
You must have walked right
past me. How you doing?

199
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:27,130
Yeah. Could we talk in
your office for a sec?

200
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:29,132
Yes, definitely.

201
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,394
Okay.

202
00:09:38,276 --> 00:09:42,679
It sounds
like a EMD P40.

203
00:09:42,747 --> 00:09:45,181
Nah. That's a GE.

204
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,341
The P40 is much
higher-pitched.

205
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:48,851
You're into trains?

206
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,512
Have been my whole life. Wow!

207
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:53,148
I'm rebuilding a
turn-of-the-century steam engine

208
00:09:53,224 --> 00:09:54,748
in my slaughterhouse.

209
00:09:54,826 --> 00:09:56,760
That's so cool.
Yeah.

210
00:09:56,828 --> 00:09:58,455
Wow! I'd love to take a look at that.

211
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,121
Yeah. It's just a
run-of-the-mill slaughterhouse,

212
00:10:00,198 --> 00:10:01,187
but sure, anytime.

213
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,597
Well, you know,
because of the trains.

214
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:05,533
Wait, someone's coming.
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

215
00:10:05,603 --> 00:10:08,003
It's Darryl! Get down!
He's not using crutches!

216
00:10:08,072 --> 00:10:09,664
Get the camera.
Start taping.

217
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:10,765
Drive!

218
00:10:10,842 --> 00:10:12,707
Worker's comp, my ass!

219
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:14,404
I can't believe this.

220
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,639
Hey, you ass!

221
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:16,737
Toby!

222
00:10:16,814 --> 00:10:19,544
You gonna eat all
that dog food yourself?

223
00:10:20,651 --> 00:10:22,778
No, no!

224
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:25,285
Oh, man!
You okay?

225
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,380
Just drive.

226
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,023
Hey, Ryan.
Hey.

227
00:10:33,097 --> 00:10:36,032
So, I just wanted to confirm that
you're not coming to my wedding.

228
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,159
Yeah, I might stop by.

229
00:10:38,236 --> 00:10:40,261
It costs about
$75 per person.

230
00:10:40,338 --> 00:10:43,865
Okay. I once had a glass of
Cognac that cost $77, so...

231
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,933
Can you just tell me now
if you're coming or not?

232
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:50,209
Yes. I'm coming
to your wedding.

233
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,215
Okay. Ryan Howard, yes.

234
00:10:52,283 --> 00:10:53,841
Probably yes.

235
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,613
Kelly Kapoor, yes.

236
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,112
Are you sure you're okay with
these new responsibilities?

237
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:00,418
Look who you're talking to.

238
00:11:00,491 --> 00:11:04,188
Just trying to figure out the best
way to utilize everyone's talents.

239
00:11:04,262 --> 00:11:06,389
Well, I would say
that my greatest talent

240
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:09,831
is being the best
man, woman or child

241
00:11:09,901 --> 00:11:11,528
to have ever run
this branch. Ever.

242
00:11:11,602 --> 00:11:12,626
And what about Jim?

243
00:11:12,703 --> 00:11:14,193
You think Jim is
someone who is ready

244
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:17,002
to move into
a management position?

245
00:11:22,013 --> 00:11:23,742
Permission to speak
on the record.

246
00:11:23,815 --> 00:11:25,112
Please do.

247
00:11:25,183 --> 00:11:28,175
Jim is like Big Bird.

248
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:32,621
He is tall and yellow
and very nice.

249
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,090
But would I put him
in charge? No.

250
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:40,063
I don't think so. He... Big Bird
doesn't make the tough decisions.

251
00:11:40,932 --> 00:11:44,993
If I was going to put someone in
charge, I would put Bert in charge.

252
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:46,969
Or I would put one of the
real grownups in charge,

253
00:11:47,038 --> 00:11:48,062
like Maria.

254
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:49,470
Or Gordon, maybe.

255
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,700
I thought you liked Jim.

256
00:11:50,775 --> 00:11:53,039
Very much.
Jim is my best friend.

257
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,875
But here's his
performance report.

258
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,314
Right here.

259
00:11:59,383 --> 00:12:02,181
Now, this was
written by Toby,

260
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:05,620
who we all know is
extremely reliable.

261
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,953
"Constant office distraction. Spends
way too much time at reception.

262
00:12:10,027 --> 00:12:13,292
"Antagonizes other salesmen.
Not at all what he thinks he is."

263
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:16,492
It's not very well written.
But you get the gist.

264
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:19,934
Is there anybody else you think could
run the day-to-day of the branch?

265
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:22,165
I could just continue
to run it myself, that's...

266
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,040
Jim had an interesting idea to
help you with this extra workload.

267
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:28,101
And it involved
you being promoted

268
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:30,579
to oversee all
northeast sales.

269
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:33,742
And then Jim would be
promoted to your position.

270
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,514
This was Jim's idea?

271
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:38,577
Mmm-hmm.

272
00:12:39,757 --> 00:12:41,019
Wow!

273
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:49,533
Well, I'd have to talk to my
mother and my guy at H&R Block.

274
00:12:52,503 --> 00:12:54,300
Okay. But, well, see,
here's the thing, though.

275
00:12:54,372 --> 00:12:55,930
The plan doesn't work

276
00:12:56,007 --> 00:12:58,669
unless we have someone to
replace you. I was hoping...

277
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:03,041
Plus, we have to worry about
Jim. He has another job offer.

278
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,344
We may have to replace him.

279
00:13:05,416 --> 00:13:09,182
I didn't tell Michael because
I thought he'd try to help.

280
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:14,352
Example, he handed out Jell-O shots at
the 23rd mile of the Steamtown Marathon.

281
00:13:17,461 --> 00:13:19,691
Jim, can you walk me down
to my car for a second?

282
00:13:19,764 --> 00:13:20,924
Sure.

283
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,944
I can't help but feel
partially responsible.

284
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:59,164
Little pick-me-up. Those
are the best. Sugar rush.

285
00:13:59,237 --> 00:14:01,705
When you were in the office
earlier talking to Wallace,

286
00:14:01,772 --> 00:14:03,899
did I come up at all?

287
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,076
Well, we did talk about
how handsome you are.

288
00:14:08,145 --> 00:14:09,476
Why don't we head into
your office and talk?

289
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:13,176
Okay. What did
we... God! We said...

290
00:14:13,951 --> 00:14:16,886
I know there were
certain things we said.

291
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,050
Michael, look.
I'll just be honest with you.

292
00:14:19,123 --> 00:14:21,990
Earlier today, I spoke with
Wallace about a promotion.

293
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:23,617
And I actually think
that talk went really well.

294
00:14:23,694 --> 00:14:24,718
Mmm-hmm.

295
00:14:24,795 --> 00:14:26,126
And then,
after he spoke with you,

296
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:28,757
for some reason, it felt
like things had changed.

297
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:31,199
Hmm. That's weird.
That's weird.

298
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:33,931
Kind of weirding me out.

299
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,735
Did you know that Lincoln's
secretary was named Kennedy?

300
00:14:36,807 --> 00:14:39,139
Michael,
did you say anything?

301
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,172
Tell you what,
when you leave this office,

302
00:14:42,246 --> 00:14:44,373
I'm going to call Wallace
and I'm going to tell him

303
00:14:44,448 --> 00:14:46,211
that you should
get that promotion.

304
00:14:46,284 --> 00:14:47,376
Really?
Yes.

305
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:48,850
You will?
Yes.

306
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:50,409
Wanna do it right now?

307
00:14:50,488 --> 00:14:51,477
Yes.

308
00:14:52,657 --> 00:14:55,353
I tried to keep
Michael in the dark.

309
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:01,089
I should have known that he can
do just as much damage in the dark.

310
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,594
I need to see
your pupils.

311
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,100
I have to see if
they're dilating...

312
00:15:04,168 --> 00:15:05,897
Toby! Dwight!

313
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,099
Is that them?

314
00:15:08,172 --> 00:15:09,366
Definitely.

315
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:13,443
You come to my house,
bust up my trash cans,

316
00:15:13,511 --> 00:15:16,412
call my baby sister an ass
and told her to eat dog food?

317
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,175
We thought that
she was you.

318
00:15:18,249 --> 00:15:20,444
Why would you think
a lady is me?

319
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:28,683
Are you serious? Because
you look exactly alike.

320
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:29,953
Am I the only one?
- That's too far...

321
00:15:30,027 --> 00:15:31,892
Are you getting this?
I mean...

322
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:32,951
I don't see it.

323
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,827
Here's what
I'm gonna do.

324
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,357
I'm calling corporate and I'm filing
a complaint against both of you.

325
00:15:38,436 --> 00:15:39,664
Oh, Darryl.

326
00:15:39,737 --> 00:15:40,897
Come on, Gwyneth.

327
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:43,264
Sad.

328
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:46,299
<i>This is David.</i>

329
00:15:47,144 --> 00:15:49,135
Hey, David,
this is Michael...

330
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,981
<i>Michael Scott here.
Yeah.</i>

331
00:15:52,049 --> 00:15:54,313
Just wanted to talk to
you about Jim Halpert.

332
00:15:54,385 --> 00:15:58,446
I understand that he did
not receive that promotion,

333
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,490
and I wanted to see
what I could do

334
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,958
to nudge you in the right direction.

335
00:16:03,561 --> 00:16:06,155
<i>So, what, you're changing
your mind about Jim?</i>

336
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,860
Absolutely not!
Like I said before,

337
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:14,427
Jim is fantastic
and he deserves this job.

338
00:16:15,406 --> 00:16:17,670
<i>Michael, it seems like
you're cutting in and out.</i>

339
00:16:17,742 --> 00:16:20,734
<i>This is not what
you said earlier.</i>

340
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:22,438
What... Here's the thing.

341
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,048
Jim is the best
man for this job.

342
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:26,413
I think you should
give it to him.

343
00:16:26,484 --> 00:16:28,748
<i>Well, it doesn't change what
you showed me in Jim's file.</i>

344
00:16:28,819 --> 00:16:30,184
What?
Well...

345
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:33,688
That was an anomaly.

346
00:16:34,358 --> 00:16:40,024
That file had been falsified.
Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.

347
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,031
<i>Michael, I really don't know
what's going on down there, but...</i>

348
00:16:43,167 --> 00:16:44,725
<i>Oh, damn it!</i>

349
00:16:44,802 --> 00:16:48,329
<i>I am getting pulled over for
talking on my cell. Damn it!</i>

350
00:16:52,143 --> 00:16:56,580
Hey, Darryl, look,
we're here to apologize.

351
00:16:56,647 --> 00:16:57,841
We're cool.
- Wait.

352
00:16:57,915 --> 00:17:00,145
They're using the lift as
their own personal elevator.

353
00:17:00,217 --> 00:17:01,809
What?
He broke his ankle

354
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,979
climbing over the railing,
then he lied about it

355
00:17:04,054 --> 00:17:06,818
because it was a misuse
of company equipment.

356
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,381
Case closed.

357
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:09,892
Stupidest thing
I ever heard.

358
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,828
Really? Then why is there
new wood only on one railing?

359
00:17:15,032 --> 00:17:17,728
Let's just check
the security tapes, Toby.

360
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:21,629
Well, you know, I don't think
there's any reason to check them,

361
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:24,902
but I suppose if we wanted
to be really certain.

362
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:27,239
All right. Yeah.
Fine, so whatever.

363
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:28,300
Yes!

364
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,607
You really did it.

365
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:33,377
Now, I would like to file an
official complaint to corporate

366
00:17:33,451 --> 00:17:36,852
because Darryl lied
on an official form.

367
00:17:36,921 --> 00:17:39,481
And I'm telling them you guys
sexually harassed my sister.

368
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:42,788
No judge
is gonna believe that.

369
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,559
Okay.

370
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,565
Look, we could all file
complaints against each other

371
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:52,397
and just drown in a sea
of paperwork, but,

372
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:55,667
you know, we'll just
move on with our lives.

373
00:17:56,941 --> 00:18:01,844
So, Dwight and Darryl came to an
agreement that they would both file

374
00:18:01,912 --> 00:18:03,436
complaints
with corporate,

375
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:06,142
and now I get to do
all this paperwork.

376
00:18:07,518 --> 00:18:09,145
We worked it out.

377
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:15,185
Hey, hey, Jim. It would make
me feel really good right now

378
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:18,626
if you would just punch me in
the face, all right? Just do it.

379
00:18:18,696 --> 00:18:20,186
How many times
have I asked you

380
00:18:20,264 --> 00:18:21,731
to put me up for
a branch manager job?

381
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:24,768
I never recommended you because
I didn't want to lose you.

382
00:18:24,835 --> 00:18:26,496
And I didn't
want to lose Pam.

383
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,128
Now I don't want
to lose the baby.

384
00:18:28,205 --> 00:18:30,105
So, instead,
you screwed me?

385
00:18:30,174 --> 00:18:32,233
That's what she said.
No.

386
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:34,399
David Wallace
is calling.

387
00:18:34,478 --> 00:18:35,604
We're kind of in the
middle of something here.

388
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:36,668
Should I tell him
you'll call back?

389
00:18:36,747 --> 00:18:39,944
Yeah. No.
I'll tell him myself.

390
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:41,907
Let's both.

391
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:47,112
Hello?

392
00:18:47,191 --> 00:18:48,419
<i>Hey, Michael.
Yes.</i>

393
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:49,652
<i>You got Jim
there with you?</i>

394
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,194
No, it's just us.

395
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:54,129
<i>Actually, can you call Jim in?
I want him on this. Please.</i>

396
00:18:54,198 --> 00:18:56,792
Oh! Well, here
he is right now.

397
00:18:58,068 --> 00:18:59,296
Come in.

398
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:06,843
Hi, David.

399
00:19:06,911 --> 00:19:09,778
<i>Hey, guys.
So, I spoke to Alan.</i>

400
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:13,305
<i>We had kind of an unconventional
idea, which I think is pretty cool.</i>

401
00:19:13,384 --> 00:19:15,944
<i>But it only works if
everyone's onboard.</i>

402
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,682
Well, just as long as it
means Jim becomes a manager.

403
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:22,055
<i>We were thinking of having two
branch managers in Scranton.</i>

404
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,560
<i>Both of you guys
working as co-managers.</i>

405
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:25,993
<i>Jim would handle
the day-to-day,</i>

406
00:19:26,063 --> 00:19:29,430
<i>and Michael, you would focus on
clients and big picture stuff.</i>

407
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,728
Wow!
That sounds pretty cool.

408
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:32,029
I like that!

409
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,899
So, manager
and co-manager.

410
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:36,064
<i>Co-manager and co-manager.</i>

411
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,630
<i>See, there are a lot
of moving pieces</i>

412
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,074
<i>and this is the only way
I can sell it upstairs.</i>

413
00:19:40,144 --> 00:19:41,907
Well, that might be a
little confusing for people

414
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,140
because they
know me as manager.

415
00:19:44,815 --> 00:19:48,114
<i>All right, hey, Michael, can
you pick up for one second?</i>

416
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:51,583
<i>Okay, look, I'm not going
to force you into anything.</i>

417
00:19:51,655 --> 00:19:53,816
<i>If you're willing
to lose Jim, fine.</i>

418
00:19:53,891 --> 00:19:56,985
<i>You just say so. We'll
find another solution. Okay?</i>

419
00:19:57,895 --> 00:19:59,988
<i>Is that what
you want to do?</i>

420
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,197
Okay, people, listen up!
- Okay, everybody.

421
00:20:08,272 --> 00:20:10,263
I have an announcement to make.

422
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:11,569
Fraud was committed in... Whoa!

423
00:20:11,642 --> 00:20:12,631
Do you have
an announcement?

424
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,075
I was making it.

425
00:20:14,144 --> 00:20:16,977
Everybody, David Wallace
and I have talked,

426
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:21,040
and we have decided to promote
Jim to the position of co-manager.

427
00:20:21,785 --> 00:20:22,877
Co-manager of what?

428
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:24,784
Of your butt!

429
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:29,392
And your butt, and your butt, and your
butt. All of Scranton branch butts.

430
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,984
What's happening
to you, Michael?

431
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:32,187
What's happening to me?

432
00:20:32,262 --> 00:20:34,696
I am also being
promoted to co-manager.

433
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:37,131
We will be
co-managers together.

434
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:41,233
Jim Halpert, welcome.

435
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:42,670
Thank you.

436
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:54,246
Niagara Falls in October?
Hells yeah!

437
00:20:54,318 --> 00:20:57,754
Do you think that you could
send in your RSVP card?

438
00:20:57,821 --> 00:20:59,254
No. I'll just
tell you now. Easier.

439
00:20:59,323 --> 00:21:01,655
Well, you have to
choose a food option,

440
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,216
and there's information in there
about directions and lodging.

441
00:21:04,294 --> 00:21:07,161
I'll just have whatever's
fanciest, unless there's ribs,

442
00:21:07,231 --> 00:21:09,825
and I'll just get all the other
information the day of. I'll text you.

443
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,926
You are going to text me
the morning of my wedding

444
00:21:13,003 --> 00:21:14,470
to ask for directions...
Mmm-hmm. Right.

445
00:21:14,538 --> 00:21:16,836
...and you will eat
whatever is fanciest?

446
00:21:16,907 --> 00:21:18,238
Unless there's ribs.

447
00:21:19,576 --> 00:21:20,634
Rude.

448
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,611
So rude, right?
Mmm-hmm.

449
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,979
Oh, my gosh. I have been
chasing people down all day.

450
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:27,039
It's incredible.

451
00:21:27,117 --> 00:21:28,778
Pam, my bag was there.
