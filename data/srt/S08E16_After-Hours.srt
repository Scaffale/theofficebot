1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:02,501
Hey, Angela

2
00:00:02,585 --> 00:00:03,794
you wanna see
a picture of Philip

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,212
wearing those little
booties you got us?

4
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,214
So cute

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,592
Hey, you guys wanna see a picture
of Gerald wearing galoshes?

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,512
He refused to go out in the
rain until I bought these

7
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,931
Now, going out in the rain
is all he wants to do

8
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,394
Oscar thinks having a dog
is just like having a baby.

9
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,854
News flash,
if you didn't carry

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,397
it around in your
belly for nine months

11
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,523
it isn't your kid

12
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:25,983
Exactly

13
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,860
Unless you adopted
of course.

14
00:00:27,986 --> 00:00:29,445
That is where we disagree

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,114
Hey, are your little
dudes crawling yet?

16
00:00:32,198 --> 00:00:35,034
No. Three-month-old
humans don't do that

17
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,619
My Philip is crawling

18
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,498
Angela is such a liar

19
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,833
It's maddening

20
00:00:44,085 --> 00:00:46,045
Exactly, that's just
like crate training.

21
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,130
All night long
All night long

22
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:49,798
Well, count yourself lucky

23
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,175
Wait until you have two

24
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,094
That's two sleep schedules,
two naps that don't coincide

25
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:56,221
I mean,
you'll never sleep again

26
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,223
No one said
you must have two

27
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,892
Like her genes
are so important

28
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:02,644
The world just needs more
Pam-Jim DNA Thank you, no.

29
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,063
No, thank you

30
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:09,735
Check this out My brother
just got a new sailboat

31
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,238
He has no idea what he
just got himself into.

32
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,616
There's nothing harder
than taking care of a boat

33
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,326
Am I right?

34
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,827
Unbelievable!
Unbelievable

35
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,954
Unbelievable

36
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:35,385
It is the end of the day.
It is the end of the week

37
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,098
We managed to fill
40 hours, somehow

38
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,307
That's not bad, is it?

39
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,476
That's great
Pretty good.

40
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,521
Well, thank you
this is very helpful feedback

41
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,856
Dwight, I am still not
ready to name the V.P

42
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,608
That's not what
I was gonna ask

43
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,819
Gosh, you jump to conclusions

44
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,446
Come on, I know. You've
got so much on your plate

45
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,906
it's right now you're like

46
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:59,118
"Oh, what's more important Dwight's
question figure out who's the V.P

47
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,370
"Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P.'

48
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,831
Dwight. V.P. Dwight. V.P

49
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:10,462
Can we at least eliminate those
that are not in the running?

50
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,340
Free them up to focus
more completely on the menial

51
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,592
Like stacking
and sorting, or

52
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,177
Catching butterflies?

53
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,887
That's a hobby.
Unless it's for food

54
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,722
Theater
A waste of time.

55
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,057
Dragging?

56
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,267
That's just a verb

57
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:24,351
Dragging sticks

58
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,519
Yes. Nice. Perfect

59
00:02:25,603 --> 00:02:26,979
Dragging sticks

60
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,273
All right, I'm gonna eliminate
three people right now.

61
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,608
Okay? Just. You three. No

62
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,361
Not good enough

63
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:39,908
English people's main use today
is judging American talent.

64
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,953
"You're crap.
You're wonderful.'

65
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:45,497
They're mean,
but they're incisive

66
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,542
Everyone meet in
the hotel bar at 7:00

67
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,586
I'm not allowed to
say it's mandatory

68
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,671
So let's just
call it compulsory

69
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,048
I'll be there at 6:00

70
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,342
Ugh. We're gonna have one of
those crazy nights aren't we?

71
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,760
Maybe we'll see
the real Talla-nasty

72
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,179
we've been
hearing so much about

73
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,763
Talla-nasty. Very clever

74
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,307
Thank you.
Wait, wait

75
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:05,559
You think she
invented "Talla-nasty"?

76
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:07,895
No, no, no, no

77
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:12,941
Cathy? It's been
great, fun, normal

78
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,611
gonna be hanging out
with Stanley on this trip

79
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,946
but he's turned out
to be kind of a loose cannon.

80
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,781
My friend and I
are new here in Tallahassee

81
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,742
Would you like
to get a cocktail?

82
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,621
Maybe go out for a little dancing?
Beautiful day, no?

83
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,999
Okay, everybody.
5:00. Work day's over

84
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:32,920
Put your pencils down,
and bring 'em back up

85
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:36,006
Because now, the late
night work jam begins

86
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,925
Yes! The conference
room is set up.

87
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,469
I've got pens, I've got paper
I've got a whiteboard!

88
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,845
We are good to go

89
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,013
Say what?

90
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,431
We are good to go

91
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,475
Say what?
Good to go!

92
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:47,976
Stop it
Andy

93
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,103
Tonight, we're staying late
to service the accounts

94
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,396
of the people who
went on the Florida trip

95
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,856
Yes, of course
we could have just

96
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,358
been doing this
the whole time,

97
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,610
but someone dropped the ball

98
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,947
Ball droppings
can be beautiful

99
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,201
For example, when it turns an awkward
soprano into a rich, full tenor.

100
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,497
Jason Bourne
would kick Bond's ass

101
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,583
Jason Bourne has
no support staff

102
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,252
his own government's
out to get him.

103
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:14,753
Genghis Khan could
take 'em both down,

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,338
'cause he's not
afraid to kill children

105
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:20,175
What? It's true

106
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,719
He would eviscerate
babies and hang them

107
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,429
from poles
outside of the villages

108
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,058
Okay, drinking game The count
of three, take three sips

109
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,436
That's a stupid game I got a
great drinking game Okay?

110
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,938
Everyone, empty your pockets

111
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:35,190
Whoever has
the most seeds is the king

112
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:38,151
whoever has the least buttons
is the hunchback.

113
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,778
What happens if
you're the hunchback?

114
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,071
Oh, you get kicked

115
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,322
How many buttons do you have?

116
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:43,991
Forty. Always

117
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,701
Can I see?
Sure.

118
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,703
So I get to kick you now

119
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,871
No, they're not transferable just
'cause I handed them to you.

120
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,039
Well, that's how I
played it in college

121
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,207
College rules

122
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:56,837
And he lost at
his own lame game

123
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,047
Ooh! Double meaning

124
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,134
The game was lame and now
he's lame from the kick.

125
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,052
Quick wit.
Thank you

126
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,056
a glass of your oakiest
chardonnay, please.

127
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,810
And I will have a waffle
With your maple-iest syrup

128
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,979
Sorry, no waffles

129
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,733
Okay, just forget it then
Forget it. Forget it?

130
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,568
Waffle?

131
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,903
A hotel waffle.
I know what I wanna eat

132
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,530
Is that crazy?
No

133
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,574
I'm moving down here
you know

134
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,827
Oh. No, I didn't know

135
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,330
I'm young and I can

136
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,582
And if I can't,
I'm still pretty young

137
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,337
You come with me We're
gonna get you that waffle

138
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,174
Why would Erin confide in me that
she's staying here in Florida

139
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:45,177
if she didn't want me to make some
sort of last ditch, nothing-to-lose

140
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,928
Kelly Ka-who run at her?

141
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:48,555
Hey
Hey

142
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,557
Watson Carpet & Tile

143
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,933
One order

144
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:56,021
Order reference
number 00983-126

145
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,357
Eight cases
Bright White Inkjet

146
00:05:58,441 --> 00:05:59,399
Paid

147
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,151
I'm dying

148
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,113
Processed
And delivered.

149
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,741
Sometimes I get so bored
I just wanna scream

150
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,951
And then sometimes
I actually do scream.

151
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,371
What the situation calls for

152
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,213
Hey, I see what you're doing It's
futile The V.P. position is mine.

153
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,048
Oh, please, you're through

154
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:27,052
She's going to give it to me as
I'm giving it to her tonight

155
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,472
The cowgirl has
chosen her saddle

156
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,185
Well, saddles

157
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,063
...sometimes fall off

158
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,857
Especially if you don't
properly cinch the girth

159
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:44,611
What? That's a joke, right? You
see the way she's all over me.

160
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:50,659
If anyone's having sex with
Nellie for personal gain, it's me

161
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,619
And I'm not joking at all

162
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:55,247
If you don't tighten your
saddle you may fall off.

163
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:57,958
Who is ready for dinner?

164
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:03,004
"Oh, I bet it's pizza or tacos
or something stupid."No

165
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,757
I went south of
the border for this

166
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,259
and then I went
south of that border

167
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,179
and we have ourselves
a Jamaican feast, man

168
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,349
If I wanted Jamaican food
I'd just hire

169
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,184
a bunch of
bodyguards and go there

170
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,605
Additional trivia factoid this
food comes to us through Val,

171
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,692
and our server is none other
than Brandon her boyf.

172
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:25,360
Hey

173
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:26,653
How you doing, guys?

174
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,158
Jamaican, huh? I just read
about the elections down there

175
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,242
Crazy stuff

176
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,577
Oh, no. I'm not
actually Jamaican

177
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,953
Terrific

178
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,788
What's up, man? I'm Darryl

179
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,248
Oh, Darryl
I heard about you

180
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:39,708
You doing good?
Oh, yeah

181
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,751
You must be doing real good
since you're * my girlfriend.

182
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,628
Whoa

183
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,215
Dude, you didn't tell me
you were * Val High five!

184
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,633
I'm not sleeping
with your girlfriend

185
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,093
Brandon, what the he
are you talking about?

186
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,511
Don't play dumb with me I know what's up.

187
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,596
Honey, I am not sleeping

188
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,308
Hey! Hey.
Let's get back to the food

189
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,810
Brandon, tell us about
these delicious-looking goops

190
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,188
Hope you all like goat

191
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,023
Goat

192
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,151
Blow in my ear.
All right

193
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,819
Like I'm on the beach

194
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:13,909
A seagull

195
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,786
And a wave crashing

196
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,456
A wave crashing

197
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,834
Oh, that is lovely

198
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,713
All right, that's
gonna do it for me tonight

199
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,673
Have a lovely evening

200
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,229
Hey, how's it going?

201
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,024
Good. The heating system, though,
in my room is all messed up

202
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,442
It's like 90 degrees
in there

203
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,111
Maintenance is working on it
Can I hang out in here?

204
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,572
Uh... Yeah, I'm just
watching basketball

205
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,824
Okay. Yeah.
Okay

206
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,284
Cool

207
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,164
Is this March Madness?
I love March Madness.

208
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:05,126
Oh, no. That's not this.
Because that's in March

209
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,713
This is just the NBA
professional.

210
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,550
Miami Heat, actually. So

211
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,385
LeBron James
Yes

212
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:16,763
Nice, good word association

213
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,152
Impressive

214
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,405
Oh, please
anyone can tie a knot

215
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,157
The real skill
is in untying it

216
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,537
Thornwood Wholesalers

217
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,580
One order

218
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:42,914
I read the texts
you sent to Val, man

219
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:44,624
That's messed up

220
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,917
Is this spicy?

221
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,586
No, baby girl.
It would be messed up

222
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:49,337
if I didn't find anything
But I did, so

223
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:52,257
I'm pretty sure if
Darryl sent Val a text

224
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,718
it was about some paper
emergency or something

225
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,802
At midnight?

226
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:58,763
It happens

227
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,099
Like, a hospital needs
more napkins for surgery

228
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,726
You guys, we're not gonna
settle anything this way.

229
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:05,061
I think we just need to be
grown-ups here. Thank you

230
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,521
I think we're gonna
need to hear those texts

231
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,107
Kelly, remember how you wanted
to go home before?

232
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,610
No. There's no way
in hell I'm leaving.

233
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,278
Something interesting
is happening here

234
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,030
For once in my life I am staying here.

235
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,281
Darryl, read the texts

236
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,578
Yep? Coming

237
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,874
All right Hey. My minibar
is oddly out of rum.

238
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,042
We have plenty

239
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,294
Oh. Hello.

240
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,130
You wanna watch the game with us?
We're watching a game

241
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,757
The Heat game
It's just a game.

242
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:35,592
Got it. Good night

243
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,386
Careful, Jim
it gets easier and easier

244
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,681
No. No, no. Stanley?
Stanley. Stanley?

245
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,433
Stanley. All right. Hey

246
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,602
You know. Just bring
back those bottles!

247
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,064
Huh. The lights
are still on.

248
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,565
Yeah. They keep
them on, 'cause it's

249
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,067
less expensive than
turning them on and off

250
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,861
I like how guys just
know stuff all the time

251
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,446
Girls know a lot
of stuff too, okay?

252
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,073
And nobody
knows more than you

253
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,532
Especially me

254
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:04,162
Hello, waffle iron

255
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,081
Hello! What do
we have here?

256
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:07,999
Okay, so the recipe
says we need

257
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,001
a mixing bowl,
a measuring cup

258
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:12,754
Get down

259
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,840
It's the fuzz

260
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,217
Do you want us
to get scolded?

261
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,553
Shut your beautiful,
beautiful mouth. Please

262
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,101
"I got too much ice cream
you want some?"

263
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,395
"Getting my fry on.'

264
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,688
Boring

265
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:31,398
"The moon is huge tonight.'

266
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,191
Gosh, the moon one's damning

267
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,567
Yeah, sorry

268
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,194
That's regular text talk

269
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,362
You forgot one

270
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:38,988
"You're such a great friend.'

271
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,281
With the dots

272
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:43,076
"You're such a great friend
dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.'

273
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:46,454
Five dots, Darryl?
Are you kidding me?

274
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,040
Okay, 'cause three dots means to
be continued four dots is a typo.

275
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,834
But five dots means
"Whoa, do not

276
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,711
make me say what I
want to say, baby

277
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,548
"but if I did it would blow your
mind dot, dot, dot, dot, dot."

278
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,591
See? Yes, thank you, sister

279
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,553
Brandon, Darryl and me
that's ridiculous

280
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,638
Right?
Yeah

281
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:07,392
Totally crazy. Puts me in an insane
asylum just thinking about it.

282
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,310
I'm stranded on
Shutter Island over here

283
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,189
You look like Ed Harris

284
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,983
If they stretched
him a little bit...

285
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,361
You wanna see a picture of me
trapped under a tree?

286
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,073
Uh.

287
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,409
Excuse me

288
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:25,785
What? Not now. I'm busy

289
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,078
I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know

290
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,329
that I saw
a bedbug in my room.

291
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,748
But never mind.
Sorry to interrupt.

292
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,332
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Bedbugs?

293
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,793
Oh, no

294
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:39,716
Freak, I need a favor

295
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,845
Well, then you have to call me
by my name Gabriel Susan Lewis

296
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:44,929
I've gotta be gone
for a few minutes.

297
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,182
You make sure that Packer
does not sleep with Nellie.

298
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,392
What's in it for G.S.L.?

299
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,810
You really want
Packer as your boss?

300
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,103
Got it

301
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:55,398
If Jim has bedbugs,
that means they're everywhere

302
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,817
I can't risk them coming
back to Schrute Farms.

303
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,695
Our biggest attraction is our
200-hundred-year-old mattresses.

304
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,574
Where did you see it?
In the bed

305
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,034
Well, I haven't seen anything

306
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,745
We gotta find it
before it eggs.

307
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,913
Jeez

308
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,875
Describe it
Brown, shiny, painful bite

309
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,043
Could be a bat weevil

310
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,712
Describe its mood.
Did it seem sleepy?

311
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,298
Stressed, but to be fair
it was a tense situation

312
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,675
Fair enough But after it bit
you did it run away fearful?

313
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,178
Or did it walk away smug
self-assured?

314
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,556
So smug. Like he thought
it was funny. Like this

315
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,266
That's a bedbug.
Yeah

316
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,018
Everything's a joke.
I know

317
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,102
Check your hair

318
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,524
God! It's so greasy You
should just shave all this

319
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,608
Just check it

320
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,444
You are clean. Okay

321
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,365
The one thing a bedbug thrives
on is heat and carbon dioxide

322
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,160
I am gonna generate myself
into a human trap

323
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,246
When I jump into the bed
you are gonna

324
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,414
cover me with
the sheet immediately

325
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,834
And then,
we'll see who's laughing

326
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:56,960
All right

327
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,504
Yeah

328
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:00,755
Cover me

329
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,090
Is this really necessary?

330
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,258
He knows what he's doing

331
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,010
Let the bedbugs bite

332
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,012
God! I feel so gross
I have to go take a shower

333
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,931
All right
then I will catch you later

334
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,183
What do we do now?

335
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,309
We wait

336
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,729
Come to Papa

337
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,190
No

338
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,619
No, I wasn't bitten

339
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,705
Okay, well, maybe it's not
warm enough in here

340
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,789
It's plenty warm

341
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,624
And I was farting continuously
under the sheet

342
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,126
creating a kind of a
greenhouse effect. Come on

343
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,752
If there were any
in here, they would

344
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:40,879
have imbedded
themselves in me

345
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,630
You know what?
Maybe they just ate

346
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,424
No, you're good.
Clean bill of health

347
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,175
Besides, I gotta
get back downstairs

348
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,678
I left Packer alone with
Nellie for way too long.

349
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,638
Okay, well, they're
fine, they're adults

350
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,181
No. That's the problem

351
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:55,810
Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the V.P.
job, unless I do it first.

352
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,312
Is that really how you
want to get this job?

353
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,063
Such a chorus girl

354
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,692
Okay, Dwight? Dwight?
Dwight, Dwight, Dwight

355
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,319
Uh.

356
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,365
Is "crazy" gone?

357
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,673
Oh

358
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,012
They don't make these cords
in boot cut anymore!

359
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,682
Aw

360
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,018
Pathetic, huh?

361
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,730
A real man swallows his vomit
when a lady is present.

362
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:46,402
Hey

363
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,366
Yep, one Death by Chocolate
one Bananas Foster.

364
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:52,909
Okay, cool. Thanks

365
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,499
Wait, this is why I
exercise like a fiend

366
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,042
Feel. Seriously

367
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,669
Okay. All right

368
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,129
I'm really sorry. I just have to say it

369
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,631
I'm married

370
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,508
I'm very happily married

371
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,343
Oh, my God,
what are you thinking?

372
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,512
Um

373
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,685
How little do you
think of me?

374
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:23,106
I'm sorry, I feel like
maybe I misread things

375
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,734
Okay. Let's just
go back to watching

376
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:30,279
Can you without running to the
other side of the room all night?

377
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,700
Yes. I can. Uh

378
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,661
All right.
I'm really sorry

379
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,579
I think we'll just
We'll just watch

380
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,206
You can watch, not watch
whatever you wanna do.

381
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,333
Take another shower I don't care.
Okay.

382
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,044
Whoo

383
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,178
Hey, Darryl, you okay?

384
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,722
She's got a boyfriend

385
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,307
Play it cool, man
She'll come around

386
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,185
No, you should go for it.
Mmm

387
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,062
I mean, nothing would've
happened with me and Jim

388
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,397
if he didn't put
himself out there

389
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:09,110
Yeah, but my friend Jim would
tell you to play it cool

390
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,697
My husband would
tell you to go for it

391
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,034
Hey. Hey
Hey. Hey

392
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,869
This is fun
A lot of fun.

393
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,288
I know. Can I give
you a compliment?

394
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,707
I'm really impressed
by how much you've grown

395
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,792
Since I met you
it's like night and day

396
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:27,211
You should move down
here with me Yeah?

397
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,796
We could be roommates
Really?

398
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:31,883
We could get a dog
we could go to R-rated movies

399
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:34,385
And who knows, I mean
you're a guy, I'm a girl.

400
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,511
Yeah

401
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,389
Maybe in six months, we'll see.
Six months

402
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,892
Okay. I'm in love
with Kelly

403
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:48,649
Put your forehead near mine and
see if you can read my thoughts.

404
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,443
Okay

405
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:54,238
Seven, one, one

406
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,117
Nine No, no, no not numbers. No

407
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:01,621
No, okay. Try again

408
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,414
Okay

409
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,794
I'm still getting numbers
Seven, one, one...

410
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,506
Is anyone around here thinking
the numbers seven, one, one?

411
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:14,258
Please stop. Okay?

412
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,260
Dwight, give me
a key card to your room

413
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:23,226
Meet me in seven minutes
for some one-on-one time

414
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,519
Wait, the numbers

415
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,110
There you go
I will see you in seven

416
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,903
Seven minutes

417
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:43,913
Nellie, wait

418
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,793
Let me write my room
number on the card

419
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,714
Win at all costs.
Don't respect women.

420
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,385
These are the tenets p was brought up
with, and they have served me well.

421
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:00,805
But my ancestors never worked
in corporate America.

422
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,016
They were farmers,
and before that, hunters,

423
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:09,605
and before that, time travellers,
and before that, me again.

424
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,357
At least that's
how the legend goes.

425
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,569
The point is, they never had to
worry about how they got ahead.

426
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,364
They just had to put food on the
table and not alter the past

427
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:22,785
1434-967, paid

428
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,453
It has been processed

429
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,164
It has been delivered

430
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,000
That's it, last one

431
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,502
Andy, this has been
an amazing night. Epic

432
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,337
Cool down fiesta
begins right now

433
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,464
I got decaf coffee
No way

434
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,342
I've got Romy and Michele's
High School Reunion.

435
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,428
Hey

436
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:45,975
Can we just like
never talk about it again?

437
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,143
Sure
Okay, thanks.

438
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,146
Hey, just so you know
me and you,

439
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:55,318
I don't think that's ridiculous.
Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot

440
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,667
All right. Now I think
it's time for you to go

441
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,545
What? Jim

442
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,505
I thought we talked about
this You're cool, right?

443
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,049
Cathy! Go

444
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,219
Where's the bug?
Awesome

445
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,012
Stand back

446
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,097
Stop it! Oh, my gosh!
That burns! What is that?

447
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,600
It's a compound of chemicals I
pulled off of the maid's cart.

448
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,644
Oh, my God!
Dwight, there

449
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,104
Oh, God! Stop it! Stop it

450
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,397
Big one! Big one

451
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,567
Stop it

452
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,487
Nice job, I think
you got him.

453
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,365
You can't stay here
this place is a biohazard

454
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,659
If I were you
I'd just bunk with Cathy

455
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,671
Second best Bananas
Foster I've ever had.

456
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,506
Yeah, what's the first best?

457
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:03,219
Dwight?

458
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,513
Hello? Dwight?

459
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,640
Is that Nellie?
Don't!

460
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,100
Are you in there?

461
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:11,560
On under your door

462
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,355
Hello?

463
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,941
Oh, look at that

464
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,027
The light went off just as
I said the light went on

465
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,865
Hello? Dwight?

466
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,162
Dwight?
