1
00:00:01,034 --> 00:00:02,935
I'm an early bird,
and I'm a night owl.

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:05,537
So I'm wise and I have worms.

3
00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:07,272
Now.

4
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:09,141
Oh! Breakfast.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:11,010
I got you your sausage,
egg, and cheese biscuit.

6
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:15,981
Yummy, yummy.
Thank you, Ryan.

7
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:19,385
What was the thing you
needed me to come in early for?

8
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,053
Um...

9
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:23,455
the sausage, egg,
and cheese biscuit.

10
00:00:23,457 --> 00:00:27,559
But thank you,
and why don't you just...

11
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,827
Take a couple of hours.

12
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:29,928
Office is yours.

13
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,431
Home Alone, Risky Business.

14
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:36,435
Take your pants off, run around.

15
00:00:36,437 --> 00:00:37,970
Whatever you wanna do.

16
00:00:37,972 --> 00:00:40,439
I'm just gonna take a nap
in my car till work starts.

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,540
Okay.

18
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:45,544
See? Healthier.

19
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,013
Gotta watch those carbs.

20
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:23,849
Today I, Michael Scott,
am becoming a homeowner.

21
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,284
Investing in real estate.

22
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:26,785
Diversifying.
Smart.

23
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,254
Yes, it is.
Yes, it is.

24
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,957
It is very important
to own property.

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,592
Back in olden days,

26
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,861
they would not even let you vote

27
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:37,229
unless you owned property.

28
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,832
They'd throw you in the stocks
and humiliate you.

29
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:40,866
And it worked.
Yes.

30
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,101
We should bring the stocks back.

31
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:43,135
People will obey the law.

32
00:01:43,137 --> 00:01:44,269
There'd be less troublemakers.

33
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,271
Maybe.

34
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:56,215
Every so often,
Jim dies of boredom.

35
00:01:56,217 --> 00:01:58,750
I think today it was
the expense reports

36
00:01:58,752 --> 00:02:00,385
that did him in.

37
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:01,753
And, uh, our deal is

38
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:04,022
that it's up to me
to revive him.

39
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:05,958
You see Dwight's coffee mug?
Mm-hmm.

40
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,326
Sometimes when he's not here,

41
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,027
I try to throw stuff in it.

42
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,663
No way.

43
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:13,899
Let's do this.

44
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:18,537
Oh!

45
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:22,074
Here.
Try paper clips.

46
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:23,976
Oh, wait.
This message.

47
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,644
For Dwight.

48
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:26,645
Perfect.

49
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,215
Uh!
Oh!

50
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,316
You should go.

51
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,417
Yes. Yes.

52
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,652
Final walkthrough.
Mm-hmm.

53
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:35,053
Sign the papers at the condo.

54
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,388
You have your lawyer there?

55
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,956
Uh, I don't need one.
Can I be your representative?

56
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,791
I don't need a representative.
I think I should be there.

57
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:40,893
No, no.
No, I'm good.

58
00:02:40,895 --> 00:02:42,127
I can make sure
things are up to code.

59
00:02:42,129 --> 00:02:43,428
No, Dwight. I'm fine.
Please?

60
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,130
I'm always the guy
that you rely on at work.

61
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,131
Well, this isn't about work.

62
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,466
This is closing on a condo.

63
00:02:47,468 --> 00:02:48,567
It's completely personal.

64
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,536
So you're taking a personal day?

65
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:52,804
Accept that

66
00:02:52,806 --> 00:02:54,373
this is about
my living arrangement,

67
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,807
and as boss,

68
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,876
I need to have
a living arrangement

69
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,111
in order to do work.

70
00:02:59,113 --> 00:03:00,479
Please?

71
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:02,147
I'll make you proud.

72
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:03,849
Okay, fine.
Yes, you can come.

73
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,917
Yes!
As your representative?

74
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,984
As my associate.

75
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,053
Same thing.
No, it is not.

76
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,621
I have been
Michael's number two guy

77
00:03:09,623 --> 00:03:11,523
for about five years.

78
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,258
And we make a great team.

79
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,527
We're like one of those
classic, famous teams.

80
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:16,562
He's like Mozart,

81
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:20,265
and I'm like... Mozart's friend.

82
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,300
No.

83
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,468
I'm like Butch Cassidy,

84
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,105
and Michael is like Mozart.

85
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:29,208
You try and hurt Mozart,

86
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:31,143
you're gonna get
a bullet in your head

87
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,111
courtesy of Butch Cassidy.

88
00:03:33,113 --> 00:03:36,248
Oh, most honorable Pamera.

89
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,651
Not offensive because that's
the way they talk in movies.

90
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,919
You headed out?
Uh, we are.

91
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:42,421
Dwight and I are going
to the big thing.

92
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:44,723
So why don't you have everybody

93
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,258
work on their expense reports,

94
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,360
and I'd like them in
by the end of the day.

95
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,461
Okay.
Very good.

96
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:50,562
Have a great time.
We will.

97
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:51,630
Um, did you do the thing

98
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,131
I asked you to do
about the magazines?

99
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,533
Yeah, I changed them
to your new address.

100
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,901
Good. The...

101
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,269
Small Businessman?
Yep.

102
00:03:57,271 --> 00:04:00,405
Maxim? American Way?

103
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:01,540
Cracked?

104
00:04:01,542 --> 00:04:02,841
Yes.

105
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,611
I changed your Cracked
magazine subscription.

106
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:08,480
How about m... uh,

107
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:13,585
Fine Arts...
Aficionado Monthly?

108
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,853
No? Okay.

109
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,221
Well, could you get on that?

110
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,823
'Cause I don't
just read Cracked.

111
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,191
Thank you.

112
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:21,026
Okay.
See you soon.

113
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,061
What kinda shocks
you got on this baby?

114
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,631
I don't know.
Regular, normal ones.

115
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,799
Nothin' fancy.

116
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:29,835
Not my style.

117
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,103
What are you doin'?

118
00:04:31,105 --> 00:04:32,271
I wanna put the top down.

119
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,939
No, Dwight.
It's 50 degrees outside.

120
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:35,040
Don't... Please.

121
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:36,808
Yeah, but then
no one can see us.

122
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,144
I... Just, would you
put it up?

123
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:41,380
Okay. Fine.

124
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:42,714
Just leave it down.

125
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,183
Whiner.

126
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,818
Check it out.

127
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,587
Terminator.

128
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,790
I do not understand
what you spend your money on.

129
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,392
Ooh.

130
00:04:53,394 --> 00:04:54,526
Hey, Oscar.

131
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:55,627
Um, these new expense reports.

132
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,596
Do we really have to go back
to last quarter?

133
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,697
Yeah.

134
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,399
It's a terrible system, I know.

135
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,900
What?

136
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,303
What does "2005 season" mean?

137
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:05,370
Tha...

138
00:05:05,372 --> 00:05:06,938
Wait a minute.
What is this?

139
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,006
It's a scoreboard.

140
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,608
What?

141
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,209
Kevin and I play
this paper football game

142
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,344
when Michael's out.
Really?

143
00:05:12,346 --> 00:05:13,578
Yeah.
Or when we're bored.

144
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,347
Oh, my God!

145
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:17,516
Wait, this goes back two years!

146
00:05:17,518 --> 00:05:19,584
We're bored a lot.

147
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,987
Oh-ho.
Oh!

148
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,288
Sweet.
Yes!

149
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,990
So close.

150
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,358
I really love the, uh,

151
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,894
paper triangle flicking
and hitting things game.

152
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,395
Yeah.
We call it Hateball.

153
00:05:30,397 --> 00:05:31,697
Why?

154
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,599
Because of how much
Angela hates it.

155
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,035
Hey, do you guys have
any other games?

156
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:38,270
Sometimes we play

157
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:40,505
Who Can Put the Most m&ms
in Their Mouth?

158
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,407
You play that.

159
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:43,542
You should ask Toby

160
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,110
to teach you Dunderball.

161
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,113
Home sweet home.

162
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,882
Which one's yours?

163
00:05:50,884 --> 00:05:52,384
Right there.

164
00:05:52,386 --> 00:05:53,885
My sanctuary.

165
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55,420
My party pad.

166
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,856
Someday I can just see

167
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,092
my grandkids

168
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:01,960
learning how to walk out here.

169
00:06:01,962 --> 00:06:05,597
Hang a swing from this tree.

170
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:07,432
Push 'em back...

171
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:10,035
Wait.

172
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,237
No, it's this one right here.

173
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,005
Home sweet home.

174
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,078
So that's what
this sound is all day.

175
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,447
Michael, this is Bill.

176
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:24,015
He's the head
of the Condo Association.

177
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,117
Oh!
Hey, how are you?

178
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,284
Nice to meet you, Bill.

179
00:06:26,286 --> 00:06:27,419
Bill. Mr. Bill.

180
00:06:27,421 --> 00:06:29,855
Oh, no!

181
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:33,024
Mr. Bill!
Whoa! Ho-Ho!

182
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,593
SNL?

183
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,194
When they pull him apart?

184
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,765
He would always get
rolled over by something.

185
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,900
N-Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

186
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,535
This is smaller
than your old place.

187
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,837
Yes, well, I'm buying it
and I'm not renting it.

188
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,340
So it's still an upgrade.

189
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:52,277
He doesn't know anything
about property ownership.

190
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:53,812
He's kind of an idiot.
Um...

191
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,814
Actually, I do own property.

192
00:06:55,816 --> 00:06:56,982
My grandfather left me

193
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:59,017
a 60-acre working beet farm.

194
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,086
I run it with my cousin Mose.

195
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:03,422
We sell beets to local stores

196
00:07:03,424 --> 00:07:05,357
and restaurants.

197
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:06,658
It's a nice little farm.

198
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,496
Sometimes teenagers
use it for sex.

199
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,131
Are we ready
to sign some papers?

200
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:14,132
Actually, no.

201
00:07:14,134 --> 00:07:15,634
We have a couple of questions,

202
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:17,402
uh, about the neighborhood.

203
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:19,304
I-It's very safe.
It's very clean.

204
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:21,473
Uh, also, it's very accepting

205
00:07:21,475 --> 00:07:23,475
of all lifestyles.

206
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,612
It's a very gay-friendly
neighborhood.

207
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:31,316
Oh, good.
That's good.

208
00:07:31,318 --> 00:07:34,519
It's good to be
accommodating of... that.

209
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:37,756
Let's go check out
the master bedroom.

210
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,291
Stanley.

211
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:40,826
Just played Dunderball
with Toby...

212
00:07:40,828 --> 00:07:42,561
What about you?
Do you have any games?

213
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,029
Yeah, I got a game.

214
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:46,932
It's called Work Hard
So My Kids Can Go To College.

215
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,667
Fair enough.

216
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,837
This, my friends,

217
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,239
is the master bedroom.

218
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,707
Check out
the cathedral ceilings.

219
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,243
Those are, like, 17 feet high.

220
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,812
We have cable readiness
right there.

221
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,747
I am going to totally
pimp this place out.

222
00:08:02,749 --> 00:08:05,217
I am going to put
a surround sound system.

223
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:06,685
I am going to put
a plasma screen

224
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:08,153
right against this wall.

225
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,554
Ooh, terrible idea.

226
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,822
'Cause I'm putting my bed
right over here.

227
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,357
No, no, no, no, no.
This is a shared wall.

228
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,925
Neighbor throws
his wife into the wall,

229
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,760
plasma screen hits the floor,
totally smashed.

230
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,562
Well, the I will get a warranty.

231
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:19,431
Warranties don't cover it.
Plus, they're a rip-off.

232
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:20,765
Well, then I won't get a warranty.
Christina!

233
00:08:20,767 --> 00:08:22,701
Shh! So, that's the problem.
It's solved.

234
00:08:22,703 --> 00:08:24,603
What?
I don't hear you practicing.

235
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,704
Can you hear that?

236
00:08:27,441 --> 00:08:29,608
Oh, man!

237
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,043
These babies are thin!

238
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,422
This scented candle

239
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,724
...andle... andle...

240
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:48,493
Which I found in the men's
bathroom, room, room...

241
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:52,264
Represents the eternal...

242
00:08:52,266 --> 00:08:57,168
burning of competition
or something.

243
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,703
It smells like cookies.

244
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,171
Yes, it does.

245
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:02,674
Yes, it does, my friend.

246
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,209
Okay, we will be competing

247
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:06,478
for gold, silver, and bronze

248
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,879
yogurt lids.

249
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,681
Now, the bronze are really blue.

250
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,416
And they're also
the backside of the gold,

251
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,517
so no flipping.

252
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,419
Okay?
Honor system.

253
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,559
I do play games.

254
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,760
I sing.

255
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:24,062
And I dangle things
in front of my cats.

256
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,931
I play lots of games.

257
00:09:25,933 --> 00:09:27,766
Just not at work.

258
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:29,301
Let the games begin.

259
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,876
And then I just need you
to sign here at this arrow.

260
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:39,477
What kind of mortgage
did you get?

261
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,179
Uh, 10-year.

262
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,281
Well, 10 over 30,

263
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:44,683
so 30-year total.

264
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,585
What? Wha...

265
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:49,821
You said 10. S...

266
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,356
10-year fixed...

267
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:52,624
over 30.

268
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:54,292
30-year total.

269
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,727
Huh. 30 years.

270
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,195
Okay, okay, okay.

271
00:09:57,197 --> 00:10:00,165
Wow, you'll be payin' this off
in your mid 70s.

272
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:01,299
All right.

273
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,835
Forget about retiring
when you're 65.

274
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,070
Hey, I've got an idea.

275
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:06,271
You know that extra bedroom?

276
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:07,872
If the whole girlfriend thing
never happens,

277
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:09,274
that's where the nurse can live.

278
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,242
Okay, all right.

279
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,278
Oh, boy.
Well, this is it.

280
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,646
Whenever you're ready.

281
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:16,014
Yeah. Um...

282
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,850
Ho. Ho-okay.

283
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:20,185
Is that supposed to come off?

284
00:10:20,187 --> 00:10:21,987
Actually, yes. Hey, look, cool.
Carpenter ants.

285
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,823
Um... Gonna take
a little, uh, breather

286
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25,857
for a second.

287
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,258
Excuse me.

288
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,393
It'll be here waiting for you.

289
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:29,961
Oh, man.

290
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,229
A 30-year mortgage

291
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,464
at Michael's age

292
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:34,399
essentially means that he's
buying a coffin.

293
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,201
If I were buying my coffin,

294
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,269
I would get one
with thicker walls

295
00:10:38,271 --> 00:10:40,672
so you couldn't hear
the other dead people.

296
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:46,111
Oh!
Whenever you're ready, Michael.

297
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,679
Ugh!

298
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:50,615
You have what is
the national sport

299
00:10:50,617 --> 00:10:52,651
of Icelandic paper companies.

300
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:54,853
And I'm blanking on the name.

301
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,588
Could you help me out, Pam?

302
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,790
Jim, they refer to it as...

303
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,725
Flonkerton.

304
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:01,826
Hmm.

305
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:02,927
In English,

306
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:04,229
Box of Paper Snowshoe Racing.

307
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,664
Fair enough,

308
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,565
but I like Flonkerton.

309
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,368
The thing about Jim is,

310
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,070
when he's excited
about something,

311
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,638
like the office Olympics,

312
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,073
he gets really into it

313
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,676
and he does a really great job.

314
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:19,344
But the problem with Jim

315
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,745
is that he works here,

316
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:23,648
so that hardly ever happens.

317
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,117
So who will be challenging Kevin

318
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:27,385
in Flonkerton?

319
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,120
Anyone.

320
00:11:29,122 --> 00:11:30,188
I'll do it.

321
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,823
Yes! Phyllis!

322
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:37,295
Phyllis, if you'd just put
your foot right through here.

323
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:39,097
Right through the flonk.

324
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,100
The ceilings are lower
than they were last week.

325
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:43,234
That... I don't...

326
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:44,836
What?
I don't know if you showed me

327
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,071
this same unit or not.

328
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:48,139
Where... Michael, this is
the unit you saw, and...

329
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,542
Where are all the hot people?

330
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,110
I was told that there would be

331
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:53,678
all these attractive singles.

332
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,680
Who told you that?
And as far as I can tell,

333
00:11:55,682 --> 00:11:57,182
I'm the best-looking
person here.

334
00:11:57,184 --> 00:11:58,550
There's a basic principle
in real estate

335
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,251
that you should never be

336
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,153
the best-looking person
in the development.

337
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,655
It's just sorta common sense,

338
00:12:03,657 --> 00:12:04,856
because if you are,

339
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:09,427
then you have no place
to go but down.

340
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:10,628
Is this a financial thing?

341
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:11,930
If it's financial thing,

342
00:12:11,932 --> 00:12:13,865
what some people do is,
they rent out the third bedroom.

343
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,366
No, no. No, no, no, no.

344
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,601
And that's some
extra income for you.

345
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,336
I am not going to rent
the third bedroom.

346
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,173
I want a price reduction
or I am a-walkin'.

347
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:27,078
You will lose $7,000
if you walk away right now.

348
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,379
Muh...

349
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:31,583
I made the right decision.

350
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:33,151
I'm glad I signed.

351
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:34,552
The... I'm a homeowner.

352
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:36,054
Right?

353
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,655
Good to be a homeowner.
Diversifying.

354
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,457
This is good.

355
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,426
This is fun.
We're havin' fun.

356
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,627
Totally havin' fun.

357
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,028
Can you imagine those poor saps

358
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,497
stuck at the office today?

359
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,400
Here we go. Here we go.

360
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,003
Dig deep.

361
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:53,505
Dig deep!

362
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:56,141
Oh!

363
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,242
It's Phyllis!
It's Phyllis.

364
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:58,343
Phyllis by a nose.

365
00:12:58,345 --> 00:12:59,978
Gold medal in Flurnenton.

366
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,179
Flonkerton!

367
00:13:01,181 --> 00:13:03,214
Thank you,
delegate from Iceland.

368
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,189
Wow. Okay.

369
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:13,124
No one else should even try.

370
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,292
Gold medals.

371
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,494
Give him medals.

372
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,329
Wow!

373
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,133
There's somethin' else, Dwight,

374
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,735
wanted to talk to you about.

375
00:13:23,737 --> 00:13:25,470
I have a surprise for you.

376
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:26,738
For helpin' me out today.

377
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,506
Oh, you didn't have to do...
No.

378
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:29,707
No.
I insist, I insist.

379
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,209
Because you've really done
some great work.

380
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,377
Great work!

381
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,712
And that is why
I am going to let you

382
00:13:34,714 --> 00:13:37,081
move into my third bedroom

383
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,083
and pay me rent.

384
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,587
Why did I do it?

385
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:45,456
Because I believe in rewarding
people for their efforts.

386
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:48,893
Uh, I rewarded Dwight

387
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:50,528
with the room,

388
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,164
and he is rewarding me back

389
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,201
with, uh, $500 plus utilities.

390
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:58,269
I don't even know what to say.

391
00:13:58,271 --> 00:14:01,806
I'm thinkin', lock into
a four-year commitment.

392
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:03,541
We'll go month-to-month
after that.

393
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:05,476
Or until I start dating,

394
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:07,111
have a girlfriend.

395
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:08,413
And then you're, you know,

396
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:09,480
you're gone, so...

397
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:12,383
Question: Where can I put
my terrarium?

398
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,054
What hell is a terrarium?

399
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:18,656
It's a fish tank
for snakes and lizards.

400
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,358
Oh, so, an aquarium?

401
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,628
Uh, that...

402
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,064
will not come into this place.

403
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,632
Okay?
Question:

404
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:28,733
Oh, my God.

405
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,001
My grandparents left me

406
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:32,637
a large number of armoires.

407
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,072
Are you sure you don't
wanna play?

408
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,139
I'm sure.

409
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:36,941
Come on, Angela.
Don't you have a game?

410
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:39,077
I have one, yes.

411
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,212
Well, let's play.
What is it?

412
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,147
I call it Pam Pong.

413
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,483
I count how many times
Jim gets up from his desk

414
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:47,619
and goes to reception
to talk to you.

415
00:14:47,621 --> 00:14:49,287
We're friends.

416
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:51,222
Apparently.

417
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,957
Very nicely done.

418
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,660
Okay, so, think that's
H-O-R for Stanley

419
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:57,128
and H-O for Phyllis.

420
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,429
Are you calling me a ho?

421
00:14:58,431 --> 00:15:00,198
Oh, my God.

422
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,734
Phyllis coming alive.
I like it.

423
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:05,003
Question:
What about carpooling?

424
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,204
Uh, who pays for the gas?

425
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,338
We take separate cars.

426
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,806
Then question: Can sometimes
I drive your car

427
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:09,807
and you drive mine?

428
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,875
Why would we do that?

429
00:15:10,877 --> 00:15:12,310
Just for fun?
No.

430
00:15:12,312 --> 00:15:14,045
Question: Who's the primary
on the fire insurance?

431
00:15:14,047 --> 00:15:17,115
Game over!

432
00:15:17,117 --> 00:15:19,851
Offer revoked, Dwight.

433
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:21,019
I'm sorry,

434
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:23,321
but you reach out
and you try to be a nice guy

435
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,455
and help out a friend,

436
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:26,124
and this is what happens.

437
00:15:26,126 --> 00:15:27,825
This is what I get.

438
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:30,061
I... God.

439
00:15:30,063 --> 00:15:32,230
I'm... Okay.

440
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:33,431
Ooh.

441
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,999
Thank God.

442
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,634
It was nice of him to offer.

443
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:39,070
But I live in a nine-bedroom
farmhouse.

444
00:15:39,072 --> 00:15:41,239
I have my own crossbow range.

445
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,207
It's a perfect situation for me.

446
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:45,543
Although two bathrooms
would have been nice.

447
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,111
We just have the one.

448
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,415
And it's under the porch.

449
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:51,516
Ding!

450
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:52,850
Ah!
Oh!

451
00:15:52,852 --> 00:15:54,452
Who had somebody
from Van's Refrigeration?

452
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,120
Ryan Howard.

453
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,156
Ryan.

454
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,091
Gold medal.

455
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:02,493
I made something
for our closing ceremonies.

456
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:03,661
What?

457
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,129
Oh, my God!

458
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,998
Where'd you have time
to make that?

459
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,466
Automatic voice mail.

460
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,601
All right, Pam.
All right.

461
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:13,638
Nice work.

462
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,116
You know you can always
refinance your mortgage.

463
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,452
We had a 15-year
on our beet farm.

464
00:16:27,454 --> 00:16:28,586
We paid it off early.

465
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,587
Yeah, well, you know what?

466
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,656
Nobody cares
about your stupid beet farm.

467
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,658
Beets are the worst.

468
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,426
People love beets.
Nobody likes beets.

469
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,427
Everyone loves beets.

470
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,063
Nobody likes beets, Dwight!

471
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,466
Why don't you grow something
that everybody does like?

472
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:43,568
You should grow candy.

473
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,805
I'd love a piece
of candy right now.

474
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,208
Not a beet.

475
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,542
Let's get this roof goin'.

476
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,011
Stop it!
Ow!

477
00:16:53,013 --> 00:16:54,479
Final lap!
Final lap!

478
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:55,613
Oscar!

479
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:56,881
Time to beat is 1:15.

480
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:59,150
Time to beat is one minute,
15 seconds.

481
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,385
Here they come!

482
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,358
Guys?

483
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,628
What is going on?

484
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,896
Nothing.

485
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,465
Guys? Timer still goin'?
Or...

486
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,000
That's my stopwatch.

487
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:36,687
There you go.
All done.

488
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,222
Great.

489
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,025
Yeah, I filled out
the expense reports.

490
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,460
That took about five minutes.

491
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:45,530
And then I closed two sales
at lunchtime.

492
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:49,567
So... about as productive
as any other day.

493
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:52,236
If not more so.

494
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,245
I figured I could
throw it away now,

495
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,881
or I could keep it
for a couple of months

496
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,783
and then throw it away.

497
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:07,919
I mean, it was really nice
of Pam to make them,

498
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,955
but what am I gonna do
with a gold medal

499
00:18:10,957 --> 00:18:15,726
made of paper clips
and an old yogurt lid?

500
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,902
Hey.

501
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,270
I have 59 voice mails.

502
00:18:26,272 --> 00:18:27,371
Mm.

503
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:29,907
Hey, can you ignore those

504
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:32,143
and do something for me instead?

505
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,778
Sure.

506
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,946
Okay.

507
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,482
Today, 5:00...

508
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,117
closing ceremonies.

509
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,485
Really?

510
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,153
Notify the athletes.

511
00:18:42,155 --> 00:18:43,688
Cool.

512
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,258
Michael.

513
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,227
Yeah?
Jim. Slim Jim.

514
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:52,063
What's goin'... What's goin' on?

515
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:54,465
Nothin'. I just wanted to
congratulate you on your condo.

516
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,067
Oh, thanks.

517
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:57,735
Thanks. It's very cool.

518
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,837
It's, uh, three bedroom,
gay-friendly.

519
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,672
Nice.
You know.

520
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:03,541
Hey, would you mind
comin' out here for a second?

521
00:19:03,543 --> 00:19:04,842
I just have something for you.

522
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:06,144
Really?

523
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,381
What's this?

524
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,316
There are
the closing ceremonies.

525
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,651
Step up.

526
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,219
W... Um...

527
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:17,822
You're on the top one.

528
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,591
Congratulations to Michael

529
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,827
because he closed on his condo.

530
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,195
So gold medal.

531
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,571
I don't really know what to say.

532
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:34,539
Um...

533
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:38,743
I'm not one for making speeches,

534
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,145
but, uh...

535
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,915
my heart is very full
at this moment.

536
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,787
And for Dwight Schrute,
the silver medal.

537
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:52,690
Get on up here, Dwight.

538
00:19:58,864 --> 00:19:59,997
Silver medal.

539
00:19:59,999 --> 00:20:02,066
Yep.
Not as good as gold.

540
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,575
Why are you playing
the national anthem?

541
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:14,145
Um, 'cause your condo's
in America.

542
00:20:14,147 --> 00:20:16,113
Oh.

543
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:23,020
What the hell is that?

544
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:24,755
Those are the doves.

545
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,720
All right!
