1
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:08,240
So, uh, have you found
a band yet for your wedding?

2
00:00:08,242 --> 00:00:10,509
No.
'Cause I'm in a band.

3
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,344
We really rock.

4
00:00:12,346 --> 00:00:13,679
Yeah.
I mean, it's inevitable.

5
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:15,547
I definitely overhear
some wedding preparation,

6
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,982
but I'm fine with it.

7
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:20,586
She hears me arranging
my social life,

8
00:00:20,588 --> 00:00:22,488
and we both have to hear
Dwight order deer urine

9
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,789
over the Internet,

10
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,424
so it evens out.

11
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:27,426
So I got the Save The Date.
Yeah?

12
00:00:27,428 --> 00:00:28,427
Yeah, pretty stationery.

13
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:29,561
Oh, thanks.

14
00:00:29,563 --> 00:00:31,096
I didn't get mine yet.

15
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,134
Um...

16
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:38,670
There are a few people
I decided not to invite,

17
00:00:38,672 --> 00:00:42,674
and that might make things
kind of awkward, but...

18
00:00:42,676 --> 00:00:43,742
it's my wedding.

19
00:00:43,744 --> 00:00:48,747
And I don't want anyone there
who has called me a hussy.

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,614
Yes, thanks.

21
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,917
Fantastic Sam's.
Adult cut plus.

22
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,220
Comes with a shampoo
and blow-dry.

23
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:30,089
We're doing I.D. photos today.

24
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,091
Gotta represent.

25
00:01:32,093 --> 00:01:33,959
Uh, on or off?

26
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:35,027
Off.

27
00:01:35,029 --> 00:01:36,261
Okay.

28
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:39,031
Oh! What is on your face?

29
00:01:39,033 --> 00:01:40,599
Is that a disguise?

30
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,601
Excuse me.

31
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,737
Clown paint.

32
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,339
I.D. badges are long overdue.

33
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,708
Security in this office park
is a joke.

34
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:53,412
Last year I came to work with
my spud gun in a duffel bag.

35
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:56,849
I sat at my desk all day with
a rifle that shoots potatoes

36
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:59,218
at 60 pounds per square inch.

37
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,221
Can you imagine
if I was deranged?

38
00:02:02,223 --> 00:02:03,922
That's a nice tie.

39
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,827
Thank you.
That is...

40
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,662
Who makes that?
Um, I don't know.

41
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:12,564
Do you mind if I wear that
for the photo?

42
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:14,700
Uh, let's, um...

43
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:17,035
Let's keep our clothes.

44
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,770
It's like child abuse!

45
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,108
I say if Jesus saw that,
he'd freak out!

46
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,744
He'd freak out, Toby,
I mean, on so many levels.

47
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,913
And I'm supposed to work there!
I'm supposed...

48
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:29,615
What's the dealio?

49
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:31,550
Just letting Oscar
vent a little.

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,751
We would use the break room,

51
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,086
but the photographer's
back there.

52
00:02:34,088 --> 00:02:35,220
What's the problem?

53
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:36,288
Angela.

54
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:37,322
There's just a little dispute

55
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:39,825
over a poster
in their workspace.

56
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,326
Since Christmas.

57
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,061
So what, you're having
a little spat?

58
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,163
I forget.
Are you guys dating?

59
00:02:44,165 --> 00:02:45,564
No.

60
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,834
Michael, can I talk to you
for a second, please? Yes.

61
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,369
Here's how
I usually handle this.

62
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:51,703
All I do is listen.

63
00:02:51,705 --> 00:02:54,039
These things just have a way
of working themselves out.

64
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:56,341
It's like if you
write someone a letter

65
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,543
when you're really angry.

66
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,411
They say to keep it in
your drawer for a couple days,

67
00:02:59,413 --> 00:03:01,547
and then you just never
end up sending it.

68
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,649
What do you know about
conflict resolution?

69
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,451
Your answer to everything
is to get divorced, so...

70
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:07,819
Okay.
Okay, what?

71
00:03:07,821 --> 00:03:09,688
That was a right decision
for me and my marriage.

72
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,191
Well, that's not gonna fly here
because in this office,

73
00:03:12,193 --> 00:03:13,926
it is till death do us part,

74
00:03:13,928 --> 00:03:15,928
assuming that we don't
get downsized.

75
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,597
Uh, Pam, would you get Angela

76
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:21,266
and meet us in
the conference room, please?

77
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:24,469
A Mediator's Toolchest.

78
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,907
Okay, well,
before we get started,

79
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,475
you should know that there are

80
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,579
five different styles
of conflict.

81
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:37,649
My Shaolin Temple style
defeats your Monkey style.

82
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,484
Can we go?
I have a lot of work to do.

83
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:40,752
No. This is important.

84
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,188
Okay, the first style is
"lose-lose."

85
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:46,758
What's the next one?
Just hold on, please.

86
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,228
Okay, if we do lose-lose,

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,231
neither of you
gets what you want.

88
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,365
Do you understand?

89
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:58,237
You would both lose.

90
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,705
Now, I need to ask you,

91
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:04,243
do you want to pursue
a lose-lose negotiation?

92
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:07,179
Can we just skip
to whatever number five is?

93
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,447
Win-win or whatever?

94
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:11,016
Win-win is number four,

95
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,752
and number five is
win-win-win.

96
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,621
The important difference here is

97
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,756
with win-win-win,
we all win.

98
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,393
Me too. I win for having
successfully mediated

99
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:23,629
a conflict at work.

100
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,999
Okay, so this is
the disputed poster.

101
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:29,034
Now, one at a time,

102
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:31,937
I want you
to express your feelings

103
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:35,140
using "I" emotion language

104
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:38,477
and no judging,
or "you" statements.

105
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,279
I got this poster for Christmas,

106
00:04:40,281 --> 00:04:42,547
and I feel I want
to see it every day.

107
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,784
It makes me feel like the
babies are the true artists,

108
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,853
and God has a really cute
sense of humor.

109
00:04:47,855 --> 00:04:49,187
Come on, seriously.
That?

110
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,989
I don't like looking at it.

111
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:54,159
It's creepy and in bad taste,
and it's just offensive to me.

112
00:04:54,161 --> 00:04:57,262
It makes me think of the
horrible, frigid stage mothers

113
00:04:57,264 --> 00:04:58,964
who forced the babies into it.

114
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,300
It's kitsch.
It's the opposite of art.

115
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:03,602
It destroys art.
It destroys souls.

116
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,904
This is so much more offensive
to me than hard-core porno.

117
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,172
Okay, okay, okay!
Oh, my God.

118
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,740
Stop, stop, stop!

119
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,176
Let's see if we can't
just brainstorm

120
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:14,446
and find some creative
alternatives that are win-win.

121
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:16,448
Win. Yes. Thank you, Pam.

122
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,218
How about Angela makes
the poster into a t-shirt,

123
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,187
which Oscar wears.

124
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,989
That way he can never see it,

125
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,224
and whenever she looks at Oscar,

126
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:27,793
she can see it.

127
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,461
Win-win-win.

128
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:31,530
No. That's... No.

129
00:05:31,532 --> 00:05:33,031
Okay, well, brainstorm.
Own the solution.

130
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:34,766
How about I leave it up?

131
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:36,134
How about she takes it down?

132
00:05:36,136 --> 00:05:38,804
How about Angela can keep it up

133
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:41,106
on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Okay.

134
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,842
That is called a compromise,

135
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,144
and it is style three,

136
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,179
and it is not ideal.

137
00:05:47,181 --> 00:05:48,347
To sum up,

138
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,116
win-win, make the poster
into a t-shirt.

139
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:53,552
Win-lose,
take the poster down.

140
00:05:53,554 --> 00:05:55,387
Compromise,
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

141
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,589
And the answer is...

142
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,759
make the poster
into a t-shirt.

143
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,294
Win-win.
Win.

144
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:03,362
Fine.
But...

145
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:06,064
It is done!

146
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,401
No, you're all good.

147
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,469
Great.

148
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,877
Hey, Angela.
I didn't have your zip code.

149
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,380
Oh, thanks.

150
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,316
It was hand-delivered,

151
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:27,619
but I did get
a Save The Date after all.

152
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,755
It's not my taste.

153
00:06:29,757 --> 00:06:31,056
You solved it.

154
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,190
Yes.

155
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:35,394
Well, good.
We can throw that one out.

156
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:38,597
Are those all the other complaints?
Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,998
I would like to see those,
please.

158
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I... I can't do that.

159
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:45,103
You can't do that, huh?
Okay.

160
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,872
Now you and I have a conflict.

161
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:49,141
I order you
to give me that file.

162
00:06:49,143 --> 00:06:50,275
That...

163
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:52,611
Okay.

164
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,416
There!
No more conflict.

165
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,985
I had to use win-lose on that.
It was not pretty.

166
00:06:59,987 --> 00:07:01,686
All right.
Is that it?

167
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:09,828
It's all Dwight's.

168
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,563
Every Friday at 4:00,

169
00:07:11,565 --> 00:07:13,365
I have a standing appointment
with Dwight

170
00:07:13,367 --> 00:07:15,634
for him to file a grievance
against Jim.

171
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,868
I tell him that I'm sending them

172
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,804
to a special file in New York.

173
00:07:18,806 --> 00:07:20,272
That box is the...

174
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,773
Special file in New York.

175
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:24,609
Oh, God.
All right.

176
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:27,012
Why do I have to do everything?

177
00:07:27,014 --> 00:07:28,079
Are you sure?

178
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:30,749
Oh, he's sure.
Just shoot.

179
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,254
This is from Kevin.

180
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,691
He says Stanley uses his
Miracle Whip without asking.

181
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:42,828
Meredith complains that
everyone talks too loud

182
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,895
in the morning,

183
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45,997
and the lights are too bright.

184
00:07:45,999 --> 00:07:49,234
Creed...

185
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,204
Creed is sick of looking
at the redhead all day

186
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:55,340
and wants a seat facing
the receptionist.

187
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,175
Nice.

188
00:07:57,177 --> 00:08:01,379
You will notice that not one of
these complaints is against me.

189
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,981
Actually,
I have a separate folder

190
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:04,916
for complaints against Michael.

191
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:11,089
This is January through March
of this year.

192
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,661
How many of you have at one time

193
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:19,464
gone to Toby to complain
about another employee?

194
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:23,235
And did you get what you wanted,

195
00:08:23,237 --> 00:08:26,972
or were you merely listened to,
you forget about your problem,

196
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:28,006
and you move on?

197
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:31,743
That is outrageous!

198
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:33,378
I love this place,

199
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,413
and it pains me to see

200
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:39,818
all of the negativity
festering...

201
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,186
Okay.

202
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:45,557
Today we are going to get
everything out of these files

203
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:48,527
and into the open,
where it can be resolved.

204
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,696
All right, how about
the Phyllis-Angela dispute?

205
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,064
You already did me.

206
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,599
That's what she said.

207
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,734
The thing is, Angela,

208
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:58,904
you are in here an awful lot.

209
00:08:58,906 --> 00:09:00,672
You have complained
about everybody in the office,

210
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:03,275
except Dwight, which is odd

211
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,777
because everyone else has
had run-ins with Dwight.

212
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,280
Toby, by the way,
what does "redacted" mean?

213
00:09:08,282 --> 00:09:10,315
There is a file full
of complaints in here

214
00:09:10,317 --> 00:09:11,750
marked "redacted."

215
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,051
Yeah, it just means
whoever complained

216
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,286
came to me later
and withdrew it,

217
00:09:14,288 --> 00:09:16,021
so I took their name off.

218
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:17,222
Okay.

219
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,891
There were a bunch of complaints
about Dwight

220
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:22,227
that were put in the redacted
file about six months ago.

221
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,261
Wait!

222
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:25,030
If someone has
a problem with me,

223
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:27,132
why would they withdraw it
six months ago?

224
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,537
Um...
Let's move on.

225
00:09:32,539 --> 00:09:33,805
I volunteer.

226
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:35,340
Did anyone have a problem
with me?

227
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:38,176
All right, Pamela.
Come on down!

228
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:39,878
Let's do it.

229
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,181
And... okay.
Just one complaint.

230
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:45,717
Actually, it has been withdrawn.

231
00:09:45,719 --> 00:09:47,018
So that is no help to us.

232
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,853
Next.
Wait, what did it say?

233
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:51,856
Uh, "Does she have to plan
her wedding on office time?

234
00:09:51,858 --> 00:09:52,991
Shouldn't she do that
at home?"

235
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,661
Who else?

236
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:58,396
Why don't we just warm up first?

237
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,065
Warm up emotionally, all right?

238
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:02,367
I have this kind of big secret
about Angela.

239
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,902
And I've been
really nice to her,

240
00:10:03,904 --> 00:10:06,638
and I haven't told anyone,
and...

241
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,772
What the hell?!

242
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,442
Here is a Kelly complaint.

243
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,577
"Ryan never returns
my calls."

244
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,479
Ah.
Join the club.

245
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,082
My voice mail's
real spotty... sometimes.

246
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:19,884
I didn't file a complaint.
I was just talking.

247
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,386
To your HR representative.

248
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:22,921
To my friend, I thought.

249
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,389
I want that withdrawn.

250
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,091
Fine, I'll take your name off.

251
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:27,425
So no one will know.

252
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:31,029
Making progress.

253
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,364
Yes.
Dwight tried to kiss me.

254
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:33,798
What?
And I didn't tell anyone

255
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,400
'cause I'm not really sure
how I feel about it.

256
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,003
That is not true.
Redact it. Redact it!

257
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:39,571
Well, I'm not actually making
a formal complaint.

258
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,406
I just really think
we should talk about it.

259
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,607
Okay, question.

260
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,275
When a name is withdrawn,
does that also apply

261
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,512
to the permanent
misbehavior file in New York?

262
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:48,680
Sure.

263
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:51,349
Stanley.

264
00:10:51,351 --> 00:10:52,717
Hey.
A lot of anger under there...

265
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:54,452
Thanks for ratting me out.

266
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:55,487
I didn't do it.

267
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:56,755
I find that hard to believe,

268
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:58,590
considering you have problems
with every single person

269
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:02,894
in this entire office
except Bobblehead Joe.

270
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:06,364
Someone complained
that the men's room

271
00:11:06,366 --> 00:11:08,233
is "whites only."

272
00:11:08,235 --> 00:11:10,101
Stanley, you know
that's not true.

273
00:11:10,103 --> 00:11:11,936
I didn't say that.

274
00:11:11,938 --> 00:11:14,105
Then why is there a picture
of a white man on the door?

275
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:20,111
Okay, Phyllis.

276
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:22,714
You complained that Angela
is giving you dirty looks.

277
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:24,916
And you tried to get off
the party planning committee.

278
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:26,785
No, I never said any such thing.

279
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,453
Angela and I are close.

280
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:29,688
And... also, Phyllis,

281
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,691
Stanley says that you
cry too much,

282
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:33,758
and that bugs him.

283
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,427
Stanley and I are close, too.

284
00:11:35,429 --> 00:11:38,329
- We sit close.
- Okaaay.

285
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,101
Just take it.

286
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,603
I can't believe Angela.

287
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,905
I went against
my better judgment,

288
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:48,707
and I gave her a Save The Date.

289
00:11:48,709 --> 00:11:51,076
And now it turns out
she complained about me to Toby.

290
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,610
Well, it was redacted.

291
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,180
Look, if she wants an invite,

292
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,681
maybe she's just trying
to be friends.

293
00:11:56,683 --> 00:11:58,616
Don't take her side.

294
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,687
Well, what does Roy think
about everything?

295
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:05,323
I try not to bother him
about this kind of stuff.

296
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,425
You mean like your thoughts
and feelings?

297
00:12:07,427 --> 00:12:08,493
Yeah.

298
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,663
I know you keep saying
it's your space,

299
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:12,931
even though
there's no assigned parking,

300
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:13,998
but I keep forgetting.

301
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,366
Yes, that's the problem.

302
00:12:15,368 --> 00:12:16,534
I guess so.

303
00:12:17,536 --> 00:12:20,138
Okay, well.
All settled, then.

304
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,242
I don't like you.

305
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,244
Okay, Ryan, you told Toby

306
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:31,950
that Creed has a distinct
old man smell?

307
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,918
I know exactly
what he's talking about.

308
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,254
I sprout mung beans
on a damp paper towel

309
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:37,388
in my desk drawer.

310
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,957
Very nutritious.

311
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,492
But they smell like death.

312
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:41,893
All right, Kevin.

313
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:42,961
You are accused of making

314
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:45,497
sexually suggestive
remarks to Angela

315
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,232
that made her feel
uncomfortable.

316
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,733
Solution.

317
00:12:48,735 --> 00:12:50,268
Angela, you are to make

318
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,137
sexually suggestive
remarks to Kevin

319
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,171
that will make him
uncomfortable.

320
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:54,906
I accept your decision.

321
00:12:56,877 --> 00:13:00,245
Hey, you know what, Dwight? Maybe we
should get our photo I.D. taken together.

322
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,746
That doesn't make any sense.

323
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:03,214
Well, it saves time, you know.

324
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:04,349
'Cause we could just meet

325
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:05,416
in the parking lot
every morning.

326
00:13:05,418 --> 00:13:07,085
Walk in together.
Perfect.

327
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,086
Smile.

328
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:09,888
No.

329
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,389
I never smile if I can help it.

330
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:12,423
Showing one's teeth

331
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:14,459
is a submission signal
in primates.

332
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,594
When someone smiles at me,
all I see

333
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,830
is a chimpanzee
begging for its life.

334
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,002
This came out really well.

335
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:25,370
There you go.

336
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:31,376
This is humongous.

337
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:33,411
I am not a security threat.
Oh.

338
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:35,580
And my middle name is Kurt.

339
00:13:35,582 --> 00:13:37,248
Not Fart.

340
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,684
What did I write?

341
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,689
I have another complaint
for Jim's permanent file.

342
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,725
Talk to Michael.
I gave him the box.

343
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:49,093
What box?

344
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,064
But I didn't report your
snoring... Wednesdays, tearful.

345
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:56,334
Tuesdays...
Okay.

346
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,803
Ah... agh... dgh... dah! Dwight.

347
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:01,739
No, no!

348
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,174
Four years of malfeasance
unreported.

349
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,909
This cannot stand.
Okay. Calm down.

350
00:14:04,911 --> 00:14:06,444
No, you calm down.
Whose side is Toby on?

351
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:07,579
Whose side are you on?!

352
00:14:07,581 --> 00:14:09,147
Hey, hey!
Him or me?

353
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,415
Him or me?

354
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:11,783
I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Okay.

355
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:12,917
Either he goes, or I go.

356
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:14,118
Dwight, stop...
You choose!

357
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,487
One of us is out of here
by the end of today.

358
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:21,459
Okay.

359
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,596
I am not bluffing!

360
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:25,797
Okay, yes.
Okay?

361
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:26,931
Do the right thing here,
Michael.

362
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:29,400
I have served you loyally
for years.

363
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,469
I deserve this, you know I do!

364
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,375
You know your I.D. says
you're a security threat?

365
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,043
You have till 5:00.

366
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:44,883
Oh, look, Jim.

367
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:48,620
There's a sales manager
position open in Stamford.

368
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,556
Want me to call Jan
and tell her you're interested?

369
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,758
I could put in
a good word for you.

370
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,560
'Cause I'll still
be working here.

371
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,663
Trans-fer,
trans-fer... Everybody.

372
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,299
Trans-fer, trans-fer
trans-fer!

373
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:05,036
Okay, you two,
in the conference room, with me.

374
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:08,973
Nobody leaves until
we work this out.

375
00:15:08,975 --> 00:15:10,842
Cage match.

376
00:15:10,844 --> 00:15:12,477
Cage matches?
Yeah, they work.

377
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,745
How could they not work?

378
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:14,812
If they didn't work,

379
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,215
everybody would still
be in the cage.

380
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,883
Okay, so, Dwight,
in your own words.

381
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:22,053
"Someone replaced all my pens
and pencils with crayons.

382
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,355
I suspect Jim Halpert."

383
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:27,125
"Everyone has
called me Dwayne all day.

384
00:15:27,127 --> 00:15:29,460
I think Jim Halpert
paid them to."

385
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,797
Yes, five bucks each.

386
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,499
And it was totally worth it.

387
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:37,635
"This morning I found a bloody
glove in my desk drawer,

388
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:40,004
"and Jim Halpert
tried to convince me

389
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:41,239
"I committed murder.

390
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,474
I think he may be
the real murderer."

391
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,810
"Jim Halpert said there was
an abandoned infant

392
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:46,844
"in the women's room.

393
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,613
"When I went to save the child,

394
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,148
I saw Meredith on the can."

395
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:51,950
Gad.

396
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:57,588
"This morning I knocked myself
in the head with the phone."

397
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:00,692
That actually took a while.

398
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:03,461
I had to put more and more
nickels into his handset,

399
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,196
till he got used to the weight,

400
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:07,932
and then I just...
took 'em all out.

401
00:16:07,934 --> 00:16:10,401
"Every time I typed my name

402
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:12,170
it said Diapers."

403
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,840
Just a simple macro.

404
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:18,943
You know, these actually
don't sound that funny

405
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:19,978
one after another.

406
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,413
But he does deserve it, though.

407
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,948
"By the end of the day,

408
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,117
my desk was about two feet
closer to the copier."

409
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,420
Yeah, I just moved it an inch

410
00:16:29,422 --> 00:16:30,955
every time he went
to the bathroom.

411
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:34,659
And that's how I spent
my entire day that day.

412
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,953
The Japanese have this thing
called shiatsu massage,

413
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,523
where they dig into your body,
very hard.

414
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,824
And it is very painful.

415
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,926
And apparently,
some people throw up.

416
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,529
But the next day
they feel great.

417
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,598
I've never had one.

418
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,066
They sound awful.

419
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,174
Maybe Stamford would be cool.

420
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:26,978
It's a good market.

421
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:29,647
Higher volume.

422
00:17:30,249 --> 00:17:31,382
Yeah.

423
00:17:33,318 --> 00:17:34,552
Maybe we should both go.

424
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:36,854
I have a girlfriend.

425
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,890
Sure, you do, Dwight. Sure.

426
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,627
Hey, there's, like,
300 more of these.

427
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,928
Let's get to them later.

428
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,696
So, you gonna
transfer Jim or not?

429
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:47,932
Maybe. I haven't decided yet.

430
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:48,933
Let's get to work.

431
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:50,535
I want an answer by tomorrow.

432
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:54,105
Okay... ooh, actually,
tomorrow's not good.

433
00:17:54,107 --> 00:17:56,340
How about later in the week?

434
00:17:56,342 --> 00:17:57,809
Fine.

435
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:00,311
Good. Okay.

436
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,450
Hey! Wait.

437
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:08,419
How about a group picture
while you're here?

438
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:10,588
I can't. I only get reimbursed
for the I.D. photos.

439
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,557
Well, that's, what,
a computer camera, right?

440
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,125
You mean, digital?

441
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,127
Yeah, it'll take, like,
two seconds.

442
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,096
20 bucks.

443
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,697
All right.

444
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:23,034
Everybody, come on.
Group photo for the newsletter.

445
00:18:23,036 --> 00:18:24,869
You've gotta be kidding.

446
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:26,637
Come on, everybody.
Come on, let's go.

447
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:29,874
Creed, Kevin, Oscar,
andale, let's go.

448
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:32,443
One, two, three.
Smile.

449
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,978
Try to smile.

450
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,079
We resolved a lot today,
everybody.

451
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,214
Think happy thoughts.

452
00:18:36,216 --> 00:18:37,548
Okay, I'm just gonna
take it on three,

453
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,850
whether you smile or not.

454
00:18:38,852 --> 00:18:40,184
One, two, three.

455
00:18:40,186 --> 00:18:41,886
Good. Let's check that out.

456
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:44,522
Ew, okay, all right.

457
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:46,023
One more.
We'll take one more.

458
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,191
That'll be another 20.

459
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,593
What?

460
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:51,095
Angela, I want to talk to
you about something. What?

461
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,196
No, Pam...
I am.

462
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:53,698
It's about the Save The Date...

463
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,999
Pam, it wasn't her.
What?

464
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,369
I'm the one
who complained about you.

465
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:04,008
I didn't know that Toby
was gonna write it down.

466
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,410
I was just venting.

467
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,479
You know, it was one day.

468
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:09,981
And I took it right back.

469
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,616
It was like...

470
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:14,819
Okay.

471
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,354
Oh, dear.

472
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:22,026
Okay... we can do this.

473
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,327
Come on, everybody.

474
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:26,931
All right.

475
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:28,599
Here we go.

476
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,403
It was really hard getting
a good picture of 15 people.

477
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:34,172
He would not give me a discount.

478
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:36,140
And eight tries added up.

479
00:19:36,142 --> 00:19:38,576
One, two...

480
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,311
Didn't say three, did I?

481
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:43,114
But I'm sort of an expert
at Photoshop.

482
00:19:43,116 --> 00:19:45,149
So it turned out fine
in the end.

483
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,517
When people work together,

484
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,319
there is going to be conflict.

485
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:50,588
You can't outrun your problems.

486
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,356
Hey, Pam, it's Jim.

487
00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:54,592
Um, I have a doctor's
appointment in the city.

488
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,128
So I probably won't be in
till the late afternoon.

489
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,931
Just thought I'd let ya know.
Okay, bye.

490
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,933
Okay, Jan will see you now.

491
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,267
Oh, thanks.

492
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:06,037
And that is why the idea
of a cage match

493
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,773
is so universally appealing.

494
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:11,175
But here's the thing
about cage matches.

495
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,745
Sometimes you have
to open the cage.

496
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:20,318
And that is something that Toby
will never understand.
