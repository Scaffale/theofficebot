1
00:00:01,868 --> 00:00:03,635
I really like Valentine's Day

2
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:04,770
in this office.

3
00:00:04,772 --> 00:00:06,372
It's kind of like grade school.

4
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:09,108
Everybody gives out
little presents and stuff.

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,576
Like last year,

6
00:00:10,578 --> 00:00:12,978
Jim gave me this card
with Dwight's head on it.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:16,181
It was horrifying and funny.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,923
Phyllis.

9
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:27,359
You could just sign here.

10
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,228
Roy and I are saving
for the wedding,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,631
so I made him promise not
to get me anything too big.

12
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:34,133
Happy Valentine's Day, Darling,

13
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,369
love Bob Vance,
Vance Refrigeration.

14
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,305
Isn't he sweet?
Yeah. Wow.

15
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:41,473
All right, Dwight.

16
00:00:41,475 --> 00:00:43,475
As you know, I'm heading
to New York today

17
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,077
doing a presentation
on the branch

18
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:46,412
to the new CFO.

19
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:48,914
And you want me to come with you.
No.

20
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:50,115
Opposite of that.

21
00:00:50,117 --> 00:00:52,284
I will stay here
and run things on this end.

22
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:53,519
Very good.

23
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,789
Will you be seeing Jan
when you're in New York?

24
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:58,724
I probably will.
Why do you ask?

25
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,060
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

26
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:03,162
And you guys, you know...

27
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:04,363
Yeah.

28
00:01:04,365 --> 00:01:05,864
Screwed.

29
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,733
What is your problem?

30
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,334
This is a business trip.

31
00:01:09,336 --> 00:01:11,303
I would have to be
a raving lunatic

32
00:01:11,305 --> 00:01:12,905
to try to talk to Jan

33
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:14,406
about what happened between us.

34
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:16,008
Her words, not mine.

35
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,843
She sent me an e-mail
this morning.

36
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,282
But it is Valentine's Day.

37
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:26,485
It's New York, city of love.

38
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,788
Hey, Pam, you heart NY, right?

39
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,457
You want me
to pick you up anything?

40
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,458
That's okay.

41
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:33,559
All right.

42
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:34,760
The best present would be

43
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,795
you do a good job
in front of the new CFO.

44
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,931
Dude, I'm going to nail it.

45
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:41,066
Me in New York?
Oh, I own that city.

46
00:01:41,068 --> 00:01:43,202
Fo'get abou' it!

47
00:01:43,204 --> 00:01:44,837
See ya!

48
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,239
Well, here we go
on our way to New York.

49
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,573
New York, New York.

50
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,076
The city so nice,
they named it twice.

51
00:02:24,078 --> 00:02:26,778
Manhattan is the other name.

52
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,448
So I broke up with Katy

53
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,782
and haven't been dating
anybody else.

54
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,184
So this year,

55
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,186
I don't have to worry
about Valentine's Day.

56
00:02:34,188 --> 00:02:35,187
It's gonna be good.

57
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,455
I invited a couple friends over.

58
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,689
We're gonna play some cards.

59
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,391
And I'll end up winning
a lot of money

60
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,527
because they're idiots.

61
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:43,295
It's gonna be great.

62
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,799
What's this?
What is this?

63
00:02:47,801 --> 00:02:50,536
I don't know.
It's on your desk.

64
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,770
Yeah, but who put it here

65
00:02:51,772 --> 00:02:53,105
and for what purpose?

66
00:02:53,107 --> 00:02:54,806
It was there when I sat down.

67
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:06,351
Happy Valentine's Day.

68
00:03:14,827 --> 00:03:15,961
It's me.

69
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,664
I'm the bobble-head.

70
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:23,802
Yes!

71
00:03:23,804 --> 00:03:26,738
Ah!

72
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,607
Yeah.

73
00:03:28,609 --> 00:03:29,608
The meeting
isn't till 3:00.

74
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,909
But I always like to come
to New York

75
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:32,044
a little bit early

76
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,545
and hit some
of my favorite haunts.

77
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,814
Like right here is my favorite
New York pizza joint.

78
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:39,818
And I'm gonna go get me
a New York slice.

79
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:45,357
Hey, Kelly. What's up?

80
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:48,393
Nothing. Oh.
Except, oh my God, Jim.

81
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:51,964
Last night, Ryan and I
totally finally hooked up.

82
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,365
It was awesome.

83
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,967
Oh, that's great.
I'm really happy for you.

84
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,368
I know.
And it was so funny.

85
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,170
'Cause we were at this bar
with his friends.

86
00:03:58,172 --> 00:04:00,239
And I was sitting
next to him the whole night.

87
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:01,406
And he wasn't making a move.

88
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,008
So in my head, I was like, Ryan,

89
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,076
what's taking you so long?

90
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,110
And then he kissed me.

91
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,511
And I didn't know what to say.

92
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:09,781
So I said, "Ryan,
what took you so long?"

93
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,483
I mean, I just said it to him.
Can you believe that?

94
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:12,517
Wow.

95
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:14,353
Oh my God, Jim.
Is that embarrassing?

96
00:04:14,355 --> 00:04:15,487
I'm embarrassed.

97
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,521
No, don't be.

98
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,756
Oh, thank God.

99
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,124
Because I was nervous, Jim.

100
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,259
You will not believe.

101
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,293
I bet.

102
00:04:21,295 --> 00:04:22,427
I was so nervous.

103
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,931
But now... now I have
a boyfriend.

104
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:29,201
I hooked up with her
on February 13th.

105
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,372
Here it is.
Heart of New York City.

106
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:34,840
Times Square.

107
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:37,142
Named for the good times
you have

108
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,845
when you're in it.

109
00:04:39,847 --> 00:04:41,580
Most people when they come
to New York,

110
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,415
they go straight
to the Empire State Building.

111
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,251
That's very touristy.
I come here.

112
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,619
Great places to eat.

113
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,289
We have Bubba Gump Shrimp,
Red Lobster down there.

114
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,124
You know.

115
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:56,194
This is... this is the heart
of civilization right here.

116
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,031
Whoa.

117
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,269
Oh.

118
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,404
Guess what?

119
00:05:05,406 --> 00:05:07,239
Really?
Mm-hmm.

120
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:11,209
They're from Bob again.
That's great.

121
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:17,149
Everybody takes the subway
in New York.

122
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:21,119
It's fast, it's efficient,
gets you there on time.

123
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,187
It's a way to...

124
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:23,588
Okay, there's a guy pooping

125
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,258
in a cardboard box down there.

126
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,927
This is the world-famous
Rockefeller Center.

127
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:30,729
Founded, of course,
by Theodore Rockefeller.

128
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,497
This is the skating rink.

129
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:36,501
And I think the Rangers
practice there sometimes.

130
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,671
And it's... that's Tina Fey.

131
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,374
That's Tina Fey
from Saturday Night Live.

132
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:45,143
Hello. Hello.

133
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,646
Hi. Oh, I'm s...
I'm sorry.

134
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:51,116
I thought you were...
Okay.

135
00:05:51,118 --> 00:05:55,053
She looked like... she looked
a lot like Tina Fey.

136
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,388
Hello. Hello.

137
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:59,558
I thought that was Tina Fey,
but it wasn't.

138
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,959
Are you serious?

139
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,494
He was here?

140
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:04,663
When? When I was talking
to the fake Tina Fey?

141
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:06,465
Come on! No, s...

142
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,571
Hello, Angela.
Did you her?

143
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:14,106
Somebody totally
rocked the house

144
00:06:14,108 --> 00:06:16,007
and got me the best present
I've ever gotten.

145
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,543
Really? I wouldn't know
anything about that.

146
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,345
But I'm glad you enjoyed it.

147
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,381
Oh, I did. I did.

148
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:24,349
I didn't get anything
for Valentine's Day.

149
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,351
Oh, I bet you will
before the day is over.

150
00:06:26,353 --> 00:06:29,788
Really?
Well, I hope I do.

151
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,431
I would love to live
in New York some day.

152
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:41,266
It's a big dream of mine.

153
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,868
Work corporate with Jan.

154
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,069
Be awesome.

155
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:46,872
Go to Broadway shows,
eat hotdogs.

156
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,073
Scranton is great,

157
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:52,444
but New York is like
Scranton on acid.

158
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,312
No, on speed.
Nah.

159
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,182
On steroids.

160
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:00,285
Okay. Um, I think...

161
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:03,355
that's either the Hudson
or the East.

162
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,024
So we're back... should be
back this way.

163
00:07:08,027 --> 00:07:10,829
There is a lot of pressure
on me right now.

164
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:13,665
It's like Michael Jordan
in the NBA finals

165
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:16,668
or like Stormin'
Norman Schwarzkopf.

166
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,204
And this presentation
is Desert Storm.

167
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,173
And as soon as it's over,

168
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:24,109
we will not have to deal
with those Iraqis anymore.

169
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,610
Let's do it.

170
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:30,282
No, that's all right. Spend money
on her instead of giving it to us.

171
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:31,349
That's fine.

172
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,786
No, I didn't even have
a seat for you anyway.

173
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,854
Yeah.

174
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:37,756
All right, man.

175
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:40,625
Okay, have a good night.
Bye.

176
00:07:48,502 --> 00:07:50,302
Whoa, whoa.

177
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,204
Phyllis Lapin?

178
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,939
Holy God.
It's from Bob.

179
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:56,274
Man, that thing's
bigger than I am.

180
00:07:56,276 --> 00:07:58,710
No, it's not.
Oh, zip it.

181
00:07:58,712 --> 00:07:59,811
There they are.

182
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,812
What's up?

183
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:01,880
Hey.
Hey hey.

184
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:02,981
Michael Scott.
Josh Porter.

185
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,650
Hi five.

186
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:07,118
Bam.

187
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,587
You know Dan Gordon
from Buffalo.

188
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,855
Yeah, how you doing?

189
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,189
Nobody needs
to introduce this guy.

190
00:08:11,191 --> 00:08:12,324
Craigers.

191
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,758
Oh.
What's up, buddy?

192
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,061
You have been kicked out
of every strip club in Albany,

193
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:17,462
is that true?
Guilty. Yeah.

194
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,331
So what's going on?
What'd I miss?

195
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,633
Not much. They're, uh,
I guess running late upstairs.

196
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:24,269
So we're just waiting
for the presentations.

197
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:25,937
Cool. Good. Good.
Good.

198
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:28,540
Give us some time
to catch up and...

199
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:34,779
Pam, hi.
How you doing? Good.

200
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,781
Listen, uh,
may I speak with you...

201
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:38,950
privately?

202
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,252
You can't fire me, Dwight,

203
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:41,520
just 'cause Michael's not here.

204
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:43,488
No, Pam, just, um...

205
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:45,757
Just...

206
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,528
You need to get something
for your girlfriend?

207
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,896
Girlfriend. Yes.

208
00:08:50,898 --> 00:08:52,597
And the reason I didn't
get anything

209
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,766
for this particular person...
who shall remain nameless...

210
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:57,469
is that she's not really
the kind of person

211
00:08:57,471 --> 00:08:59,838
you'd think would be
in to Valentine's Day.

212
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,406
She's kind of...

213
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,441
Tightly wound?

214
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,545
Exactly.

215
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,380
Okay.

216
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:11,216
Well, sometimes the gift
is really about the gesture,

217
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,851
you know, like what it means

218
00:09:12,853 --> 00:09:13,919
instead of what it is.

219
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:17,422
You mean like a ham?

220
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,257
No.

221
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,825
Not like a ham.

222
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,696
It's about doing something
so that the person knows

223
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,498
that you really care about her.

224
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,700
That you remember her. Okay, I get it.
That's great.

225
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:30,101
Okay, shut up.
I know exactly what to do.

226
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,373
How about you, Craig?

227
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,675
Did you lose anyone?

228
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,343
Oh man. Jan called me
in September.

229
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:40,278
And she's like you gotta
fire four people.

230
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,080
And I was just like, what?
You know.

231
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,216
Did you?

232
00:09:45,218 --> 00:09:46,751
No. I just ignored her.

233
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,320
She's the worst.

234
00:09:48,322 --> 00:09:49,821
She is our boss.

235
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,089
She ain't my boss, dude.

236
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,424
I don't work for that bitch.

237
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,792
Hey, ca... ca... come on.

238
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,427
You know, that's not...
Just cool it.

239
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:57,562
You like Jan?
How can you like Jan?

240
00:09:57,564 --> 00:09:59,464
Maybe because she's
my girlfriend.

241
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:05,003
Was or not my girlfriend.

242
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,404
We hooked up and...

243
00:10:06,406 --> 00:10:07,772
You hooked up with Jan?

244
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,374
That was just,
you know, months ago.

245
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,142
It was just once.

246
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,510
God, it's just stupid.

247
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:14,079
Just forget it.

248
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:15,614
Yeah, let's change the subject.

249
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,948
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:21,286
I don't know what he's thinking,

251
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,887
but I would just be so psyched

252
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,989
if we just dated forever.

253
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,291
Well, take it slow.

254
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,159
'Cause it seems like
a lot of the time,

255
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,195
things like that need to...

256
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:34,733
Soda.

257
00:10:34,735 --> 00:10:36,368
Cool.

258
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:42,774
Hey, so do you want
to do something tonight?

259
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,077
Oh, no, not while I'm here.

260
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,513
I mean, I know that it's
Valentine's Day or whatever,

261
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,215
but there's totally
no pressure at all

262
00:10:50,217 --> 00:10:52,017
of any kind whatsoever.

263
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:54,753
I can't tonight.
I have plans with my friends.

264
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:56,921
Okay. That's cool.

265
00:10:56,923 --> 00:11:00,225
I completely understand.
Okay. Cool.

266
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:01,559
Okay.

267
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,482
Josh Porter, Stanford.

268
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,718
And Michael Scott, Scranton.

269
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,053
Nice to meet you.
Ditto.

270
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,154
How are you, Jan?

271
00:11:29,156 --> 00:11:30,955
Fine, Michael. Thank you.

272
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,858
Okay. So we are
in the process

273
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,193
of doing a complete review

274
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,195
of the company's
financial strength.

275
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:38,563
All I'd like to do today...

276
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,998
Nervous?
No, I'm not nervous.

277
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,733
Well, I mean,
I guess I'd be lying

278
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:43,568
if I didn't say
I was a little nervous.

279
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,603
Um, the new CFO
is judging me on this too.

280
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,805
And, well, it is Michael.

281
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:51,009
So, yeah, I'm very nervous.

282
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,044
So with the 12
new local accounts,

283
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,047
we had a total
of 4% organic growth,

284
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,717
which was just above
our pre-year targets.

285
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:00,218
Thanks very much.
Thank you.

286
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,454
Okay, Michael.

287
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,395
What is a business?

288
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:14,799
Is it a collection of numbers
and sales reports?

289
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,134
Sure.

290
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:17,569
But as you know,

291
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:19,170
David and Jan,

292
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:21,206
it is much more.

293
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:42,894
Life moves a little slower
in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

294
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:45,430
And that's the way we like it.

295
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,432
'Cause at Dunder Mifflin,
Scranton,

296
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,635
we're not just
in the paper business,

297
00:12:50,637 --> 00:12:52,904
we're in the people business.

298
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,839
Let's meet some of the folks

299
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:58,943
who make the Scranton
branch so special.

300
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,945
This is Stanley Hudson,

301
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,947
one of our talented salesmen.

302
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:05,917
An African-American
father of two,

303
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,519
Stanley's dedication

304
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:09,287
is no doubt one of the hallmarks

305
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,089
of the foundation
of the business

306
00:13:11,091 --> 00:13:13,124
we're hoping to build
our basis on.

307
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,928
Yeah, I shot a bunch
of footage around the office,

308
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,930
edited it together on my Mac.

309
00:13:18,932 --> 00:13:21,266
Was thinking about
entering it in some festivals.

310
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,400
Probably won't.

311
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:24,435
You know, not what this
is about.

312
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:28,006
And finally, Pam Beesly.

313
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,307
Look at her.

314
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,608
Look how cute.

315
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,077
Not bad at all.

316
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:34,679
As the receptionist,

317
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:38,983
Pam is truly the gateway
to our world.

318
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:42,020
Well, I hope this gave you
a little taste

319
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:45,390
of what life is like here
at Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.

320
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,726
What it's like to walk
a mile in Oscar's shoes.

321
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:51,429
Or try on Phyllis' pants.

322
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:53,665
Next time you're in town,
give us a call.

323
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,600
Stop on by.

324
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:57,836
I'm sure you'll be greeted
by a big smile

325
00:13:57,838 --> 00:13:59,537
and a "How you doing, pal?"

326
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:02,140
Maybe even one of Angela's
famous brownies.

327
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,777
And you'll know
that you're home.

328
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:16,754
Great Scott!

329
00:14:18,591 --> 00:14:19,657
Questions.

330
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:23,261
Wow.

331
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,898
Okay. Okay,
thank you, Michael.

332
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,666
That was great.
Yes, thank you.

333
00:14:28,668 --> 00:14:29,667
But for right now,

334
00:14:29,669 --> 00:14:31,369
what I'd really like
to know about

335
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,404
is the branch's performance.

336
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,773
So do you have
that information as well?

337
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,710
Yes, absolutely, David.

338
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:41,179
Get that for you.

339
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:48,386
Can you sign?

340
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,454
Yeah.

341
00:14:50,122 --> 00:14:51,189
Oscar.

342
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:52,924
Nothing for me?

343
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,158
Join the club.

344
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,696
Who's it from?

345
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,431
My mom.

346
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,578
It's frustrating 'cause we'd be

347
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,313
so perfect together.

348
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:18,116
You know what?
Here's the deal, Kelly.

349
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:20,818
It would be really nice
if he was into you, right?

350
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,820
It would be great.

351
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:23,888
But he isn't.

352
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:25,957
Yeah, but it would be
so great if he was.

353
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:27,292
Well, he's not though.

354
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,927
So you just gotta suck it up.

355
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,195
You just gotta move on.
Try to have some fun.

356
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:33,464
Come to my poker game tonight.

357
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,099
Okay, cool.

358
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,702
Is it okay if I invite Ryan?

359
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:46,878
And that about does it.
Thank you.

360
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,181
Okay. Craig.

361
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,450
Yeah. Here's the deal.

362
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,787
I did not understand
this was supposed to be

363
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:59,290
a full on like report
or whatnot.

364
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,658
I'm sorry.

365
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,795
What did you think
"financial presentation" meant?

366
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,363
I was under the impression

367
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:08,599
this was more of like
a meet-and-greet type deal.

368
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,102
So does that mean
that you don't have

369
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:12,804
the numbers on your branch?

370
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,305
That is correct. Yes.

371
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,641
Craig, you realize

372
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,509
that we are trying to decide
whether drastic steps

373
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,811
need to be taken.

374
00:16:19,813 --> 00:16:21,479
Look, I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

375
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,381
Well, the point is
that this doesn't exactly

376
00:16:23,383 --> 00:16:24,882
bode well for your branch.

377
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,117
Oh, man.

378
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:28,119
You know what?
Michael made that stupid movie.

379
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,654
He doesn't get in any trouble.

380
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,756
Maybe I should've slept
with you too.

381
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,163
Okay. Okay.
All right.

382
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,832
No, no, no, I'm not...
I just...

383
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:44,168
I just don't know
what to do anymore, Michael.

384
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,237
I mean, I'm probably
going to get fired.

385
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:48,006
No, you're not.

386
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,074
Michael, the CFO thinks
that we slept together.

387
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:53,077
Don't you understand?
People get fired for much less.

388
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:54,879
And I just can't believe

389
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,147
that you told everybody.

390
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:59,217
And we didn't even
sleep together.

391
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,953
Technically,
we fell asleep in the same bed.

392
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:03,154
Oh, God.

393
00:17:03,156 --> 00:17:06,391
Michael, it was months ago.
It was once.

394
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:09,160
It's over.

395
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,295
Do you understand?

396
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:14,032
Yes.

397
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:17,568
I'm sorry.

398
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,338
I'll fix this.
I'll talk to him.

399
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,406
I'll talk to David.

400
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:24,809
Surely, you cannot be serious.

401
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,578
I am serious,
and don't call me Shirley.

402
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,813
Airplane.

403
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:39,991
Women are like wolves.

404
00:17:39,993 --> 00:17:42,827
If you want a wolf,
you have to trap it.

405
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,796
You have to snare it.

406
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,199
And then you have to tame it.

407
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:50,134
Keep it happy.
Care for it. Feed it.

408
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:53,571
Lovingly the way an animal
deserves to be loved.

409
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:58,943
And my animal deserves
a lot of loving.

410
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,781
Hey, babe.

411
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,750
You, uh, almost ready to go?

412
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:07,718
I guess, yeah.

413
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,220
What's wrong?

414
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:10,354
Nothing.

415
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,356
It's just that I had
to sit here all day

416
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:13,724
while Phyllis got
like an entire garden

417
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,826
delivered to her.

418
00:18:14,828 --> 00:18:16,294
What, you're mad at me?

419
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:19,263
I mean, I know
that we said no big gifts,

420
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,432
but I was kind of hoping
you'd get me something

421
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,767
for Valentine's Day.

422
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,936
Well, Valentine's Day
isn't over.

423
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:26,471
Let's get you home,

424
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:29,107
and you are gonna get
the best sex of your life.

425
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,545
You understand this is
a very serious situation.

426
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,314
No, no, no.
Yes, I... Okay, well...

427
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:37,482
All right, here's the deal.

428
00:18:37,484 --> 00:18:39,550
This is my fault.
This is totally on me.

429
00:18:39,552 --> 00:18:40,885
Before you guys came in,

430
00:18:40,887 --> 00:18:43,054
I was talking to the guys,
we were all chatting.

431
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:45,356
And I made a joke.

432
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,691
A really dumb joke.

433
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:48,593
And Craig the idiot
took it seriously.

434
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:50,561
You made a joke?
I did.

435
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:51,729
It was stupid.

436
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:53,197
And Craig, you saw him,

437
00:18:53,199 --> 00:18:55,700
he's not the sharpest tool
in the shed.

438
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,902
Although he is a tool.

439
00:18:57,904 --> 00:18:59,737
Well, I don't need
to explain to you

440
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,472
that even a joke
about sexual relations

441
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,174
with your boss...

442
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,842
I know.
It was borderline at best.

443
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:08,880
And... and Jan
is a fantastic executive

444
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:10,848
and has all the integrity
in the world.

445
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,352
And, um, I'm really sorry.

446
00:19:14,354 --> 00:19:17,288
It'll never happen again.

447
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,825
Uh, it's fine.

448
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:23,361
Let's just, uh, just forget it.

449
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:25,696
Good.

450
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,408
Heading out?

451
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,743
Yeah.

452
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:40,378
All right, Beesly.

453
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,747
Hey, happy Valentine's Day.

454
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,082
Bye.

455
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,655
Good night, Pam.

456
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,523
Night, Phyllis.

457
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,262
Uh, Michael.

458
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,298
Thank you again
for that, really.

459
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,499
It was very nice.

460
00:20:01,501 --> 00:20:03,701
Oh, no big deal.
Really. Sorry again.

461
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,038
Oh, no.
It's... it's okay.

462
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,540
So, uh, happy Valentine's Day.

463
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,009
Yeah, happy Valentine's Day.

464
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:26,390
Oh.

465
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,931
Oi vey... schmear.
