1
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:06,335
Got you! Broken arm.
Boom! Boom! Boom!

2
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:10,398
Broken nose! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Broken nose! Gonna flip you.

3
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:12,705
Once a year, Dwight holds
a seminar updating us

4
00:00:12,778 --> 00:00:15,246
on the newest developments
in the world of karate.

5
00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:16,837
<i>Because,
as we all know,</i>

6
00:00:16,915 --> 00:00:19,679
the one thing that thousand-year-old
martial arts do all the time

7
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:21,013
is change.

8
00:00:21,186 --> 00:00:25,145
How can I pose this to
you in a relatable way?

9
00:00:25,223 --> 00:00:28,056
You are all members
of the Yakuza,

10
00:00:28,126 --> 00:00:31,095
and you happen to be visiting
the Lackawanna Trolley Museum,

11
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,757
and you are attacked
by Triads.

12
00:00:33,832 --> 00:00:37,461
How can you hold them off
until your clan arrives?

13
00:00:37,536 --> 00:00:40,266
You cannot go wrong
with a throat punch.

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,070
Okay, so there's no defense
for that. Good to know.

15
00:00:44,142 --> 00:00:46,975
No, there is a defense for
that. Let me demonstrate.

16
00:00:47,045 --> 00:00:48,637
Someone attack me.
Kevin, go!

17
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:50,010
No way.

18
00:00:50,081 --> 00:00:52,208
Last time, you pulled
my pants down,

19
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,650
and then you tried to
choke me with my shoelace.

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,450
False. I did choke you with
your shoelace. Now come at me!

21
00:00:58,523 --> 00:01:00,184
Okay, with all due respect
to everyone here,

22
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:03,921
I think the most worthy
opponent of you is you.

23
00:01:03,995 --> 00:01:07,089
That is correct, unless there
happen to be measles present.

24
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,760
So let's just say that Dwight has
come at you with the throat punch.

25
00:01:10,836 --> 00:01:13,202
Now, how would you, Dwight,
defend against it?

26
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:15,262
Easy. Allow me
to demonstrate.

27
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,776
I am attacking myself with a
throat punch. Here it comes.

28
00:01:18,844 --> 00:01:21,972
Block. Grasp wrist as such.

29
00:01:22,047 --> 00:01:23,139
And what if he comes at
you with the other hand?

30
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:24,546
Because he does have two.

31
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:28,583
Good point. Second throat
punch. Absorb the blow.

32
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,850
Groin punch. Hit,
block, elbow to the gut!

33
00:01:32,924 --> 00:01:35,188
Uh-oh! Up to the nose!
No, you're not!

34
00:01:37,195 --> 00:01:40,164
Oh, my God, he's making
you look like such a fool.

35
00:01:40,232 --> 00:01:42,723
He really is,
but not for long.

36
00:01:43,768 --> 00:01:47,602
Ow! God! Instep!
Not again!

37
00:01:49,174 --> 00:01:52,405
You let go! You let go! I can't hold on!

38
00:01:53,378 --> 00:01:54,572
You two are so
evenly matched,

39
00:01:54,646 --> 00:01:56,739
I don't know how one of you
is gonna get the upper hand.

40
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,544
The important thing
to remember, Jim,

41
00:01:58,617 --> 00:02:02,781
we always have what is called
the element of surprise.

42
00:02:27,345 --> 00:02:29,336
But I would say
my favorite art form

43
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:31,678
is a tie between sculpting
and stand-up comedy.

44
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,876
I did stand-up comedy once.

45
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,316
You did?
Yeah, I killed.

46
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,614
That sounds like
it was hilarious.

47
00:02:35,687 --> 00:02:36,813
It was hilarious.

48
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:37,877
Michael?
Yes?

49
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,947
What is the meaning of this
e-mail that everyone got?

50
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:41,515
You'll have to be
more specific, Dwight.

51
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,652
I get like
eight e-mails a day.

52
00:02:43,728 --> 00:02:46,720
This one. "From David Wallace
to all Dunder Mifflin."

53
00:02:46,798 --> 00:02:48,163
Whoo-hoo! Shout-out.

54
00:02:48,233 --> 00:02:50,292
<i>"Hello, everyone. I'm sure you've
seen the item in the Journal.</i>

55
00:02:50,368 --> 00:02:52,393
"Just want to stress,
it's all conjecture.

56
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:55,735
"If there's any concrete
news, you will know ASAP."

57
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:56,796
<i>Erin, do we have
the Journal?</i>

58
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:57,864
Your "feelings journal"?

59
00:02:57,943 --> 00:02:59,103
You told me to put it
in the time capsule.

60
00:02:59,177 --> 00:03:00,804
Did you?
Michael,

61
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,847
<i>he means The Wall Street
Journal online.</i>

62
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:04,108
Oh, "The wall."

63
00:03:04,182 --> 00:03:05,547
I found the article.

64
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,353
"On a day marked by panicked
corporate board meetings,

65
00:03:10,422 --> 00:03:12,549
"one that is relatively
unsurprising is Dunder Mifflin's.

66
00:03:12,624 --> 00:03:15,024
"It is rumored that
they will recommend..."

67
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:16,924
And the article cuts off.

68
00:03:16,995 --> 00:03:19,020
It's $1.99 to
finish the article.

69
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:22,260
I wonder what
it was gonna say.

70
00:03:22,334 --> 00:03:23,926
Are you serious?

71
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:28,836
I got it, I got it. Oh!
Tuna beat me to it.

72
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:32,570
"It is rumored that they will
recommend declaring bankruptcy?"

73
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:34,771
No, no. That doesn't
make any sense.

74
00:03:34,846 --> 00:03:36,939
Oh, Lord, we're all
gonna lose our jobs.

75
00:03:37,015 --> 00:03:39,108
Not necessarily. Bankruptcy
could mean a lot of things.

76
00:03:39,184 --> 00:03:40,742
Maybe they're just
restructuring to get out of debt.

77
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:42,514
Right.
Oh, that sounds awful.

78
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:44,350
Or it could mean
the end of Dunder Mifflin.

79
00:03:44,422 --> 00:03:47,482
Oh, God! Well, that's
an interesting theory.

80
00:03:47,559 --> 00:03:48,651
You know what?

81
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:52,322
You can all have jobs at Schrute
Farms as human scarecrows.

82
00:03:52,397 --> 00:03:54,456
It doesn't pay much
and you can't unionize.

83
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>I'm sorry,
Michael. David's in a meeting.</i>

84
00:03:56,434 --> 00:03:58,629
Ah, well, maybe you
should spy on him.

85
00:04:00,872 --> 00:04:03,602
Oh, my God!
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

86
00:04:05,477 --> 00:04:07,411
<i>I'll just have him call
you back when he's free.</i>

87
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,639
Okay, okay. Good.

88
00:04:08,713 --> 00:04:11,876
I'll catch you on
the flippity-flip. Bye!

89
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,918
He's busy.
Call me back when he's free.

90
00:04:20,825 --> 00:04:23,555
Michael, are you okay?
Did you throw up in there?

91
00:04:23,628 --> 00:04:26,222
No, just pooping.
You know how I be.

92
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:28,128
But it smells like
throw-up in here.

93
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:29,996
Crazy world,
lot of smells.

94
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,663
You guys, what if this
is our last day at work?

95
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:35,638
What if we never see
each other ever again?

96
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,873
I like Erin.
There, I said it.

97
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,740
I was kind of hoping
she would ask me out,

98
00:04:46,818 --> 00:04:50,117
but things have not
panned out on that front,

99
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,080
so, it's time
for the Nard-Dog

100
00:04:53,158 --> 00:04:56,093
to take matters
into his own paws.

101
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:15,504
<i>Everything is gonna</i>

102
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,238
We have to do something, because
people are losing it out there,

103
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,113
wondering what's
gonna happen.

104
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,120
Okay, we need some sort of
distraction for everybody.

105
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,019
Is there anything new
on YouTube? Michael...

106
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,184
Doesn't even need
to be good. Oh, God!

107
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,693
I can't think.
I need more Mullins.

108
00:05:32,063 --> 00:05:34,861
Listen, Wallace said these
were just rumors, right?

109
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:37,697
So we have no reason to think that
the company's anything but fine.

110
00:05:37,769 --> 00:05:39,168
So if we just go on
with our work,

111
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,068
you and me,
they'll follow along.

112
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,163
Monkey see, monkey do.

113
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,731
That's it.
Monkey pee all over you.

114
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:48,506
That rhymes. So what have
we on the docket today?

115
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,141
We have a monthly
staff meeting.

116
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:55,050
All right!
Let's conference room it up!

117
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,520
Here's the deal, guys. There
is no new information as of yet,

118
00:05:57,589 --> 00:05:59,614
so I suggest we all
just keep working.

119
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:03,024
Sure, I'm a little nervous, but doing
our work will make us feel better.

120
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:05,756
I only slack off
when things are good.

121
00:06:06,564 --> 00:06:09,624
Customers have to use the
coupon code from the website.

122
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:11,293
And as of now, there
is no differentiation

123
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,599
between the letter O and the zero,

124
00:06:13,671 --> 00:06:15,901
but we are working on that.
Stay tuned for that.

125
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:18,340
He needs me.
Seat-save infinity.

126
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:19,569
Okay, great.

127
00:06:19,644 --> 00:06:21,373
Also...
Oh, God! What?

128
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:25,208
Oh, my God.

129
00:06:25,283 --> 00:06:27,012
What?
Michael, what happened?

130
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:29,610
Is there news?
There has been a murder!

131
00:06:29,687 --> 00:06:31,780
What?
What?

132
00:06:31,856 --> 00:06:35,189
There's been a murder
in Savannah.

133
00:06:39,631 --> 00:06:44,261
<i>Games have the power to
distract people from stressful situations.</i>

134
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:46,826
Battleship got me through
my parents' divorce.

135
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:51,069
Operation got me through my
vasectomy, i.e., "My Operation."

136
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,404
I don't think

137
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:54,911
I would have been able to
endure my break-up with Holly

138
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,913
had it not been
for Toss Across.

139
00:06:56,981 --> 00:07:00,576
<i>"Belles, Bourbon, and Bullets, a
murder mystery dinner party game."</i>

140
00:07:00,652 --> 00:07:01,949
It is so much fun.

141
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,716
Everybody plays a character,
we go around the room,

142
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,914
we try to figure out
who did it.

143
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:10,552
Hey, I'm wondering if
this is a terrible idea.

144
00:07:10,628 --> 00:07:13,324
This is my call, Jim. Big
picture stuff. It's about murder.

145
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:15,889
I thought we agreed that we
wouldn't do things like this.

146
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,060
Tube City.
You owe me one.

147
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:22,230
Co-managing is
a give and take.

148
00:07:22,307 --> 00:07:23,831
You have to
pick your battles.

149
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:25,637
One of the battles
that I picked

150
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,008
was to stop Michael
from running plastic tubes

151
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,913
<i>all over the office and
placing hamsters inside of them.</i>

152
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,076
<i>He was gonna call it
Tube City.</i>

153
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:37,754
So, yes,
I do owe him one...

154
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,188
<i>August 5th, 1955.</i>

155
00:07:43,261 --> 00:07:45,855
<i>It's a sad day
down here in Savannah.</i>

156
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,865
<i>Local magnate Bill Bourbon
was killed last night,</i>

157
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,161
<i>and all y'all have
congregated tonight for a meal</i>

158
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:54,296
<i>to celebrate Bill as he
passes on to his great reward.</i>

159
00:07:54,372 --> 00:07:56,670
<i>But you're not just here
to pay your respects.</i>

160
00:07:56,741 --> 00:08:00,006
<i>You have to figure out which of y'all is
the no-account scoundrel who killed him.</i>

161
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,410
This is ridiculous.

162
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,641
There will be food. You
leave, you do not get food.

163
00:08:04,716 --> 00:08:06,343
What kind of food?
Sandwich platters.

164
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,408
I'm in.
Baby carrots.

165
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,385
Okay, here are your
character cards.

166
00:08:13,458 --> 00:08:16,655
Take one, pass it down.
Here is your prop box.

167
00:08:16,728 --> 00:08:19,322
Some of your characters
will have props.

168
00:08:19,397 --> 00:08:22,889
Now, on your character card,
it tells you who you are

169
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,366
and what your alibi is.

170
00:08:24,435 --> 00:08:26,528
Everything else is
up to your imagination.

171
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:30,040
So if you talk slowly
in real life,

172
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,805
your character could, say, have
been kicked in the head by a horse.

173
00:08:33,878 --> 00:08:35,038
Cool. I'll try it.

174
00:08:35,113 --> 00:08:37,513
Okay. Use your
imaginations.

175
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:38,742
Who did you get?

176
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,113
"Naughty Nellie Nutmeg,

177
00:08:40,184 --> 00:08:43,210
"a vivacious young socialite
with a penchant for scandal."

178
00:08:43,288 --> 00:08:44,414
Ooh!

179
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,922
Saucy.
How about you?

180
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,895
"Nathaniel Nutmeg, the local
bartender and Nellie's brother."

181
00:08:53,231 --> 00:08:55,461
Michael, I don't like
this game. It's scary.

182
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,830
It's not scary.

183
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,095
I don't like
my character.

184
00:08:58,169 --> 00:08:59,227
Who are you?

185
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,762
"Voodoo Mama Juju, the witch
doctor of the Savannah swamps."

186
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,068
I'm not comfortable
with this.

187
00:09:04,142 --> 00:09:05,336
Well, how do you
think I feel?

188
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,779
I mean, I have to play "Caleb
Crawdad," handsome playboy.

189
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,509
Every night
a different woman,

190
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:17,714
being ogled, having to
hug and kiss and spoon.

191
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,117
I make them
feel beautiful.

192
00:09:21,192 --> 00:09:23,057
Well, well, well!

193
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:26,255
What is this contraption,
I do declare?

194
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:28,822
It's my BlackBerry, Michael. I'm
trying to get updates on the company.

195
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,427
Who's Michael? I'm Caleb
Crawdad, I do declare.

196
00:09:32,503 --> 00:09:34,164
You don't have to keep
saying, "I do declare,"

197
00:09:34,238 --> 00:09:35,796
anytime you say something,
it means you're declaring.

198
00:09:35,873 --> 00:09:37,397
That is the way
Southern people talk.

199
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:39,443
And what designing woman
are you basing that on?

200
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,876
Delta Burke, I do declare.

201
00:09:41,946 --> 00:09:44,380
Now, shall we get
to the mystery?

202
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:45,677
I'll go.

203
00:09:47,885 --> 00:09:51,651
"My name is Deborah Utante,
Deb for short."

204
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,857
That's clever.
Debutante.

205
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,524
"Bill Bourbon
was my uncle.

206
00:09:58,596 --> 00:10:03,260
"I would have never hurt him any
more than I'd hurt a June bug."

207
00:10:03,334 --> 00:10:05,666
Nice accent. You sound
like Forrest Gump.

208
00:10:05,737 --> 00:10:06,795
I do not.

209
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:08,168
Well, you do, actually.

210
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:11,936
You got this kind of like
Florida Panhandle thing going,

211
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,207
whereas what you really want
is more of a Savannah accent,

212
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,272
which is more like molasses just
sort of spilling out of your mouth.

213
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,215
Oh, now do
the Swedish Chef.

214
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,617
I'm not familiar.
What province is he from?

215
00:10:23,688 --> 00:10:26,486
<i>He lives on Sesame Street,
dumbass.</i>

216
00:10:26,557 --> 00:10:28,991
You know, I think I'm supposed
to say something to Pam,

217
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,755
I mean, Deb. Okay.

218
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:37,201
"I overheard you asking the
butler where the pistol was kept."

219
00:10:37,268 --> 00:10:39,065
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

220
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:41,662
I'm the butler. What, you
were listening in on that?

221
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:43,138
Oh, you rich people,
you think you can do

222
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,765
whatever you want
to the servant class!

223
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,434
No, no, no. Don't turn
this into a political thing.

224
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:48,536
I will poison your food.

225
00:10:48,613 --> 00:10:50,513
I reckon I got
something to say

226
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:53,243
to Miss Beatrix Bourbon,
if she don't mind.

227
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,480
Ooh, doggy!
We got a party now!

228
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,648
I do believe that
the game is a big hit.

229
00:10:59,724 --> 00:11:01,555
People are really diving
into their characters.

230
00:11:02,193 --> 00:11:03,319
Y'all...

231
00:11:10,368 --> 00:11:11,733
I made a mistake.

232
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:13,293
Sorry, I'm late, boss.
What's going on?

233
00:11:13,371 --> 00:11:17,740
Sir, there has
been a murder, and you are a suspect.

234
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:21,575
Okay. Hang on just a second. Let me
settle in, and I'll be right back.

235
00:11:21,646 --> 00:11:23,409
Very good! Very good!

236
00:11:23,481 --> 00:11:26,814
Now, no one was there
in the wine cellar.

237
00:11:40,131 --> 00:11:41,325
Hey there, young lady.

238
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,559
Hello.

239
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:47,127
I would be remiss if I did
not ask the pretty young lady

240
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,969
out on a date
for this weekend.

241
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:52,509
Sounds like a plan, sugar.

242
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:55,740
All right!
A plan it is.

243
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:04,550
Voodoo Mama Juju, explain your
dalliance with the dark arts.

244
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:07,591
<i>It's not my fault. I was
exposed to Harry Potter.</i>

245
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,190
I know you did it!

246
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,889
I know she didn't do it. It's
never the person you most suspect.

247
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:16,331
It's also never the
person you least suspect,

248
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,665
<i>since anyone with half a brain
would suspect them the most.</i>

249
00:12:19,737 --> 00:12:23,730
Therefore, I know the
killer to be Phyllis,

250
00:12:24,542 --> 00:12:30,742
a.k.a. Beatrix Bourbon, the
person I most medium suspect.

251
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,943
Do you want to go out
on a date with me?

252
00:12:35,019 --> 00:12:38,420
We can make out
by the horses.

253
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,890
Well, you know old Nellie is
always up for a romp in the hay.

254
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,087
How about
a threesome?

255
00:12:45,163 --> 00:12:48,326
Yeah.
My boudoir's always open.

256
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,593
Nice.

257
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:53,900
I'm a little worried I might have
asked out Naughty Nellie and not Erin.

258
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:55,131
Which would be a whole
lot less appealing,

259
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:58,039
because Naughty Nellie
says yes to everyone,

260
00:12:58,109 --> 00:13:00,009
and she might be
a murderer.

261
00:13:00,077 --> 00:13:01,601
Follow before...

262
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,273
I just got an e-mail
from corporate,

263
00:13:04,348 --> 00:13:07,317
specifically for Accounting, to
stop all payments to our vendors.

264
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:08,818
What does that mean?

265
00:13:08,886 --> 00:13:11,252
Well, maybe nothing, but it could
be a problem with liquidity...

266
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:13,654
Whoa! What's this
strange Yankee accent

267
00:13:13,724 --> 00:13:15,248
coming out of
your mouth, son?

268
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:17,351
This here is Savannah.

269
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:19,620
Phyllis...

270
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:23,666
This... Plan...

271
00:13:23,734 --> 00:13:29,297
This plantation, we're
running low on greenbacks,

272
00:13:29,373 --> 00:13:32,365
and we're having problems
paying the people

273
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:36,174
who give us the seeds and
the dirt. We can't pay them.

274
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:38,579
Michael, I can't...

275
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:41,948
Basically, it could mean a lot of
things, but it is unprecedented,

276
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:43,043
so it's cause for concern.

277
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,644
Okay, I'm going back
to work.

278
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:46,349
No. No, no, no.
No. No, no.

279
00:13:46,424 --> 00:13:49,154
I'm gonna skip forward to a
really big clue. Here we go.

280
00:13:49,227 --> 00:13:52,993
<i>Well, by now, you figured out
that old Beatrix Bourbon was the killer.</i>

281
00:13:53,064 --> 00:13:54,156
What?

282
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:56,756
Michael, I was
doing so well.

283
00:13:56,834 --> 00:14:00,395
Are you going to believe
that? That is a...

284
00:14:00,471 --> 00:14:02,063
That's a misdirection.

285
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:05,436
We still don't know
who the murderer is.

286
00:14:07,678 --> 00:14:11,478
Nellie Nutmeg, come back in
here! I can't do this myself.

287
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,386
Voodoo Mama Juju.
What am I gonna do?

288
00:14:20,558 --> 00:14:23,391
Okay, so corporate is
still in their meeting.

289
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,793
That could be
a good sign.

290
00:14:25,863 --> 00:14:28,593
Hey, everyone, Kevin's gonna
give us his take on the situation.

291
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,031
Let's listen up.

292
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:32,296
All right, guys, it's a
workday, and you guys work here,

293
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,962
so let's go
do some work.

294
00:14:34,038 --> 00:14:36,598
Now, Jim telling us
all to work,

295
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:39,006
I think that is
a very good sign.

296
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:40,668
Don't just say things.

297
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,144
Oh, good, Michael. Listen, I
wrote up those sales targets...

298
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:49,653
I do believe you have me
mistaken. My name is Caleb Crawdad.

299
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:54,224
Y'all skedaddled way too soon.
We need to reopen this case.

300
00:14:54,292 --> 00:14:56,624
No, you're not re-opening
the case. The case is closed.

301
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:57,786
No, it ain't.

302
00:14:58,496 --> 00:15:00,327
Frankly,
I'm not surprised.

303
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:04,264
A lot of the evidence
seemed to be based on puns.

304
00:15:08,506 --> 00:15:10,133
<i>I was just thinking about
Weekend at Bernie's.</i>

305
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:12,175
So funny. The guy's
dead the whole time.

306
00:15:12,243 --> 00:15:14,143
I haven't seen it.

307
00:15:14,211 --> 00:15:18,375
Speaking of weekends, you excited
about our date this weekend?

308
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:20,576
Of course, Nathaniel.

309
00:15:20,651 --> 00:15:22,050
Okay.

310
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:23,984
Where are you taking me?

311
00:15:24,055 --> 00:15:25,522
Well...

312
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,424
The finest
steakhouse in all Savannah.

313
00:15:28,492 --> 00:15:32,394
Savannah? That's a far way
from Scranton.

314
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,656
Did you mean
a real date?

315
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:36,825
No.

316
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:39,293
Did you?

317
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,997
Totally not.

318
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:53,276
I thought
it was for real.

319
00:15:55,052 --> 00:15:58,419
So I was excited, but
it was part of the game.

320
00:16:00,157 --> 00:16:02,387
You're sure it was water?
It couldn't have been acid?

321
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,361
I already declared you,
it was too dark to tell!

322
00:16:05,429 --> 00:16:06,623
Stop playing games
with me, Crawdad!

323
00:16:06,697 --> 00:16:08,961
This is not a game!
This is my life!

324
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:11,228
You are out of order, sir! Answer me!

325
00:16:11,302 --> 00:16:13,736
You are out of order!
You are out of order!

326
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:16,272
I think Michael
may have snapped.

327
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,967
Or maybe he's just
stuck in character.

328
00:16:18,042 --> 00:16:20,943
Well, which is worse?
Snapped or stuck?

329
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:23,172
Both.
They're both worse.

330
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:28,516
It's gonna be all right.
We're a good company.

331
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:31,817
We'll figure this out.
We're not going under.

332
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,653
Jim, what if we both
lose our jobs?

333
00:16:35,493 --> 00:16:38,087
I'm trying to think of a way
that this all ends up fine,

334
00:16:38,162 --> 00:16:40,027
and I can't
think of one.

335
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:45,194
Deb, what in the world?
Do you have the vapors?

336
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,861
Michael! Not now.
Can't wait.

337
00:16:46,937 --> 00:16:49,599
We have to get you to our
witch doctor right now.

338
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:51,607
Come on, come on!

339
00:16:51,675 --> 00:16:53,108
I should just go.

340
00:16:53,677 --> 00:16:55,144
Where to now, Caleb?

341
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:58,409
To Mama Juju Booboo.

342
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,249
Michael, can I...

343
00:17:02,186 --> 00:17:05,349
Okay, I'm just gonna skip right
past the what and go with why?

344
00:17:05,423 --> 00:17:09,189
Because this is the
recreation of a crime scene.

345
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,285
I'm the dead body, and
these are my brain chunks.

346
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:12,420
Hey, shut up.
You're dead.

347
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:13,724
Michael, can I talk
to you in your office?

348
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:15,823
No Michael here. My name is... Caleb!

349
00:17:22,773 --> 00:17:25,207
Today, of all days?
No! You shut up!

350
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:27,608
They need this game, Jim.

351
00:17:27,678 --> 00:17:30,203
Let us have this stupid
little game, all right?

352
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:36,244
Oh, you startled me!

353
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,086
My stars, my heart nearly
leapt out of my chest.

354
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,385
What can I do you for?

355
00:17:41,459 --> 00:17:44,053
Wallace is on the phone.
He's returning your call.

356
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:45,595
Detective Wallace?

357
00:17:45,663 --> 00:17:48,996
I don't think so. I think it's
David Wallace from Dunder Mifflin.

358
00:17:49,066 --> 00:17:51,728
Oh, shucks!
Tell him I'm not here.

359
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:52,860
You're not gonna
answer the phone?

360
00:17:52,937 --> 00:17:55,599
No, I only answer
to Detective Wallace,

361
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:58,039
'cause I got a warm body
in the other room.

362
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:00,536
I'll take it.

363
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:01,942
Hey, David.

364
00:18:02,012 --> 00:18:05,038
<i>Hey. Sorry to be getting
back to you guys so late.</i>

365
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,241
<i>Things are still
a bit unclear.</i>

366
00:18:06,317 --> 00:18:08,478
<i>We didn't officially
decide anything yet.</i>

367
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:10,213
Oh, okay.

368
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:13,313
<i>But if I can be candid with
you here, Jim, it's not good.</i>

369
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,950
<i>We fully expect to be out of
money by the end of the year.</i>

370
00:18:16,026 --> 00:18:17,357
<i>Insolvent.</i>

371
00:18:19,296 --> 00:18:22,823
<i>So, well, you know what?
I'm sorry. I have to run.</i>

372
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:24,958
<i>But we will talk soon, okay? Sure.</i>

373
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:26,502
<i>Okay. Oh, you know, while I have you,</i>

374
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,936
today I was working on this
pitch for a supermarket chain...

375
00:18:29,006 --> 00:18:31,600
<i>Great... and it would
actually be a big account.</i>

376
00:18:31,675 --> 00:18:32,937
<i>Okay, look,
you know what?</i>

377
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,739
<i>I can't really get my
head around anything</i>

378
00:18:34,812 --> 00:18:36,370
<i>like that right now,
but that's great.</i>

379
00:18:36,447 --> 00:18:38,244
<i>Keep after it,
but I gotta run.</i>

380
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:39,339
<i>Okay.
Thanks, Jim.</i>

381
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,405
See you.

382
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,724
What's the news?

383
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:54,229
Nothing yet.

384
00:18:58,135 --> 00:18:59,796
Well, I guess
that's not...

385
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,634
Well, there is
some bad news.

386
00:19:04,275 --> 00:19:06,505
There has been
another murder.

387
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:11,481
A murder, you say?

388
00:19:12,216 --> 00:19:14,878
I do declare.

389
00:19:14,952 --> 00:19:16,943
Conference room, everyone.

390
00:19:17,721 --> 00:19:19,052
Do we have to play?

391
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,057
No.
Super.

392
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,389
Oh, this could be
a juicy one.

393
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,655
Get in there!
Get in there!

394
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:28,794
<i>I think today was a
good day to have two managers,</i>

395
00:19:28,866 --> 00:19:32,427
<i>because if you're a family stuck on
a lifeboat in the middle of the ocean,</i>

396
00:19:32,503 --> 00:19:35,097
<i>one parent might want
to just keep rowing.</i>

397
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:38,107
<i>But if the other parent
wants to play a game,</i>

398
00:19:38,175 --> 00:19:39,870
<i>it's not because
they're crazy.</i>

399
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:43,846
It's because they're doing it
for the kids. And I get that now.

400
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:49,475
There has been
a lot of murder and a lot of intrigue.

401
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:52,613
My little heart can
barely take it no more.

402
00:19:54,959 --> 00:19:58,793
Today is the hardest
I have worked in a long, long time.

403
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:03,790
I didn't do it!
Okay.

404
00:20:03,867 --> 00:20:06,927
Everybody just calm down. I am calm.

405
00:20:07,004 --> 00:20:10,030
Count of three, we're all
gonna put down our guns.

406
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:12,371
I have crossbows.

407
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:15,037
We'll put down our weaponry
on the count of three.

408
00:20:15,112 --> 00:20:16,170
Okay.

409
00:20:16,246 --> 00:20:17,611
You ready?
- I'm ready.

410
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,945
One, two...

411
00:20:20,017 --> 00:20:21,006
Two.

412
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,677
Three.
Three.

413
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:27,784
Andy revealed himself
to be a double agent,

414
00:20:27,858 --> 00:20:29,826
at which point,
Dwight felt comfortable

415
00:20:29,893 --> 00:20:31,827
revealing that he also
was a double agent,

416
00:20:31,895 --> 00:20:34,796
and then, Michael
announced to everybody that,

417
00:20:34,865 --> 00:20:37,493
get this,
he was a double agent.

418
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:40,365
Oh, and it is 6:00.

419
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,340
Really?

420
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:55,181
It wasn't me! I'm not
going down for this!

421
00:20:55,252 --> 00:20:57,220
Hey, I want
to go home.

422
00:20:57,287 --> 00:20:59,551
Get the keys out of my
purse, start the car.
