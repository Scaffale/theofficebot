1
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:07,866
The fundamentals of business.
The fundamentals of business.

2
00:00:07,939 --> 00:00:11,500
"Mental" is a part of the
word. I have underlined it.

3
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:14,409
Because you're mental if
you don't have a good time.

4
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,844
You have to enjoy it.

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,007
"Fun" is in it.

6
00:00:19,618 --> 00:00:20,607
"Fun"-damental.

7
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:22,050
Oh, right.

8
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,020
Get out.
I know, I know.

9
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:27,354
Yes, so, it all starts
with a handshake.

10
00:00:27,426 --> 00:00:32,329
But you can't just go right to
the selling. You need small talk.

11
00:00:32,397 --> 00:00:35,127
What topics can you
use for small talk?

12
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,828
Golf, stock market,
Dave Matthews.

13
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:39,336
Yes, what else?

14
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:41,804
Small things. Peas,
ball bearings, dimes.

15
00:00:41,873 --> 00:00:42,897
No.

16
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:44,771
The weekend.
Yeah! That's good.

17
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:48,643
Come on up. Meredith, come up
here. Let's do a little something.

18
00:00:48,713 --> 00:00:52,149
So, Meredith and I have
just started conversing,

19
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:54,549
and I will say,
"So, Meredith,

20
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:56,484
"how was your weekend?
What did you do?"

21
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:00,515
Well, I caught my son taking a dump
on the upper part of the toilet.

22
00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:02,116
All right. He calls
it an "upper-decker."

23
00:01:02,194 --> 00:01:04,389
Okay, okay.
God.

24
00:01:04,463 --> 00:01:07,762
What you people don't know about
business, I could fill a book with.

25
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,391
Then do it.
What?

26
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,935
Write a book.

27
00:01:13,138 --> 00:01:16,130
<i>The Fundamentals of Business
by Michael Scott.</i>

28
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,406
Over one billion sold.

29
00:01:19,544 --> 00:01:22,843
More than the Bible. I'm
not surprised. Chapter One.

30
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:28,312
The businessman...

31
00:01:52,511 --> 00:01:54,001
Mr. Grotti,
this is Michael Scott.

32
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,307
He's the person
you should talk to.

33
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,405
Hi. I'm sorry,
just a sec.

34
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,211
Erin, you're
supposed to be the gatekeeper.

35
00:02:00,285 --> 00:02:02,947
Do you have any idea
how valuable my time is?

36
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,819
In your schedule, it just says
9:00 till noon is creative space.

37
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:06,880
I thought this
could be part of that.

38
00:02:06,958 --> 00:02:09,449
Do you know how creative space works?

39
00:02:09,528 --> 00:02:11,393
Okay, fine. Just cancel my afternoon.

40
00:02:11,463 --> 00:02:13,727
You don't have anything in the
afternoon. It just says "free play."

41
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:15,629
Push free play till tomorrow morning.

42
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,137
Hi. Sorry, crazy day. You're
seeing how the sausage gets made.

43
00:02:20,205 --> 00:02:24,369
Come in the conference room and I
will show you a finished sausage.

44
00:02:27,078 --> 00:02:29,603
As a manager of business,
you've got a lot of pride.

45
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:30,705
Hmm.

46
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:33,376
But you also got a
lot of responsibility.

47
00:02:33,451 --> 00:02:34,475
Yep.

48
00:02:34,553 --> 00:02:37,283
None greater, perhaps,
than the need to be sure

49
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:42,759
that your small or large business is
secure in the event of a covered loss.

50
00:02:42,827 --> 00:02:43,987
Okay.

51
00:02:46,064 --> 00:02:49,556
There's nothing more
insulting to a great salesman

52
00:02:49,634 --> 00:02:52,364
than having to listen
to a bad salesman.

53
00:02:53,638 --> 00:02:55,469
It's like a great
basketball player

54
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:58,475
having to listen to a
bad basketball player.

55
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,574
Jim's gone
on his honeymoon.

56
00:03:05,917 --> 00:03:09,614
So, I started borrowing
his office to fart in.

57
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:13,215
Then one day, I came
in and I just stayed.

58
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:17,125
<i>'Cause this place is awesome.
It feels like home now.</i>

59
00:03:17,195 --> 00:03:20,858
Even better than my home.
My home sucks.

60
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:23,666
What do you think?

61
00:03:23,735 --> 00:03:24,793
I think you're right.

62
00:03:24,869 --> 00:03:26,928
Definitely looks
suspicious.

63
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:30,304
And his southern Italian
heritage raises some flags.

64
00:03:31,409 --> 00:03:34,901
God forbid you should have
a fire in the warehouse.

65
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,076
Oh! Yep. Yeah. Definitely.
All that paper burning up.

66
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,779
Yeah, and the truck goes off the
side of the road, there's injury.

67
00:03:42,854 --> 00:03:45,049
Mmm-hmm, I hear you. The truck.

68
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:46,886
You will be hearing
from me, Mr. Scott.

69
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:47,982
Okay, well...

70
00:03:48,059 --> 00:03:50,152
I can be very,
very persistent.

71
00:03:50,228 --> 00:03:51,217
Do your worst.

72
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,091
All right.

73
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:00,604
Would you look
at that, people?

74
00:04:00,672 --> 00:04:03,436
What an unpredictable
world we live in, huh?

75
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,375
Thank you.

76
00:04:08,013 --> 00:04:09,412
What happened in there? Nothing,

77
00:04:09,481 --> 00:04:12,541
other than once again, I am just
thankful that I am a paper salesman.

78
00:04:12,617 --> 00:04:13,641
Did he threaten you?

79
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:15,743
No, Dwight. Not everything is a threat.

80
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,809
Mobsters are.

81
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:19,186
There is no such
thing as monsters.

82
00:04:19,257 --> 00:04:21,225
- He drives an SUV.
- I knew it.

83
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:23,658
More trunk space, or
should I say corpse space.

84
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,492
Okay, guys, I drive an SUV.
Does that mean I'm in the mob?

85
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:30,056
No, not that by itself,
but look at all the facts.

86
00:04:30,135 --> 00:04:32,296
He seems like a mobster.

87
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,429
Wait, when did we start
talking about the mob?

88
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:35,973
The guy was trying
to sell me insurance.

89
00:04:36,041 --> 00:04:37,599
All mobsters
have a front.

90
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:39,371
Sometimes it's
selling insurance,

91
00:04:39,444 --> 00:04:42,345
sometimes it's waste
management or sanitation.

92
00:04:42,414 --> 00:04:45,042
For the record, not all
Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.

93
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,983
I think he just seemed like he
was trying to sell me insurance.

94
00:04:48,053 --> 00:04:50,817
Yeah. "Buy my insurance or
I burn your warehouse down."

95
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:51,913
Exactly.

96
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:54,481
He did talk about
a fire in the warehouse.

97
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,685
And he also vaguely threatened
me with testicular cancer.

98
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,595
All right.
Who else is here?

99
00:05:00,665 --> 00:05:02,530
Pam and Jim are
on their honeymoon,

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,195
so there's not the usual
balance between sane and others.

101
00:05:06,271 --> 00:05:09,172
Toby has mentally
checked out since June.

102
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,768
It's a very dangerous time. The
coalition for reason is extremely weak.

103
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,540
Oscar says
I checked out, huh?

104
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:19,005
Huh!

105
00:05:19,517 --> 00:05:20,814
This is bad. All right.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

106
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,750
Calm down,
calm down, calm down.

107
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,379
Ryan, you lived in New
York, what do you think?

108
00:05:24,456 --> 00:05:27,220
Well, first of all, there's
no such thing as the Mafia.

109
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:30,284
Okay. What you have
are specific families.

110
00:05:30,361 --> 00:05:31,828
What's the guy's
last name?

111
00:05:31,896 --> 00:05:33,989
Um, it is Grotti.

112
00:05:34,065 --> 00:05:35,692
Oh, no.
That is...

113
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:36,859
What? What?

114
00:05:36,935 --> 00:05:38,903
John Gotti, you idiot.

115
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,165
It's a completely
different name.

116
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,763
So he won't get caught. DWIGHT: Yeah.

117
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:43,899
It's pretty close.

118
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,964
What are you
talking about?

119
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:48,240
What mobster would change his name
from Gotti to Grotti? It weakens it.

120
00:05:48,313 --> 00:05:51,942
No, I disagree. "R" is among
the most menacing of sounds.

121
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:54,177
That's why they call it
"murder," not "mukduk."

122
00:05:54,252 --> 00:05:58,518
Okay, too many different words coming
at me from too many different sentences.

123
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,579
Lock your door.

124
00:05:59,657 --> 00:06:01,716
I'm not going
to lock my door.

125
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,829
<i>Hello?
Jim, it's Oscar.</i>

126
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,991
I'm so sorry to be calling
you on your honeymoon.

127
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,194
<i>Oscar,
what is going on?</i>

128
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:15,730
It's Michael. He thinks he's
being shaken down by the mob.

129
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,604
I don't know how you
usually handle this.

130
00:06:17,675 --> 00:06:19,404
<i>We're in
Puerto Rico, so...</i>

131
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,604
<i>Hey, Oscar. It's Pam, hey. Hey.</i>

132
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,703
<i>We're on our
honeymoon.</i>

133
00:06:22,781 --> 00:06:23,770
Pam, I'm sorry.

134
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,145
<i>Unless someone
very close to us</i>

135
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:26,478
<i>is in immediate
physical danger,</i>

136
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:27,882
<i>you should not
be calling us.</i>

137
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,249
You're right,
you're right.

138
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,720
All right. Okay, bye.

139
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,918
It's from Grotti.
He's following up.

140
00:06:36,995 --> 00:06:38,053
Already?

141
00:06:38,129 --> 00:06:40,495
This guy's persistent.

142
00:06:40,565 --> 00:06:43,898
Okay. "I feel that
you will regret

143
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,630
"missing this great
opportunity to be in business."

144
00:06:47,739 --> 00:06:49,604
That's bad. That's bad. Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:52,472
What are my options here?
Do I just ignore it or...

146
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:55,035
Yeah, right.
You heard him,

147
00:06:55,113 --> 00:06:56,512
he's going to burn
the warehouse down

148
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:57,946
or run one of our
trucks off the road.

149
00:06:58,016 --> 00:06:59,483
Okay, I'm calling
the police.

150
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,119
That is the stupidest thing
you could do right now.

151
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,850
No, he's right.
Cops can't do anything

152
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,118
until a crime
has been reported.

153
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:08,181
All right.
Not only that,

154
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:09,851
but if they find out you snitched,

155
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:12,988
you get a dead horse's
chopped off head in your bed.

156
00:07:13,064 --> 00:07:14,497
You know what?
That's not going to happen.

157
00:07:14,566 --> 00:07:15,931
That's an exaggeration.
- That's how it works.

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,228
What am I
supposed to do here?

159
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:20,601
When somebody threatens you,
you give in right away.

160
00:07:20,672 --> 00:07:23,232
Okay, you need to buy insurance from
this guy and get him off your back.

161
00:07:23,308 --> 00:07:24,400
I was thinking exactly the same thing.

162
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,739
No. Criminals are like
raccoons, okay?

163
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:27,835
You give them
a taste of cat food,

164
00:07:27,912 --> 00:07:29,709
pretty soon they'll be
back for the whole cat.

165
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:31,510
Dwight. The only way to defeat a bully

166
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,746
is to stand up to him. Trust me,
I have bullied a lot of people.

167
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:36,047
I don't know. I don't know about that.

168
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,145
Wait. Let's hear him out.
This is interesting.

169
00:07:38,223 --> 00:07:41,090
Here's what we do. We
meet him in a public place,

170
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,922
ask him to lunch
or something like that.

171
00:07:42,994 --> 00:07:44,962
Someplace where he
can't be openly violent.

172
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:46,189
Okay.
Let him know

173
00:07:46,264 --> 00:07:48,755
that you are not the typical kind
of guy that he can shake down,

174
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,496
that you're stubborn, that you
might even be a little bit dangerous.

175
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,834
I like this plan. I'd like to
officially withdraw my plan.

176
00:07:54,906 --> 00:07:56,271
Hold on, hold on,
just...

177
00:07:56,341 --> 00:07:57,638
No, no, no, no.
My plan is out.

178
00:07:57,709 --> 00:07:59,142
We do it the hard way.

179
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:02,611
All right, I will meet with
him, but I'm not going alone.

180
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,808
Well, you're going to
have to. We'll be right beside you.

181
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:06,908
What?

182
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:12,453
All right.

183
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:23,496
What are you wearing?
Who's Pat?

184
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:27,026
If I'm going to back you up, I need
a weapon without drawing suspicion.

185
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,572
And I have to
justify it somehow,

186
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,904
so I'm a mechanic
with a tire thing.

187
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,135
Do you know
how to use it?

188
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,734
To change tires, no.

189
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:36,211
But, I mean, it's metal,
I can hit somebody with it.

190
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:37,976
Let's go, come on.

191
00:08:38,716 --> 00:08:40,809
God. God.

192
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,687
Should I change?
You're wearing loafers.

193
00:08:43,755 --> 00:08:45,746
Forget it.
Forget it.

194
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,188
Take that thing off
the table. Please.

195
00:08:52,664 --> 00:08:56,031
Well, then I can't use it.
I'm just going to hide it.

196
00:08:57,902 --> 00:09:00,894
Hey. The bathroom
checks out clean.

197
00:09:00,972 --> 00:09:02,872
Nothing behind the toilet
except this roach motel.

198
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:04,806
No! God!
Oh, my God.

199
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,503
You'll never kill it that way. Guys.

200
00:09:06,577 --> 00:09:07,908
You want to separate
the head from the thorax.

201
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:10,641
Guys, guys. Cool it.

202
00:09:11,382 --> 00:09:13,373
There he is, there he is.

203
00:09:15,253 --> 00:09:16,811
Hello.
Mr. Scott, hello.

204
00:09:16,888 --> 00:09:20,881
Mr. Grotti, we meet again.
These are my associates.

205
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,221
Hi, Angelo Grotti.

206
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:23,351
Hi.
Hello.

207
00:09:23,428 --> 00:09:25,453
So...
You got this table?

208
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,327
Yes. What's this, one
of them half-booths,

209
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:28,695
can't-decide-what-it-is
type of thing?

210
00:09:28,766 --> 00:09:29,926
Well...

211
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:32,993
Waitress, we're going
to sit over here.

212
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,299
That's fine.

213
00:09:34,372 --> 00:09:35,464
Okay.

214
00:09:43,848 --> 00:09:44,837
Hello?

215
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:45,974
<i>Hello, Mr. Halpert.</i>

216
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,076
<i>I'm calling from the Identity
Theft department at Capital One.</i>

217
00:09:49,153 --> 00:09:52,145
<i>We've detected some unusual
activity on your credit card.</i>

218
00:09:52,223 --> 00:09:54,783
Oh, man. Do you think
it was stolen?

219
00:09:54,859 --> 00:09:57,953
<i>First, would you mind
verifying your home address?</i>

220
00:09:58,029 --> 00:09:59,155
Um... Yes.

221
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,792
383 Linden Ave.,
Scranton, PA.

222
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,361
<i>And may I have the last four
digits of your social security?</i>

223
00:10:08,439 --> 00:10:10,066
Six-six-five-zero.

224
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,134
<i>Well, Mr. Halpert, you're obviously
not in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

225
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:15,543
Wait a minute.
Yes, I am.

226
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:17,410
<i>I'm going to go ahead
and put a hold on your card.</i>

227
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:19,746
No. That... I...

228
00:10:20,385 --> 00:10:24,651
I think that we should let the
criminal use the card a little longer.

229
00:10:24,956 --> 00:10:27,982
<i>Very funny, sir. We'll get a
new card out to you right away.</i>

230
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,584
<i>No. Have a nice day and thank you.</i>

231
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,421
Shoot.

232
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,697
If you want to supplement
your coverage, we can do that.

233
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,331
If you want to replace your
current coverage, all the better.

234
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,601
Hey, you seem
like a nice guy.

235
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:44,868
Oh, he's not that nice.

236
00:10:44,976 --> 00:10:46,409
That's true.
Mmm-hmm.

237
00:10:46,978 --> 00:10:48,605
That's very true.
Okay, shut up.

238
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,476
Have you decided?

239
00:10:50,548 --> 00:10:53,642
Yeah, I'll have the linguini,
red sauce on the side.

240
00:10:53,718 --> 00:10:57,245
If the sauce does not come on
the side, I will send it back.

241
00:10:57,321 --> 00:10:59,755
I want garlic bread,
toasted, not burnt.

242
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:02,190
If it comes burnt,
I will send it back.

243
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,195
Okay, then.
And for you, sir?

244
00:11:05,263 --> 00:11:06,628
I will have
the gabbagool.

245
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:08,560
The what?

246
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,433
The gabbagool.

247
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,899
I don't really know
what that is.

248
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:15,666
You know,
gabbagool.

249
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,105
I don't have to have that.

250
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:18,972
What he's trying to
say is, gabbagool.

251
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:20,032
Guys, guys,
all right.

252
00:11:20,111 --> 00:11:21,203
I don't really think
that we have that.

253
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:22,940
That's okay. Bring him the gabbagool.

254
00:11:23,014 --> 00:11:26,381
I will have the
spaghetti with a side salad.

255
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:27,543
Okay.

256
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:30,414
If the salad is on top,
I send it back.

257
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:33,488
Why would you cancel
Jim's credit cards?

258
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:35,549
I usually can think
quick on my feet,

259
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,526
but they were so
fast on the phone.

260
00:11:37,595 --> 00:11:39,495
This constitutes
identity fraud.

261
00:11:39,564 --> 00:11:40,792
Oh, God.

262
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:44,229
I wouldn't last in jail,
Oscar. I'm not like you.

263
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:47,200
What's that
supposed to mean?

264
00:11:47,271 --> 00:11:49,171
What, you don't
know about jail?

265
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,367
You would love jail.

266
00:11:51,676 --> 00:11:53,109
Why would I love jail?

267
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:56,613
Because...
You would love it.

268
00:11:58,516 --> 00:12:03,613
I don't think our company actually
needs any more insurance. So, I am out.

269
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:07,317
Look closely, Michael. I feel
there's a plan here for you.

270
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:10,220
Maybe we have
a plan for you.

271
00:12:10,828 --> 00:12:12,125
How about you?

272
00:12:12,196 --> 00:12:15,188
Maybe you can use supplemental
coverage of some kind.

273
00:12:15,266 --> 00:12:16,893
Anybody can get hurt.

274
00:12:16,968 --> 00:12:19,368
You always think it can't
happen to you, and...

275
00:12:21,472 --> 00:12:22,803
Think about it.

276
00:12:22,874 --> 00:12:25,104
Excuse me.
Sorry to bother you.

277
00:12:25,176 --> 00:12:26,336
Are you a mechanic?

278
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,468
Yeah.

279
00:12:27,545 --> 00:12:29,911
My battery's dead. I've got
my kid. Can you please help?

280
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:30,970
Yes, I can.

281
00:12:31,048 --> 00:12:32,242
No, no, no,
no, come on.

282
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,749
I'm sorry, we're
having our salads.

283
00:12:33,818 --> 00:12:36,150
Come on,
lady in distress.

284
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,209
Go, go.

285
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:39,085
Okay. Sorry.

286
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:42,422
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

287
00:12:42,493 --> 00:12:43,653
Hey, do you
need any help?

288
00:12:43,728 --> 00:12:46,492
I'm sure he can handle
a simple jumpstart.

289
00:12:46,564 --> 00:12:48,054
Now, come on, sit down.

290
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:49,121
He's a good mechanic.

291
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,428
Sit down.

292
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:52,662
Where were we?
I don't...

293
00:12:52,737 --> 00:12:55,035
He was trying to force you to
sign a policy. Okay, okay, okay.

294
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,097
So, we're choosing...
Okay. Yep.

295
00:12:57,175 --> 00:13:00,144
Did you check out Dental?
All right, put it down.

296
00:13:00,211 --> 00:13:05,706
Black goes on the red with
the... If we... Positive...

297
00:13:07,018 --> 00:13:10,579
It being a motor drive,
it's probably down.

298
00:13:10,655 --> 00:13:12,486
He seems bad at this.

299
00:13:12,557 --> 00:13:15,526
You want to do this, junior?
I didn't think so.

300
00:13:16,594 --> 00:13:20,655
I'm sorry, just had kind of a
long day at the mechanic store.

301
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:28,394
You've got
a leaky spark tube.

302
00:13:28,472 --> 00:13:29,461
What?

303
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,201
So, your car's totaled.

304
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,573
You're gonna want to
get a refund on that.

305
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:37,011
Or my guy could do it, he's
great. But I can't do that for you.

306
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,777
I work exclusively
on motorcycles.

307
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:42,950
All right.

308
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,653
Now, if you could just sign
this letter of intent,

309
00:13:47,725 --> 00:13:49,852
I'll bring this
back to my boss

310
00:13:49,927 --> 00:13:51,292
and we can get
this in motion.

311
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,289
You okay, Pat?

312
00:13:57,368 --> 00:13:58,357
Yeah, I was
just thinking

313
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:03,930
about how I had this car.
It was this Italian car.

314
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:05,839
And I was driving it,

315
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,844
and it kept
telling me how much

316
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:10,380
it needed oil, but I
wouldn't give it any oil.

317
00:14:10,448 --> 00:14:13,349
And then, one day it exploded
and it killed everyone,

318
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,044
and that's what
I'm afraid of.

319
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:17,644
Aren't you a mechanic? Why
wouldn't you put oil in a car?

320
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:20,247
It was before my
technical training.

321
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,554
Don't do it.

322
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:24,518
Do it.

323
00:14:24,595 --> 00:14:26,153
Don't.
Just do it.

324
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,323
Okay.
Don't do it.

325
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,062
Look, Mike, I don't know what
your friends are telling you,

326
00:14:32,136 --> 00:14:35,037
but you have to
decide for yourself.

327
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:37,097
I mean, are these guys
going to take care

328
00:14:37,174 --> 00:14:38,698
of your things
if you die tomorrow?

329
00:14:38,776 --> 00:14:39,834
Yes.

330
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:43,168
Okay.

331
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,044
I don't understand. Why
would you buy a policy?

332
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,143
It's just the cost of
a cup of coffee an hour.

333
00:14:49,353 --> 00:14:51,878
You were man enough to back
down, Michael. I'm proud of you.

334
00:14:51,956 --> 00:14:53,821
I had to make
a snap decision, Dwight.

335
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,189
It wasn't a snap decision. You
were sitting there for an hour.

336
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,455
It was a lot of
snap decisions.

337
00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:00,258
Do you know what "snap
decision" means? MICHAEL: Yes.

338
00:15:00,331 --> 00:15:01,320
It means like this.

339
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:03,162
Just
get in the car.

340
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:06,793
<i>Hello?
Jim?</i>

341
00:15:06,871 --> 00:15:08,839
<i>Michael?
Oh, thank God.</i>

342
00:15:08,906 --> 00:15:10,840
<i>How did you get this number?</i>

343
00:15:10,908 --> 00:15:11,932
<i>Michael, we're on
a catamaran.</i>

344
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:12,998
It wasn't easy.

345
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,739
I had to tell the hotel that
it was a medical emergency.

346
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,212
I chose a massive
coronary because

347
00:15:17,281 --> 00:15:19,442
you told me that your
dad had a bad heart.

348
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:23,146
Listen, man,
I got a problem.

349
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:27,247
I think I'm in trouble with the
mob or a major insurance carrier.

350
00:15:27,325 --> 00:15:29,190
<i>That sounds bad.
Yeah, I know.</i>

351
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,694
And you usually can get
out of stuff like this,

352
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,252
so I'm turning to you,
my friend.

353
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:34,355
<i>I'm going to help you
through it, all right?</i>

354
00:15:34,432 --> 00:15:35,421
Okay.

355
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:37,399
<i>All you're going
to need...</i>

356
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,397
<i>And then go to...</i>

357
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:41,665
Jim. Are you...

358
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:43,263
<i>And you'll be saved.</i>

359
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,605
What? Wait. I didn't hear
a thing you just said.

360
00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:47,644
<i>Just... And then
you'll be saved.</i>

361
00:15:47,712 --> 00:15:50,408
No! God, I missed
the important part again.

362
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:52,980
No. Oh, my God.

363
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,574
<i>And you'll be saved.
No, Jim.</i>

364
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:57,587
Please repeat what you're
saying, I can't understand you.

365
00:15:58,556 --> 00:16:02,287
<i>Bermuda Triangle...
Please don't call again.</i>

366
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,486
Jim?

367
00:16:07,064 --> 00:16:08,429
Oh, my God.

368
00:16:16,774 --> 00:16:19,743
Hey, question for you.

369
00:16:21,045 --> 00:16:26,176
I recently purchased some insurance that
I can't afford given my present salary.

370
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:28,543
Is there anything
accounting-wise I can do

371
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,110
to sort of make
it all go away?

372
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:34,680
Accounting-wise, no, but phone-wise,
just call up and cancel it.

373
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:36,021
No, no.

374
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,752
Um...

375
00:16:38,229 --> 00:16:40,959
What about this Cash
for Clunkers thing?

376
00:16:42,166 --> 00:16:44,657
Just, no. No.

377
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:48,136
Okay. All right, well,
it was a thought. Thanks.

378
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,840
We have let Michael down,
and it's 85% your fault.

379
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,781
He's alive,
so you're welcome.

380
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:03,081
Not on the inside,
he's not.

381
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:08,888
Look at his life. Broke, living
in fear, no friends, dead-end job.

382
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,223
Yeah, some of that
existed before.

383
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:13,092
Not the living in fear,
that's new.

384
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,153
You're right,
that is new.

385
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:15,858
Yes.

386
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:17,833
He's got to stand up
to this Mafia guy.

387
00:17:17,902 --> 00:17:19,460
Well, I don't see
that happening.

388
00:17:19,537 --> 00:17:20,663
Me neither.

389
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,763
Not the way
things are now.

390
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:27,038
But what if Michael felt no
fear toward the Mafia guy?

391
00:17:27,111 --> 00:17:28,100
Are you saying...
Yeah.

392
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,478
...that we surgically remove the
fear center from Michael's brain?

393
00:17:31,549 --> 00:17:32,641
What is wrong
with you?

394
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,685
I am talking about convincing
Michael that the guy's not Mafia.

395
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:37,311
That seems
a little farfetched.

396
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:40,289
What, more farfetched than a
mobster walking into a paper company

397
00:17:40,357 --> 00:17:43,292
for a low-level shakedown?
And that happened.

398
00:17:44,862 --> 00:17:49,128
Michael, incredible
news. Grotti is clean.

399
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,626
No, he's not.
He's just good.

400
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,096
Nothing sticks to him. You still
don't understand how this works.

401
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:58,266
No, Michael, what
we're trying to say is,

402
00:17:58,342 --> 00:18:00,902
we made a mistake
assuming he was Mafia.

403
00:18:00,978 --> 00:18:05,039
I have a buddy who's a Fed and we
did a background check on the guy,

404
00:18:05,115 --> 00:18:06,776
his background
is perfectly clean.

405
00:18:06,851 --> 00:18:07,943
It's true,
he's clean.

406
00:18:08,018 --> 00:18:10,782
I have a couple of friends still
on the force, checked with them,

407
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:13,517
ran his Fed friend up the flagpole
to make sure he wasn't on the take.

408
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:14,956
Turns out he's a totally lovely guy.

409
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,322
Sweetest guy on the force, really.

410
00:18:16,393 --> 00:18:17,985
Class act.
Boy scout.

411
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:19,962
But Grotti acts like
he's Mafia, though.

412
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,895
He's trying to intimidate
you to close sales.

413
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:23,456
He's just
a pushy salesman.

414
00:18:23,534 --> 00:18:26,196
And he made us all
look like chumps.

415
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:32,641
If there is one thing I hate
more than the Mafia, it is a liar.

416
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:36,102
I wish the Mafia would go
out and kill all the liars.

417
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,480
And bury them in my yard. And I
wouldn't tell the cops a thing.

418
00:18:41,485 --> 00:18:43,146
Not that I would
be lying, per se,

419
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,916
but I would just get really
quiet all of a sudden.

420
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,958
<i>This is
Grotti. This is Scott.</i>

421
00:18:48,025 --> 00:18:51,688
<i>Oh! Great, Michael. I'm just
finishing up your paperwork right now.</i>

422
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:54,356
Oh, really? Is that
supposed to scare me?

423
00:18:54,932 --> 00:18:56,194
<i>I thought
you'd be pleased.</i>

424
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,394
Well, you thought wrong.

425
00:18:58,536 --> 00:19:00,902
Because I am not pleased.
I'm actually kind of p.o.'d.

426
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:02,734
<i>Why? I think you know exactly why.</i>

427
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:06,867
Because you were trying to
scare me into buying insurance.

428
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,673
<i>I don't get it.
How was I scaring you?</i>

429
00:19:08,746 --> 00:19:10,941
I think you knew exactly
what you were doing,

430
00:19:11,015 --> 00:19:13,848
and frankly, I think you were
being a total and utter jerk.

431
00:19:13,918 --> 00:19:14,942
Ooh, okay.

432
00:19:15,019 --> 00:19:16,452
You suck.
- Okay. That's...

433
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,283
And I'm not going to buy
your stupid insurance.

434
00:19:18,355 --> 00:19:20,050
That's good, let's wrap it
up. Okay. How about that?

435
00:19:20,124 --> 00:19:22,285
The only person that actually
needs insurance is you,

436
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:24,350
if you show your face
around here again. Got it?

437
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:27,022
<i>Look, Michael, when
we all calm down here,</i>

438
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:28,689
<i>maybe at some point
in the future,</i>

439
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:30,927
<i>you change your mind, why
don't you give me a call?</i>

440
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,263
Doubt it.

441
00:19:35,172 --> 00:19:36,264
Oh, man.

442
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,001
What a tool.

443
00:19:42,379 --> 00:19:43,368
What?

444
00:19:43,447 --> 00:19:44,573
Next time you look
in the mirror,

445
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:49,085
you're going to be looking at
a guy who stood down the Mafia.

446
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,015
No. What do you mean?

447
00:19:52,089 --> 00:19:55,820
We just told you he wasn't
Mafia so you wouldn't be scared.

448
00:19:57,027 --> 00:19:58,016
What?

449
00:19:58,095 --> 00:20:00,586
You successfully
backed down the mob.

450
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:05,328
You made the Mafia apologize to
you. You made the Mafia be polite.

451
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:07,665
Oh, man.

452
00:20:10,474 --> 00:20:12,635
I should be mad
at you guys.

453
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,268
But I'm not.

454
00:20:15,346 --> 00:20:17,974
So, I looked him
in the eye and I said,

455
00:20:18,048 --> 00:20:20,516
"Not today, Grotti.
Not today.

456
00:20:20,584 --> 00:20:24,680
"And not tomorrow, and not the
next day, or the day after that.

457
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,746
"And you can tell
all your friends that

458
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:29,987
"if I see them,
then they are already dead."

459
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,322
I said something like that.

460
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:32,419
Very close.

461
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:33,485
Just to be clear,
he backed down

462
00:20:33,564 --> 00:20:35,589
an insurance agent from
Mutual of Harrisburg.

463
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:36,655
Erin?
- Yes?

464
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:37,928
Coffee.
Okay.

465
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:40,300
Not from the kitchen,
Stop & Shop.

466
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,861
If it's not Stop & Shop,
I send it back.

467
00:20:41,939 --> 00:20:42,928
Okay.

468
00:20:43,007 --> 00:20:45,032
Large. If it's a medium, I send it back.

469
00:20:45,109 --> 00:20:47,339
If it's an extra large,
I send it back.

470
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:48,776
How do you
return coffee?

471
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:49,870
Go.

472
00:20:51,649 --> 00:20:53,139
Any questions?

473
00:20:55,552 --> 00:20:56,814
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

474
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,048
Hi, Pam. Is Jim there?

475
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:01,683
<i>Listen, our credit card has been
canceled and we have to deal with that.</i>

476
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,785
<i>And I really can't handle the
fact that you're calling us here.</i>

477
00:21:04,862 --> 00:21:08,229
Okay, that sounds good.
I'll let you go.

478
00:21:08,298 --> 00:21:12,826
Just tell Jim
that I said hi.

479
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:17,237
<i>I will. I will, Kevin. I will
make that my top priority.</i>

480
00:21:17,307 --> 00:21:19,002
Cool. Okay. Bye.

481
00:21:22,446 --> 00:21:24,778
They have no idea
what happened.
