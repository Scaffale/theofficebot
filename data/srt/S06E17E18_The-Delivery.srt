1
00:00:02,434 --> 00:00:04,425
I just wanted to check and see
if there was anything you needed

2
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:06,368
before I went on
my maternity leave.

3
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,569
Yeah.
I'm pregnant.

4
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:11,670
Great. Well,
I'll write up the order.

5
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:12,801
Wait a minute.
Okay, thanks.

6
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:16,746
You can't do that. You cannot
exploit your baby for sales.

7
00:00:16,815 --> 00:00:18,783
Hey, did I tell you
we're gonna have a baby?

8
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,683
Thank you very
much. I'm excited... Oh.

9
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,385
Definitely.
No. No!

10
00:00:24,556 --> 00:00:26,148
You need to come by
your sales honorably.

11
00:00:26,224 --> 00:00:28,784
There is nothing dishonorable
about talking about your life.

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,384
People like it.

13
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:33,794
Hey, there.
Dwight Schrute here.

14
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:37,426
Listen, uh, would you be
interested in restocking on paper?

15
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,703
Yeah, I could sure
use the money.

16
00:00:39,771 --> 00:00:43,605
My cousin came down with a case
of that nasty new goat fungus.

17
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:46,138
Oh, it's just horrific.

18
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:49,112
The doctor says he's never
seen it beard so quickly.

19
00:00:49,181 --> 00:00:50,273
Okay.

20
00:00:54,152 --> 00:00:57,781
I need a baby. I'll never
outsell Jim and Pam without one.

21
00:00:58,423 --> 00:01:01,620
Also, I've been noticing
a gaping hole in my life.

22
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,255
Sometimes I wake up
cradling a gourd.

23
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:28,343
Kevin, you're
such a gourmand.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,412
I cooked my way through
Julia Child's cookbook,

25
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:34,220
<i>and now I'm halfway through
The Twilight Cookbook.</i>

26
00:01:34,292 --> 00:01:37,284
Last night, I had
Edward's cornflake chicken.

27
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:38,687
Hmm.

28
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:42,164
<i>Pregnant Pam and I, we
get hungry at the same times,</i>

29
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:45,632
so we've been eating
together a lot. Not all meals.

30
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:51,035
Just second breakfast, lunch,
second lunch and first dinner.

31
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,708
I thought that maybe we should do
something special for early dinner.

32
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,181
One last ultra feast.

33
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:02,152
Mmm. That sounds great.
What are you thinking?

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,710
I think it should be
a surprise.

35
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:07,185
Getting there, huh?

36
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,851
No, no. I still have time.

37
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:12,294
I'm having contractions, but
they're irregular and far apart.

38
00:02:12,364 --> 00:02:15,663
So I'm not really in labor,
I'm near labor.

39
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:18,066
Yeah. We're slow-playing it
because of our stupid HMO.

40
00:02:18,136 --> 00:02:19,228
<i>If we check in
after midnight,</i>

41
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:21,795
<i>I get an extra day to
recuperate surrounded by doctors.</i>

42
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:23,340
<i>Not to mention
the extra night's sleep</i>

43
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:24,739
<i>in the hospital
will be very nice,</i>

44
00:02:24,809 --> 00:02:26,743
because once we
bring the baby home,

45
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:29,871
if it's crying all night, one of
us is gonna have to take care of it,

46
00:02:29,948 --> 00:02:32,815
and I do not plan on
helping unless it's a boy.

47
00:02:32,884 --> 00:02:35,444
I cannot wait for
that joke to be over.

48
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:36,576
Oh.

49
00:02:38,123 --> 00:02:41,615
Contraptions! She's
contrapting! Okay, you know what?

50
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,524
I think that I should drive you guys
to the hospital, and here is why.

51
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:47,497
I am a licensed Class C driver
in the state of Pennsylvania.

52
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,090
Michael.
I gassed up the car.

53
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,260
Actually, I put diesel in this
time. Tried to save some money.

54
00:02:51,336 --> 00:02:52,360
Michael, you shouldn't
have done that.

55
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:53,461
Happy to do it.

56
00:02:53,538 --> 00:02:56,507
Also, I did a heck of a job
baby-proofing this office.

57
00:02:56,575 --> 00:02:58,167
You know the baby's not
gonna live here, right?

58
00:02:58,243 --> 00:02:59,835
Well, the baby
was conceived here,

59
00:02:59,911 --> 00:03:01,469
so might as well live
here a little bit, too.

60
00:03:01,546 --> 00:03:04,947
Mmm. That logic's airtight, but
unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.

61
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,313
Burning Man, Porta Potty.

62
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:10,013
Yuck! TMI. How was it?

63
00:03:10,589 --> 00:03:13,387
I don't want to know. Tell me
later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!

64
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,187
Okay, okay, we're not
going to the hospital.

65
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,386
We are waiting
until midnight.

66
00:03:16,461 --> 00:03:18,691
Ooh! Spooky. But why?

67
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:21,254
Because the insurance company
only covers two nights.

68
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:23,096
Everything's fine.
We have plenty of time.

69
00:03:23,168 --> 00:03:24,829
Well, you don't want
to wait too long, Pam.

70
00:03:24,903 --> 00:03:26,598
Otherwise the baby's gonna
become a teenager in there,

71
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:28,832
and you'll be up all night
from the rock music.

72
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:32,468
Shut up, Nick. God!
What a weird thing to say.

73
00:03:33,044 --> 00:03:37,140
Weird IT nerd. Don't
get revenge on me, nerd.

74
00:03:39,384 --> 00:03:41,352
What are you looking at?

75
00:03:42,587 --> 00:03:43,679
Nerd.

76
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:46,153
<i>Did you know that
labor can last weeks?</i>

77
00:03:46,224 --> 00:03:48,988
<i>Then they take your insides out
and they just plop them on a table,</i>

78
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,894
and sometimes epidurals don't
work, and you can poop yourself.

79
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,467
Bear my child.

80
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:02,364
Excuse me?

81
00:04:02,741 --> 00:04:04,265
I want to have a child
for business reasons

82
00:04:04,342 --> 00:04:05,832
and I want you
to be the mother.

83
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:07,639
If you agree,
say nothing.

84
00:04:07,712 --> 00:04:09,475
If you disagree,
say anything.

85
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,717
Very well.
Let's meet at 4:00 p.m.

86
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:17,914
In our old meeting spot
and bang it out.

87
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:26,697
That's seven minutes.
Here we go.

88
00:04:26,765 --> 00:04:27,857
Hold on. Hold on.
This is happening.

89
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:28,990
It isn't midnight yet.

90
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,591
Are you serious? Pam.

91
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,399
No, the doctor said
every five to seven minutes.

92
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,837
I'm gonna be okay. We should
really try to make it to midnight.

93
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:36,896
Pam, please.

94
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:38,033
Yeah, no,
you really should,

95
00:04:38,109 --> 00:04:39,736
'cause if your
baby's born tomorrow,

96
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:41,210
he's gonna have
the same birthday

97
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:43,611
as Buttmud Brooks,
my old roommate.

98
00:04:43,682 --> 00:04:46,116
Did you hear that?
Buttmud Brooks.

99
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,515
Okay, but we are leaving
at five minutes apart.

100
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,318
Five minutes apart.

101
00:04:53,658 --> 00:04:57,116
So the plan was seven minutes,
but we're calling an audible,

102
00:04:57,195 --> 00:05:00,631
because that's her call,
'cause she's the quarterback.

103
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,028
I'm just the left tackle who
happened to get her pregnant.

104
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:11,566
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay. Stop watching me.

105
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,505
Okay, Crazy.

106
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,102
I think I have some better
things to do with my day

107
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,648
than worry about you.
Like sell printers.

108
00:05:17,716 --> 00:05:18,774
Mmm-hmm.

109
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,149
Well, now until Friday, 20% off all
toner cartridges, that's a big deal.

110
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,848
While we're on the subject, why don't
I just run you down to the hospital

111
00:05:24,923 --> 00:05:26,185
and just do a quick
check?

112
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:27,986
Not till midnight.

113
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:33,156
Guys, a word of advice,
speaking as a former baby.

114
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,490
Don't get too hung
up on baby names.

115
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:39,401
I was named Walter Junior
after my father,

116
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:43,002
until I was about six or so, when
my parents changed their minds.

117
00:05:43,074 --> 00:05:45,508
I thought you said your younger
brother was named Walter Junior.

118
00:05:45,577 --> 00:05:47,636
My brother was born

119
00:05:47,712 --> 00:05:50,943
and my parents felt he better
exemplified the Walter Junior name,

120
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:53,745
so they gave it to him.
I was given Andrew,

121
00:05:53,818 --> 00:05:56,013
which they got out
of a baby-name book.

122
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:58,084
You know what? It's getting
really crowded in here.

123
00:05:58,156 --> 00:06:00,488
Maybe you guys should all go back
to work 'cause the day's not out yet.

124
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,855
No, no, no.
You know what?

125
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:03,018
You can't tell us
what to do

126
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:04,823
because you are not
co-manager anymore.

127
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:05,954
Yes!

128
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:08,396
I feel like this noise
is gonna prevent Pam

129
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,457
from being able to listen
to her body's signals.

130
00:06:10,535 --> 00:06:12,696
Actually,
the distractions are good.

131
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:14,068
I don't think I'm gonna
make it till midnight

132
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,663
if I'm just sitting here
thinking about it.

133
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,867
Distractions are good!

134
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:21,969
That means conference room, five
minutes. No, no, five seconds!

135
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:24,975
Right now, right now,
conference room.

136
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:26,482
Topic, potpourri.
Let's go!

137
00:06:26,551 --> 00:06:29,384
<i>Um, I'm sort of
a master of distraction.</i>

138
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:32,150
When I was a kid,
my mom received compliments

139
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:33,781
left and right
from my teachers

140
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:37,885
on how I was always able
to distract others in class.

141
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:42,157
Try to think, "What were
the first 13 colonies?"

142
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,466
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

143
00:06:54,712 --> 00:06:56,304
The purpose
for this meeting

144
00:06:56,381 --> 00:07:00,545
is to take Pam's mind off of
what's going on inside of her body.

145
00:07:00,618 --> 00:07:01,983
Can we do
sleight-of-hand tricks?

146
00:07:02,053 --> 00:07:03,145
I will allow that.

147
00:07:03,221 --> 00:07:05,985
Yes! Can anyone do those?

148
00:07:06,057 --> 00:07:07,922
I'm gonna go look
at the Internet.

149
00:07:11,429 --> 00:07:13,590
All right.
That's a good one.

150
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:14,859
Okay.

151
00:07:15,733 --> 00:07:16,995
Sorry, guys.
Just keep talking.

152
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,126
Okay.

153
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:22,799
Oh, God, Pam.
You are a woman warrior.

154
00:07:22,874 --> 00:07:24,432
Oh. Thanks, Kelly.

155
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:28,512
Does anybody have anything?
Anything interesting, any hobbies?

156
00:07:28,913 --> 00:07:30,005
Uh, special skills?

157
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:31,139
Yes, this is the only time

158
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:33,309
I'm ever going to make
this request. Yeah, Phyl.

159
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:35,944
Yeah. I can put on lipstick
the way Molly Ringwald does

160
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,851
<i>in The Breakfast Club.</i>

161
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,356
No, no. I don't think
anybody wants to see that.

162
00:07:40,425 --> 00:07:43,155
I can do the Evolution
of Dance dance.

163
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:46,488
That sounds good.
Do you need some music or...

164
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:48,498
No, actually, music
would just throw me off.

165
00:07:48,566 --> 00:07:51,160
Okay. I need complete silence, okay?

166
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:09,711
You're clapping.
I need complete silence.

167
00:08:10,321 --> 00:08:13,757
Totally threw me off, so
I'm gonna have to start over.

168
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,120
The Evolution
of Dance dance.

169
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:22,188
"You let me in your bed
But now I sleep alone

170
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:25,959
"Trapped with the forgotten
In my detritus home"

171
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:29,671
Affirmed, Seattle Slew,
Secretariat, Citation,

172
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:33,871
Assault, Count Fleet, Whirlaway,
War Admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox.

173
00:08:34,612 --> 00:08:36,477
And... I know this.

174
00:08:36,581 --> 00:08:40,244
Uh, the jockey was Johnny
Loftus, sired by Star Shoot.

175
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:45,547
Good afternoon.

176
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:46,681
Have a seat.

177
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:50,794
What is this?

178
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,159
Before we conceive a child,

179
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:55,131
it is important that we bang
out a parenting contract.

180
00:08:55,199 --> 00:08:56,530
Of course.

181
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:02,267
It's been a long time since
we've come down here separately.

182
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,329
You know, I was thinking...

183
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:04,534
Now then,
let's get to it, shall we?

184
00:09:04,609 --> 00:09:07,476
Ltem one. Child will be
breastfed by the mother

185
00:09:07,545 --> 00:09:08,671
for exactly six months,

186
00:09:08,746 --> 00:09:11,772
then weaned onto a nutrient-rich,
winter vegetable mash

187
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,282
provided by the father,
Dwight Schrute,

188
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,717
hereafter referred
to as Morpheus.

189
00:09:15,787 --> 00:09:17,482
Agreed?
Agreed.

190
00:09:18,656 --> 00:09:21,716
Where are we? We have every six
minutes, ladies and gentlemen.

191
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:25,820
Another 75 contractions and
you are going to be there.

192
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:28,991
For the love of God, Pam,
do it for ultra feast.

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,729
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna
go give Dr. Rezvani a quick call.

194
00:09:32,804 --> 00:09:33,862
He'll probably know...

195
00:09:33,938 --> 00:09:35,235
Jim, please,
happy thoughts here.

196
00:09:35,306 --> 00:09:37,001
Happy times. Yeah, happy times. Come on.

197
00:09:37,075 --> 00:09:38,303
Let's have happy times.
All right.

198
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:40,367
Jim, as a matter of fact,

199
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,078
I've printed out
10 ways to induce labor,

200
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:47,947
and I'm thinking we just do
the opposite of those things

201
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:49,486
and we can slow down
your labor.

202
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:50,612
Erin, read the first one.

203
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,212
"Stimulate the nipples."

204
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,882
Okay, nobody touch
Pam's nipples.

205
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:56,392
Think of Pam's nipples
as Toby's grundle.

206
00:09:56,461 --> 00:09:59,828
Her shirt is touching them. Maybe
we should cut holes in her shirt.

207
00:09:59,897 --> 00:10:01,194
I have a shirt
like that in my car.

208
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:03,756
Okay, yeah,
why don't you go get it?

209
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:06,030
Okay, uh, the second one
is "walk around."

210
00:10:06,104 --> 00:10:07,366
We're already doing
the opposite of that.

211
00:10:07,438 --> 00:10:10,134
Perfect. Okay, number three,
eat spicy foods.

212
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,675
Okay, the opposite of that.

213
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:13,438
Stick spicy food
up her butt.

214
00:10:13,511 --> 00:10:16,446
Nope. Nope.
Nope. Nope.

215
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:17,807
Come on. Let's go to the
hospital. PAM: Jim. Jim.

216
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:19,509
Pam, let's go to the hospital
now. Sweetie, I love you,

217
00:10:19,584 --> 00:10:21,848
but you're really distracting
me from my distractions. Mmm-hmm.

218
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:23,318
Okay, great.
Well, sorry.

219
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,548
Why don't you go
do some work?

220
00:10:24,622 --> 00:10:25,782
Great. I will do that.

221
00:10:25,857 --> 00:10:28,155
Sorry, Pam, I just feel a
little bit frazzled, and you know

222
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,353
how very rarely I use that word. I know.

223
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:31,622
"Frazzled." You
don't like to be frazzled.

224
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:33,095
No, I don't.
- Okay.

225
00:10:33,164 --> 00:10:38,067
Oh. And by the way, hate that you're
helping her with this right now. Totally.

226
00:10:39,303 --> 00:10:40,531
Someone's freaking.

227
00:10:40,605 --> 00:10:41,799
Getting a little frazzled.

228
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:42,999
Yeah, he is.

229
00:10:43,074 --> 00:10:45,008
<i>I know Pam better than
anyone in this office,</i>

230
00:10:45,076 --> 00:10:46,941
<i>and obviously
she's gone crazy,</i>

231
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,603
<i>but everybody wants
to say that I'm crazy.</i>

232
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:52,445
But I'm not crazy. She's crazy.
I'm not crazy. She's crazy.

233
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,681
"Five to seven minutes."

234
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:56,479
"Five to seven minutes."

235
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,114
"Six minutes."
Different, but not really.

236
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,281
"Five to seven minutes."

237
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,320
Acceptable names include,
and are limited to,

238
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,023
Ebenezer.
Jebediah.

239
00:11:07,098 --> 00:11:08,895
Honus.
Jedediah.

240
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,292
Worf.

241
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,795
<i>No Star Trek names.</i>

242
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:13,166
Okay. Fine.

243
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,295
What if it's a girl?

244
00:11:14,372 --> 00:11:15,896
Irrelevant question.

245
00:11:15,973 --> 00:11:18,407
Section 5A.
"Child shall be male."

246
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,603
Hey. Uh-uh.
I cannot control that.

247
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,305
You can't put that
in here. Yes, you can.

248
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,972
No. It's as simple as keeping the womb

249
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:26,380
extremely warm for
two days after sex,

250
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,749
and then extremely
cold for five months.

251
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,219
Absolutely not.

252
00:11:33,558 --> 00:11:34,889
Hey.
Hey.

253
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,119
Oh.

254
00:11:37,929 --> 00:11:39,157
I'm not gonna
get in the car,

255
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,391
'cause I know if I do, you'll
try to drive me to the hospital.

256
00:11:41,466 --> 00:11:42,660
Ah!

257
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:44,530
You know me too well.

258
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,097
Okay, Jim.
Yeah.

259
00:11:47,238 --> 00:11:48,432
Everything is fine.

260
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:49,564
Totally.
You don't have to worry.

261
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,701
Try not to think about it. She's
not coming out for a while, okay?

262
00:11:54,412 --> 00:11:56,073
Did you say "she"?

263
00:11:56,581 --> 00:12:00,039
I called the doctor, like,
a week ago. I couldn't wait.

264
00:12:02,186 --> 00:12:04,120
Oh, God, don't be mad.

265
00:12:04,188 --> 00:12:05,246
Mad?

266
00:12:07,191 --> 00:12:11,321
How could I be mad?
We're having a little girl.

267
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:13,588
Mmm-hmm.

268
00:12:13,664 --> 00:12:15,859
Wow. We're having
a little girl.

269
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:19,970
Man!
I know.

270
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:22,466
Whoo! All right.

271
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,437
Well, I definitely feel better. Good.

272
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,410
Yeah. All right.
Okay.

273
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:31,904
Hey, did you change?

274
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,814
Oh, yeah.
My water broke.

275
00:12:33,985 --> 00:12:35,509
Oh.

276
00:12:35,853 --> 00:12:37,047
Oh.

277
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:41,216
Oh! Whoa!

278
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,921
Pam? Pam!
Okay. All right.

279
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:48,493
Okay, it's time. Time to go to the
hospital. Somebody get Jim, please.

280
00:12:48,566 --> 00:12:50,431
Is it midnight yet?
No, it's 4:35.

281
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:53,436
4:35. All right. Almost
made it. Almost made it.

282
00:12:53,504 --> 00:12:56,564
Too bad you didn't have sex,
like, seven-and-a-half hours later.

283
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,609
But you had to have the
afternoon delight. I understand.

284
00:12:58,676 --> 00:12:59,836
Sometimes you
have to go for it.

285
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,378
Let's go to the hospital,
shall we?

286
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,037
No. Not yet, Michael.

287
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:04,138
We can do it.

288
00:13:04,215 --> 00:13:05,807
Oh, wow! It's almost
time for ultra feast.

289
00:13:05,883 --> 00:13:07,714
Where's Kevin?
What?

290
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,111
You want to eat cat food with
Kevin and not go to the hospital?

291
00:13:11,189 --> 00:13:14,124
That's Fancy Feast. Ultra
feast is something they made up

292
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:16,717
so they can pig out together
in the name of ceremony.

293
00:13:16,794 --> 00:13:18,022
What is October Feast?

294
00:13:18,095 --> 00:13:23,032
There is no rush to get to the
hospital. I'm fine. I'll get there.

295
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:27,504
And if I don't get there,
I don't get there.

296
00:13:30,508 --> 00:13:32,738
Our ultra feast
menu's theme,

297
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:35,175
Hollywood.

298
00:13:35,513 --> 00:13:38,073
<i>We have ratatouille
from Ratatouille,</i>

299
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,084
<i>and tandoori chicken
from Born Into Brothels.</i>

300
00:13:41,652 --> 00:13:45,748
<i>I tried to bake a cake like that
District 9 prawn thing, but I...</i>

301
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:48,358
Are you okay?

302
00:13:48,426 --> 00:13:49,688
Mmm.

303
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,955
Yes. I'm fine.

304
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,121
Are you sure?

305
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,428
Yeah, the doctor said that it's
still considered a minor contraction

306
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,127
as long as I can talk
through it.

307
00:13:58,202 --> 00:13:59,794
Okay. Okay. Jim?

308
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:01,899
I think this feast is
over... JIM: All right.

309
00:14:01,973 --> 00:14:03,497
...and it's time to go to
the hospital. Time to go.

310
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:04,632
No.
That's right.

311
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:05,733
Let's do this.
Let's give it a shot.

312
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:06,868
No, it's better.
- Here we go.

313
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:08,844
That wasn't even the worst of
them. I'm fine. JIM: Hey, come on.

314
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,437
They're not that bad still.
Let's go to the hospital.

315
00:14:10,514 --> 00:14:11,572
Pam. No, it's passing, it's fine.

316
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:13,344
Pam, it's time. Let's go to
the hospital. Let's go, Pam.

317
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,941
It's okay. Michael
says we should go now.

318
00:14:15,019 --> 00:14:16,418
Yeah, I think we should
head out. PAM: It's fine.

319
00:14:16,487 --> 00:14:18,182
Pam. You know what?
It passed. It's good.

320
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:19,746
Absolutely fine. Come
on. Let's go. We gotta go.

321
00:14:19,824 --> 00:14:21,291
Babe, I'm not going.
We need to go.

322
00:14:21,359 --> 00:14:22,883
It's fine. Hey, come on.
We really gotta go.

323
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,190
No. I'm not going!
I am not going, okay?

324
00:14:25,263 --> 00:14:26,287
All right.

325
00:14:26,364 --> 00:14:29,856
I'm not going today because I can't
do it! I don't think I can do it!

326
00:14:29,934 --> 00:14:32,300
Hey. Hey. Hey.

327
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,059
Are you kidding me?

328
00:14:34,138 --> 00:14:35,662
Are you kidding?

329
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,835
If anyone can do this,
you can do this.

330
00:14:37,908 --> 00:14:38,932
You can do this.

331
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,999
You can do this.

332
00:14:40,077 --> 00:14:41,442
Pam, I'm scared.

333
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:42,979
I'm real scared.
I'm scared, too.

334
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:44,207
I'm petrified.

335
00:14:44,282 --> 00:14:45,647
But the best news is,

336
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,342
we're gonna
have a baby today.

337
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:48,442
Yeah.

338
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,850
A really
awesome baby.

339
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,478
We're gonna have a baby.

340
00:14:51,555 --> 00:14:52,886
So let's have it
at the hospital.

341
00:14:52,957 --> 00:14:54,549
Let's do that.

342
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,616
How are we doing on
contractions? Two minutes apart.

343
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:58,685
Two minutes.
Oh, God.

344
00:14:59,764 --> 00:15:00,822
Oh, no.
I thought I told you...

345
00:15:00,898 --> 00:15:02,729
It's okay. No, I told
you to warn me at five minutes.

346
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,427
Jim, we waited too long. I know.

347
00:15:04,502 --> 00:15:06,663
We waited too long. Two
minutes doesn't do us any good.

348
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:08,728
What happened to four and
three? MICHAEL: We're okay, Jim.

349
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:11,604
Okay, Pamela, you know
what time it is?

350
00:15:11,776 --> 00:15:12,970
I don't want to
have my baby here.

351
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:14,375
You know...
You're not going to.

352
00:15:14,445 --> 00:15:16,106
You know where you're
going? The hospital.

353
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,045
Yes you are, and you know
what you're gonna have?

354
00:15:18,115 --> 00:15:19,139
A baby.
Yes.

355
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,013
We're going to the hospital
and we're gonna have a baby.

356
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,076
I got it! I got it!
Everybody, it's go time!

357
00:15:23,154 --> 00:15:25,122
Action station!
Stanley, man the phones!

358
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:26,918
Meredith, please
grab a bottle of water.

359
00:15:26,991 --> 00:15:28,083
Erin, call an ambulance,
please!

360
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,183
No, no, no.

361
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,693
Ambulances are
emergencies only.

362
00:15:30,761 --> 00:15:32,558
You call the ambulance,
I call the cops.

363
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,257
All right, we're driving ourselves,
actually. MICHAEL: No, Jim.

364
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:35,663
You are in no
condition to drive.

365
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:37,564
I will drive you.
Check. Got it.

366
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:39,227
All right, I have my
wallet. MICHAEL: Yes.

367
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:40,565
Go bag's in the car.
Go bag? Where's my go bag?

368
00:15:40,638 --> 00:15:41,764
Keys. I need my keys!
Where's my go bag?

369
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:42,897
There's nothing in it.

370
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:46,204
You are telling me now that there
is nothing in it! Okay, great.

371
00:15:46,277 --> 00:15:48,404
Should I bring a
dictionary to the hospital?

372
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,174
The hospital will
provide dictionaries.

373
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:51,236
Bring the thesaurus.

374
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,805
Did anyone check
how dilated she is?

375
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,646
This is ridiculous.
Dwight, get away.

376
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,584
No, no, no, Dwight, let
Jim do that, please. Okay?

377
00:15:56,654 --> 00:15:58,053
I didn't know we had
a tape measure.

378
00:15:58,122 --> 00:15:59,180
"We" don't.

379
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:02,157
Okay, I can't find my keys!
I cannot find my keys!

380
00:16:02,226 --> 00:16:03,659
Found them. They're here.
Here we go. Here we go.

381
00:16:03,728 --> 00:16:05,218
- Here we go!
- Good luck!

382
00:16:05,296 --> 00:16:06,490
- Good luck, Pam.
- Bye, Pam.

383
00:16:06,564 --> 00:16:08,464
Thank you! Wish me luck!

384
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,965
Have fun!

385
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:14,134
Hey, it's 5:00.

386
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,363
Here we go.
Here we go. On our way.

387
00:16:18,409 --> 00:16:19,433
Hold it.

388
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,637
Come on,
Stanley. Okay.

389
00:16:22,012 --> 00:16:23,570
We're going now.
No. One more.

390
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:26,616
Can I... No, no, no,
no! Out, out, out! Idiot!

391
00:16:26,717 --> 00:16:27,979
Dwight, what is
the traffic like?

392
00:16:28,052 --> 00:16:29,314
Doesn't matter.
I'll escort you!

393
00:16:29,387 --> 00:16:30,979
All right.

394
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:34,891
Let's go!
- Easy, Dwight.

395
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,256
Michael!
What?

396
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:42,856
Michael!
What?

397
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,034
This is where I saw
that deer last week.

398
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:47,263
Where?
Right over by that fence.

399
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:48,737
By the bushes?
Okay, Michael, focus!

400
00:16:48,806 --> 00:16:50,398
Okay, go, go, go!
Guys, come on!

401
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:51,736
Let's go!

402
00:16:54,044 --> 00:16:56,012
<i>I love
escorting people.</i>

403
00:16:56,147 --> 00:17:00,777
In fact, a few years back, I put an ad
in the paper starting an escort service.

404
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:06,084
Got a lot of responses. Mostly
creeps. Made a few friends.

405
00:17:07,158 --> 00:17:08,352
All right, here we go.
You're doing great.

406
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:09,620
Okay, just breathe.

407
00:17:09,693 --> 00:17:10,785
She'll be here soon.

408
00:17:10,861 --> 00:17:11,885
She? You found out?

409
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:14,692
Come on, guys.
I wanted to be surprised.

410
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,296
Michael!
Yeah?

411
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:18,096
Stop texting. Put your
phone away! Michael, come on!

412
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:19,431
I'm texting
about you, okay?

413
00:17:19,503 --> 00:17:20,800
Come on!

414
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,971
All right.

415
00:17:27,011 --> 00:17:28,376
Let's move!

416
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:32,106
<i>What? POLICE OFFICER: Pull over.</i>

417
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,514
You're kidding me!

418
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,676
<i>Pull over.</i>

419
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:42,453
<i>You're not allowed to
impersonate a police officer.</i>

420
00:17:42,526 --> 00:17:44,960
<i>Don't make this
difficult, Dwight.</i>

421
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,627
Wait! Wait, my iPod's not in here. Okay.

422
00:17:51,702 --> 00:17:52,760
It has the
birth song on it.

423
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,771
Okay, I know, but my
iPod is in the go bag.

424
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,204
We'll be fine. Jim, I
don't want the first thing

425
00:17:56,273 --> 00:17:57,900
<i>the baby hears to be
the 8 Mile soundtrack.</i>

426
00:17:57,975 --> 00:17:59,442
Okay, so what do you
want to do? I don't know.

427
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,670
Let's go by
the house and get it.

428
00:18:00,744 --> 00:18:02,473
It's only 20 minutes
past the hospital.

429
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,480
Pam, no. Are you nuts? We're
going to the hospital now.

430
00:18:04,548 --> 00:18:06,675
Guys, guys,
stop fighting. Come on.

431
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,810
Come on. Do you want your
kid to come out a lawyer?

432
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:11,047
Right?

433
00:18:11,922 --> 00:18:16,256
Okay, you know what? I am all
over this. Here we go. Ready?

434
00:18:18,762 --> 00:18:19,922
Dwight Schrute.

435
00:18:19,997 --> 00:18:21,089
Hello, Dwight.

436
00:18:21,398 --> 00:18:23,696
Pam left her iPod at her
house. I want you to swing by,

437
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:26,668
pick it up and bring it to the
hospital. We need it yesterday.

438
00:18:26,737 --> 00:18:28,602
<i>Then why didn't you ask me
to do it yesterday?</i>

439
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,640
<i>I kept IM-ing you
how bored I was.</i>

440
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:32,198
Okay.
Dwight!

441
00:18:33,043 --> 00:18:36,274
Go to my house, get my iPod. I
think it's on the kitchen table.

442
00:18:36,347 --> 00:18:38,212
Do not touch
anything else.

443
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:40,079
The key is under...
I don't need a key.

444
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:42,812
Okay, Dwight, but if you do need a
key, just listen, it's under the...

445
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,377
No, don't. Don't.
Don't tell me.

446
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,823
Dwight, just listen.
It's underneath...

447
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,093
Okay.
You all right?

448
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:54,992
Yeah.

449
00:18:55,065 --> 00:18:56,191
Do you have everything, guys?

450
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:58,664
Michael, just
go park the car.

451
00:18:58,736 --> 00:19:00,033
Okay. All right.

452
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:11,113
Sir! Dunder Mifflin. It's okay.

453
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:12,944
You can't park here.

454
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:16,918
I just did.

455
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:27,325
Pam's doing great. Uh,
she's 10 inches dilated now.

456
00:19:27,398 --> 00:19:29,593
Sorry, meters...
Centimeters.

457
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,795
And she's also fully effaced,
which I don't know what that is.

458
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:37,432
But no baby yet. It's only
been six... Nineteen hours.

459
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:39,509
And I was sent out
for some ice chips

460
00:19:39,577 --> 00:19:41,101
because I might have
passed out a little bit,

461
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:42,645
but these are very
refreshing, very...

462
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:45,011
Daddy?
She's ready to push.

463
00:19:45,082 --> 00:19:46,174
Okay!

464
00:19:51,355 --> 00:19:55,519
Where's my little niblet?
Halpert, room D1. All right.

465
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,758
Family only beyond
this point. Thank you.

466
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:01,629
Here we go.

467
00:20:05,502 --> 00:20:06,594
Doing great.
Push again!

468
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:07,728
Not yet.

469
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,136
No, don't push.
Pull! Pull!

470
00:20:09,206 --> 00:20:10,230
Why don't you get
some more ice chips?

471
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:11,365
No, Jim, stay!

472
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:12,670
Okay.
Really push this time, Pam.

473
00:20:12,743 --> 00:20:13,835
Okay.

474
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:26,453
Nope. Not yet.
Not yet. Not yet.

475
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,020
Gotta go wash my eyes.

476
00:20:30,294 --> 00:20:32,819
That kid's gonna
have a lot of hair.

477
00:20:35,165 --> 00:20:36,792
Have you guys seen her?
She hasn't popped yet.

478
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:41,304
What? Damn it! She was
supposed to come out yesterday.

479
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:43,973
I decided to
give Baby Halpert

480
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,373
the newspaper from
the day she was born.

481
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:49,569
This frame set
me back 55 bones.

482
00:20:49,647 --> 00:20:51,478
But she decided to
take her sweet time,

483
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:53,743
so now I have to switch it
with today's paper.

484
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,287
This is ridiculous.
We just can't wait here.

485
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,016
I think it's gonna
be any minute now.

486
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,615
But you don't know that. We could
be here another half an hour.

487
00:21:02,693 --> 00:21:04,661
Phyllis, what could
you possibly have to do?

488
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:06,719
I have an ice cream
cake in the car.

489
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:10,995
Oh, my God! Go! Go! Go!
Are you insane? All right.

490
00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:13,966
Guys? Hello?

491
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:15,767
You're doing
great. Just relax. Um...

492
00:21:16,774 --> 00:21:21,302
Sorry to be a bother, but if we could
have an ETA when this is gonna...

493
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:24,739
You're kind of
losing them.

494
00:21:26,784 --> 00:21:28,046
God!

495
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:30,143
Oh, my God.
Look at her.

496
00:21:31,221 --> 00:21:33,416
The baby,
she's so beautiful.

497
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:35,692
Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

498
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:42,525
Yeah, that's
right. It's a baby, see?

499
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:43,623
Sir.

500
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,566
Sir, you can't smoke that in here. Okay.

501
00:21:45,636 --> 00:21:47,536
Put it out.
All right.

502
00:21:48,072 --> 00:21:50,404
Can't smoke
anywhere these days.

503
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:53,636
She's incredible.

504
00:21:55,112 --> 00:21:56,773
You want to count her
fingers and toes again?

505
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:59,509
No, let's let her rest. I'm
sure there are still 12 of each.

506
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,675
Okay.

507
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:02,983
Guys, guys!

508
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,021
Her name is
Cecelia Marie Halpert.

509
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:06,113
Eleven pounds,
four...

510
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:09,091
She's seven pounds, two
ounces, 18 inches. Seven pounds.

511
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,353
Mother and daughter
are doing great.

512
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:18,697
Congratulations.
That's great.

513
00:22:18,769 --> 00:22:19,793
There.

514
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,894
Hey, Grandma's back.

515
00:22:21,472 --> 00:22:23,872
Well, it was an adventure and a
half trying to find the cafeteria,

516
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:26,273
but I have returned
with the coffee. Great.

517
00:22:26,343 --> 00:22:28,208
Thank God. I haven't had
caffeine in nine months.

518
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:30,041
- May I?
- Yes.

519
00:22:31,315 --> 00:22:32,839
Somebody has
a full diaper.

520
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,213
Oh. Let me get it.

521
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:37,454
<i>I am a diapering master.</i>

522
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:39,584
<i>I have done little else
in the past two months.</i>

523
00:22:39,656 --> 00:22:42,056
<i>There is nothing
I cannot diaper.</i>

524
00:22:42,426 --> 00:22:44,724
Go ahead. Try to think
of something. I dare you.

525
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:50,793
Where's
the baby? I want to see the baby.

526
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:52,562
Oh! Oh.

527
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:54,704
Helene, hi.

528
00:22:56,006 --> 00:22:59,032
Oh, my goodness. What
are the odds of this?

529
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,408
Congratulations
on being a grandma.

530
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:03,810
Hello, Michael.
Hello.

531
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,876
Oh. How are you?

532
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:07,075
I worry about you.

533
00:23:07,151 --> 00:23:09,619
You know, I think
it's time for me to go.

534
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:11,210
Oh. Okay.

535
00:23:12,756 --> 00:23:13,745
Love you.

536
00:23:13,824 --> 00:23:15,086
Love you as a friend.

537
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:17,216
Love you, Mom.

538
00:23:19,062 --> 00:23:20,654
Oh!

539
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,631
I want to hold the baby.

540
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:25,327
Okay, you just have to use
the hand sanitizer first.

541
00:23:25,402 --> 00:23:26,835
Oh, right.

542
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:31,670
Again. No pants.

543
00:23:31,742 --> 00:23:33,141
Oh. Okay.

544
00:23:33,477 --> 00:23:34,671
Ready?
Mmm-hmm.

545
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:44,148
Oh, wow.

546
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:48,090
Michael. Michael.

547
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:52,089
That's so weird. She was saying
it just before you got here.

548
00:23:55,866 --> 00:23:59,734
<i>Yesterday I was dispatched to
Jim and Pam's house to find Pam's iPod.</i>

549
00:23:59,803 --> 00:24:02,738
<i>I searched everywhere,
but I didn't find it.</i>

550
00:24:03,307 --> 00:24:07,710
<i>What I did find was mold,
and lots of it.</i>

551
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,910
<i>So, I did what
anyone would do.</i>

552
00:24:11,215 --> 00:24:14,207
<i>I read a book, had a bath,
I got a good night's sleep,</i>

553
00:24:14,284 --> 00:24:16,684
<i>and I made plans
to eradicate it.</i>

554
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:21,916
<i>I also made plans to ask Jim where
he bought his marvelous sheets.</i>

555
00:24:23,694 --> 00:24:25,457
Time to get to work.

556
00:24:31,535 --> 00:24:33,867
There she sat.
Her name was Pam.

557
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:37,504
She was a receptionist. She
was engaged to an animal.

558
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:42,373
There sat Jim. He was
a gawky, tall salesman.

559
00:24:43,347 --> 00:24:47,249
The odds of them getting
together were insurmountainable.

560
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:51,311
I made a family. I got these
two together and I made a family.

561
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:53,288
This man has a gift.

562
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,553
Who else here is single?

563
00:24:55,626 --> 00:24:57,321
I'm not single.
I have a man.

564
00:24:57,728 --> 00:24:59,889
I am offering up my
services to you all.

565
00:24:59,963 --> 00:25:02,431
You saw what I did with Pam
and Jim. I can help you, too.

566
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:04,126
Why don't you find
someone for yourself

567
00:25:04,201 --> 00:25:05,725
instead of meddling
in our affairs?

568
00:25:05,802 --> 00:25:08,100
Okay, show of hands. Who
wants to live in a world

569
00:25:08,171 --> 00:25:11,470
where Stanley has two lovers
and you don't have any?

570
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:15,174
Who else? Come on.
People, I know models.

571
00:25:15,512 --> 00:25:17,707
Plus-size
models, maybe.

572
00:25:18,882 --> 00:25:22,010
You got that right. Meredith?
Come on. You're obviously single.

573
00:25:22,085 --> 00:25:24,815
You know it. I am never getting married.

574
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:26,622
Like Clooney.

575
00:25:26,723 --> 00:25:28,020
Andrew? What about you?

576
00:25:28,125 --> 00:25:30,286
Torn scrotum.
Still on the mend, so...

577
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,725
Not good timing.

578
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:35,993
Yes, I'm gonna ask out Erin. I'm
just waiting for the stars to align.

579
00:25:36,066 --> 00:25:37,090
Literally.

580
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,862
I have a small
skylight in my bedroom,

581
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,995
and I'd like for
the moon to be visible.

582
00:25:41,071 --> 00:25:43,198
Well, when you least
expect it, expect it.

583
00:25:43,273 --> 00:25:47,903
I am going to fill the empty
voids in your life with love.

584
00:25:48,445 --> 00:25:51,812
I am going to fill
that empty hole

585
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,907
in your body
with another person.

586
00:25:54,785 --> 00:25:57,151
And like Cupid, I am going
to shoot you with love.

587
00:26:11,234 --> 00:26:14,965
Remember yesterday, when we
were terrified of being parents?

588
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,796
We were just kids.
What did we know?

589
00:26:17,874 --> 00:26:19,535
Hey, how we doing?

590
00:26:19,643 --> 00:26:20,871
Good.
Great.

591
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:23,276
Would you like me to take her
to the nursery for the night?

592
00:26:23,347 --> 00:26:25,281
Doesn't she sleep here?
She can.

593
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:26,873
But a lot of parents
choose to have the baby

594
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,247
spend the first
night in the nursery

595
00:26:28,318 --> 00:26:31,253
to get some rest.
You've been through a lot.

596
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:33,013
I think
we'll be okay.

597
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,216
Okay, great.

598
00:26:37,394 --> 00:26:38,622
Big yawn.

599
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:40,157
Ready, one, two, three.

600
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,061
One, and
then wrap around.

601
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:43,154
It's okay.

602
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,731
I don't understand.
Hold that arm down.

603
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:47,531
I can't. She's too strong.
Careful, though.

604
00:26:47,604 --> 00:26:48,730
You don't want
to break it.

605
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:50,966
She's not
going to... Just...

606
00:26:51,041 --> 00:26:52,975
I got it. All right.
- Go. Go.

607
00:26:53,043 --> 00:26:54,408
I'm done.
Nurse?

608
00:26:54,678 --> 00:26:55,940
How you doing?

609
00:26:56,013 --> 00:26:57,071
I don't know.

610
00:26:57,914 --> 00:27:00,314
I just... I can't tell
if she's getting anything.

611
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,408
Really?

612
00:27:01,485 --> 00:27:02,679
It doesn't feel right.

613
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:05,947
Well, you're pushing
the milk out, right?

614
00:27:06,023 --> 00:27:07,456
How would one do that?

615
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:11,559
Well, isn't it kind
of like... Like that?

616
00:27:11,628 --> 00:27:13,357
Do you want to try it, Jim? Mmm-mmm.

617
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:15,796
I think you're good.
Doing a good job.

618
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:21,161
Somebody buzzed?

619
00:27:21,238 --> 00:27:23,433
Oh, really?
Must have sat on it, Pam.

620
00:27:23,607 --> 00:27:25,074
I can't tell if
she's getting anything.

621
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:26,973
It just doesn't
really feel right.

622
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:28,978
Well, maybe we should take
a break for a little while.

623
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:30,070
I can take her
to the nursery

624
00:27:30,147 --> 00:27:31,774
and then bring her back and
try again a little bit later.

625
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:33,713
Even if she's not
getting anything?

626
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:34,842
Yeah, she'll be fine.

627
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:36,977
I can always give her a bottle
once we're in the nursery.

628
00:27:37,054 --> 00:27:39,682
No. I read in the book
about nipple confusion.

629
00:27:39,756 --> 00:27:41,519
Oh, good.
You know everything.

630
00:27:41,591 --> 00:27:44,424
I mean, she's just really
tentative about latching,

631
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:46,724
and I just want to
keep her self-esteem up.

632
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:49,425
I'll bring her back in a little
while and we can try again, okay?

633
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:51,364
All right.
All right.

634
00:27:54,905 --> 00:27:56,031
It's gonna be all right.

635
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,334
Yeah, maybe it'll
be good 'cause then

636
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,102
she can, like, socialize
with the other babies.

637
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:03,573
No, yeah,
that would be good.

638
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:05,572
You wanted to see me?

639
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:06,946
What would you say

640
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:10,214
if I told you that I was
about to change your life?

641
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:11,515
Oh, boy!

642
00:28:13,223 --> 00:28:14,884
What's that sound?

643
00:28:16,026 --> 00:28:17,254
Ta-da!

644
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:19,295
I would like you to meet
your new boyfriend.

645
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:20,420
Yes.

646
00:28:21,364 --> 00:28:22,422
I don't know
what to say.

647
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:25,491
Say nothing. You will learn to love me.

648
00:28:25,702 --> 00:28:27,192
Okay, hold on.

649
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:28,601
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

650
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,401
You got to let
the cookies cool

651
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:32,840
before you pop them in your mouth. Okay.

652
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:36,401
Why don't you guys get to know each
other, maybe have lunch together?

653
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,846
Erin, would you
have lunch with me?

654
00:28:38,915 --> 00:28:39,973
Okay.

655
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:41,415
Good.
Yes!

656
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,677
Michael, can I talk
to you privately?

657
00:28:43,753 --> 00:28:45,948
Sure. Kevin, please leave.

658
00:28:46,022 --> 00:28:47,819
Bye.
- Bye.

659
00:28:51,461 --> 00:28:53,292
I'm so sorry if I
gave you the impression

660
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:56,059
that I'm into Kevin,
but I'm not. I like Andy.

661
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,465
Okay.
This is going to kill Kevin.

662
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,627
I'm sure he'll be fine.

663
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:01,330
I'm not so sure.

664
00:29:01,538 --> 00:29:03,665
Kevin has an
enormous heart.

665
00:29:04,107 --> 00:29:05,836
Literally, he has
an elephant heart.

666
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:08,503
He had a transplant
when he was 17.

667
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,544
Had some problems... Really?

668
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:16,208
No. Kevin doesn't have an elephant
heart, but he is very sensitive,

669
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:19,549
and it won't kill Erin to just go and
have lunch with him in the break room,

670
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:21,386
like I promised him.

671
00:29:23,793 --> 00:29:26,318
I bet his heart
is enlarged, though.

672
00:29:26,396 --> 00:29:27,693
I don't want
anyone to die.

673
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:30,130
Just don't let
him sit on you.

674
00:29:31,434 --> 00:29:32,696
I'm kidding.
You'll have fun.

675
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:35,829
It'll be good. It'll
be good. There he is.

676
00:29:35,939 --> 00:29:37,270
Go to him.

677
00:29:37,974 --> 00:29:39,202
Hi.
Hi.

678
00:29:42,145 --> 00:29:44,113
Nice. She touched
my shoulder.

679
00:29:47,317 --> 00:29:50,616
Hey, guys. We're short on
rooms, so this is Dale and Kathy.

680
00:29:50,687 --> 00:29:51,813
Oh.

681
00:29:52,789 --> 00:29:53,915
Hi.
Hi.

682
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:55,787
Sorry.
Hi. So sorry.

683
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:57,354
Careful.

684
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,027
Wow, she just shoves
the nipple right in there.

685
00:30:05,101 --> 00:30:06,295
I know.

686
00:30:07,037 --> 00:30:09,870
Did you see that?
I'm pretty sure she's...

687
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,066
Hey.

688
00:30:21,418 --> 00:30:22,942
Did you grow up
around here?

689
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:24,979
No.

690
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,955
So, you must have grown up
around somewhere else?

691
00:30:31,127 --> 00:30:32,185
Yes.

692
00:30:37,467 --> 00:30:39,332
Why was I hiding
behind the plant?

693
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:41,700
Well, in college
I took a botany class,

694
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:44,763
and there was lots of
drama in that class. Uh...

695
00:30:44,841 --> 00:30:48,368
Kids would gossip about me,
so I would eavesdrop on them

696
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:52,181
by hiding behind different
plants in the botany class.

697
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:55,077
And then they
would say things like,

698
00:30:55,151 --> 00:30:56,778
"Oh, this guy's gonna
fail this class,"

699
00:30:56,853 --> 00:31:00,914
or, "What's this guy doing
spying on us from behind plants?"

700
00:31:00,991 --> 00:31:02,583
And then I would
jump out at them

701
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:04,957
and confront them
and be like,

702
00:31:05,028 --> 00:31:09,294
"You think all I do is hide behind
plants and spy on people? Busted."

703
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,831
Oh. The reason?

704
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:14,361
The reason I was hiding behind
that plant in this situation

705
00:31:14,437 --> 00:31:18,430
was that I thought that Erin and
Kevin were kind of hitting it off,

706
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,305
and I was jealous.

707
00:31:23,246 --> 00:31:24,873
Uh, hi. Pam Halpert?

708
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:25,972
Yes.

709
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:27,914
Hi, I'm Clarke.

710
00:31:27,984 --> 00:31:31,545
Josie said you might benefit
from a lactation consultant.

711
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:33,046
Yep.

712
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:34,454
Um, yeah,
that would be great.

713
00:31:34,524 --> 00:31:36,549
Really great.
When's she available?

714
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:38,651
Actually, I'm the consultant.

715
00:31:39,496 --> 00:31:41,361
Got milk?

716
00:31:41,431 --> 00:31:43,626
All right, let's see
what we're working with.

717
00:31:48,338 --> 00:31:51,705
So, the biggest thing besides not
being able to get her to latch...

718
00:31:51,775 --> 00:31:53,436
I'll get that for you.
Oh, thank you.

719
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:56,343
...is that I can't tell
if I'm really producing.

720
00:31:56,413 --> 00:31:58,108
I don't know if she's
getting anything.

721
00:31:58,181 --> 00:31:59,671
Let me feel here.
Okay.

722
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:01,114
Yeah,
it's quite full.

723
00:32:01,184 --> 00:32:02,208
Why don't you put your
hand on top of my hand?

724
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:04,253
Okay. When you're feeding you want

725
00:32:04,321 --> 00:32:07,722
to press in like this, make
your hand in a C. Does that hurt?

726
00:32:07,791 --> 00:32:10,385
No, it feels pressure.
Okay.

727
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,553
You sure it doesn't hurt? No.

728
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:13,755
It just feels like pressure.

729
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,730
Feel how I'm flicking
the nipple? PAM: Mmm-hmm.

730
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:17,198
Like that? It's stimulated. Mmm-hmm.

731
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:18,427
Yep. Yep.
- Mmm-hmm.

732
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:21,367
So you just want
to do that and that will...

733
00:32:21,438 --> 00:32:22,530
Perfect.

734
00:32:22,739 --> 00:32:23,865
The baby
should grab onto that.

735
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:24,998
I think she will.

736
00:32:25,075 --> 00:32:27,908
I'm just not sure if I'm releasing,
though. I'm not sure if...

737
00:32:27,977 --> 00:32:29,376
We'll figure it out,
probably. CLARKE: It doesn't...

738
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:30,913
Why don't you bring
your baby over here?

739
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,538
Okay.

740
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:33,906
She's beautiful. Yes.

741
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,314
Oh, thank you.

742
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:37,414
Congratulations.
Thank you.

743
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:39,114
Well, you're doing a good
job. Just stay relaxed

744
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:41,851
and I'll come back in a
bit to check on you. Okay?

745
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:43,552
Okay.
Please do.

746
00:32:45,795 --> 00:32:48,423
Oh, shoot. Shoot,
she fell off.

747
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:50,096
Oh. Uh...

748
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,565
Try the torpedo thing.

749
00:32:51,634 --> 00:32:53,158
Will you just grab
Clarke real quick?

750
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:55,727
No need. I saw him
do it. I can try it.

751
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,172
Jim, please, please, please. I think
it would be weird if you did it.

752
00:32:59,242 --> 00:33:02,405
That makes sense. I'll
just go get the other guy.

753
00:33:04,447 --> 00:33:05,846
<i>Hey, what's up, kid?</i>

754
00:33:05,915 --> 00:33:10,011
Have you had a chance to look over the
revisions on the contract I prepared for you?

755
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:13,920
Nothing left to do except dot
the I's, the J's and the umlauts.

756
00:33:14,524 --> 00:33:18,221
Why don't you meet me here
at exactly mid-late afternoon?

757
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:20,489
I look forward to it.

758
00:33:20,563 --> 00:33:21,689
Very well.

759
00:33:21,965 --> 00:33:23,193
Goodbye.

760
00:33:29,406 --> 00:33:31,033
Jim. Jim, get her.

761
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,233
Hmm?

762
00:33:32,308 --> 00:33:34,742
Get the baby.
Get her, come on.

763
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:40,074
Okay.
I know, I know.

764
00:33:46,723 --> 00:33:48,384
Okay. Come here.

765
00:33:51,494 --> 00:33:53,359
All right.
I got her.

766
00:33:57,267 --> 00:34:02,364
Okay. Okay. Okay.

767
00:34:05,775 --> 00:34:08,403
Jim. She latched.
She latched!

768
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:09,536
That's amazing.

769
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:12,274
Oh, my God. I didn't even
have to do the C thing.

770
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:13,679
That's awesome.

771
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,741
Oh! We're doing it.

772
00:34:15,885 --> 00:34:17,011
That's great.

773
00:34:17,086 --> 00:34:18,713
We're really parents now.

774
00:34:19,923 --> 00:34:22,858
Kevin, Erin would like
a few words with you.

775
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,353
Hey.
Hi.

776
00:34:24,427 --> 00:34:25,758
I've really enjoyed
our time together.

777
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,057
Yeah. Me, too.

778
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:28,529
I want to continue
working on our friendship...

779
00:34:28,598 --> 00:34:29,792
It was really, really fun.

780
00:34:29,866 --> 00:34:31,959
...'cause I think our friendship
could be a really cool thing.

781
00:34:32,035 --> 00:34:33,229
Yeah. Me, too.

782
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:34,895
And you're my friend.

783
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:37,170
Yeah. I hope that I'm your friend.

784
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,332
Yeah.
And...

785
00:34:38,408 --> 00:34:39,807
Oh, my God.
This is agonizing.

786
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:44,540
Look, Kevin, do you really think
that you could have dated Erin?

787
00:34:44,881 --> 00:34:46,746
You said she liked me.

788
00:34:46,883 --> 00:34:49,784
Okay, even if someone told
you that, you should know

789
00:34:49,853 --> 00:34:52,651
that that could
never be possible, Kevin.

790
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,856
And I'm surprised that you didn't
question me in the first place.

791
00:34:55,925 --> 00:34:57,222
I've done better
than Erin.

792
00:34:57,293 --> 00:34:58,317
No, you haven't.

793
00:34:58,394 --> 00:35:00,157
Lynn was way hotter
than Erin, Michael.

794
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:02,698
Lynn was as hot as Erin.

795
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:06,663
Yeah, Michael, but
you dated Holly and Jan

796
00:35:06,736 --> 00:35:08,636
and they were so
much hotter than you.

797
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:11,071
This isn't about me,
and that is debatable,

798
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:14,234
and I have a personality,
whereas you...

799
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:15,641
Yes, Andy?

800
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:23,310
Kev.

801
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:26,546
Nice going.

802
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,125
Knock-knock.

803
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,429
Oh, hey, Isabel.

804
00:35:34,497 --> 00:35:35,589
Oh, hey.

805
00:35:36,966 --> 00:35:39,764
Pam, she's gorgeous.
Can I hold her?

806
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:40,894
Yes.

807
00:35:41,137 --> 00:35:42,434
She was a little
fussy earlier,

808
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:44,530
but she's totally
quieted down.

809
00:35:44,607 --> 00:35:48,475
Here. Let me just burp her. I
don't want her to spit up on you.

810
00:35:48,545 --> 00:35:50,445
Look at you.
Come here, sweetie.

811
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,476
Oh, my God.
- What?

812
00:35:55,118 --> 00:35:56,710
Wrong baby.
What?

813
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:58,981
Wrong baby.
This is not our baby!

814
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:00,147
Oh, my God.

815
00:36:18,341 --> 00:36:19,569
Oh.

816
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,511
Has she been
fussing long?

817
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:27,607
No. Not at all.
Perfect.

818
00:36:28,351 --> 00:36:30,478
I was out like a light. Hey!

819
00:36:34,924 --> 00:36:36,551
She's not hungry.

820
00:36:46,002 --> 00:36:47,663
How's it going?
Well,

821
00:36:47,737 --> 00:36:50,399
I feel like she needs to eat,
but she just won't latch on,

822
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:51,963
which is weird,
because the other baby...

823
00:36:54,043 --> 00:36:57,570
Bottles are fine. A lot of
babies grow up using bottles.

824
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,079
So, you excited to
take your baby home?

825
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:01,548
We definitely are.
At 3:00, right?

826
00:37:01,618 --> 00:37:02,710
You said we could
stay until 3:00?

827
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,309
Yeah. You can.

828
00:37:04,387 --> 00:37:06,252
It's 2:35.
Half hour.

829
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:08,016
Well, 25 minutes.

830
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,550
And you're all set
with the car seat?

831
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,594
Yes. Car seat's
right there.

832
00:37:11,661 --> 00:37:13,253
That bottom part
needs to go in the car.

833
00:37:13,329 --> 00:37:15,229
Newsflash, the whole thing
needs to go in the car.

834
00:37:17,233 --> 00:37:18,461
Be back in 25 minutes.

835
00:37:18,534 --> 00:37:20,900
Or it can be a half hour,
if you need it to be.

836
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,063
Can we get
a late checkout?

837
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,232
I don't think
she heard me.

838
00:37:26,943 --> 00:37:28,103
Hello?

839
00:37:30,213 --> 00:37:33,148
Dwight? What...
What are you doing here?

840
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,840
Isabel, hello.

841
00:37:37,587 --> 00:37:40,556
Yeah, the kitchen
was disgusting, so...

842
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:41,715
Wow.

843
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:43,515
New cabinets.
Yeah.

844
00:37:43,593 --> 00:37:44,958
All I did was bring
macaroni and cheese.

845
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:47,924
Where's the fridge?

846
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:50,659
Oh, it's in the backyard.
I'll take this.

847
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:54,327
Well, I'll let you
get back to it.

848
00:37:54,404 --> 00:37:56,599
Hey, listen, I know that I'm an adult,

849
00:37:56,673 --> 00:37:59,471
but maybe I could come by
sometime for a teeth cleaning?

850
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,442
You know, just for fun.

851
00:38:01,878 --> 00:38:05,041
Well, adults are supposed
to go to the dentist, too.

852
00:38:05,114 --> 00:38:09,881
Are they, now? How some
people spend their money, right?

853
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,515
Yeah.
All right.

854
00:38:13,656 --> 00:38:15,214
I'll call you, kid.

855
00:38:15,291 --> 00:38:16,383
Do that.

856
00:38:20,463 --> 00:38:21,725
You really sure
we should be leaving?

857
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:22,856
Yeah.

858
00:38:22,932 --> 00:38:25,457
But you hear the baby
crying, right? Mmm-hmm.

859
00:38:29,472 --> 00:38:30,564
Where's your car?

860
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,732
It's in the lot.

861
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:34,436
A lot of fathers
bring the car around.

862
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:40,081
Right. Okay. Yes. That
would be a smart thing to do.

863
00:38:40,483 --> 00:38:41,814
Uh, Pam,
I will be right back.

864
00:38:41,884 --> 00:38:43,647
Okay, please hurry.

865
00:38:44,187 --> 00:38:48,180
Erin, I need you to send
this fax immediately.

866
00:38:48,691 --> 00:38:50,056
It's really important,
so I'm gonna stand here

867
00:38:50,126 --> 00:38:51,252
and wait for
the confirmation.

868
00:38:51,327 --> 00:38:53,056
Okay. Good.

869
00:38:54,864 --> 00:39:00,234
The fax says, "Erin, will you
have dinner with me? From, Andy."

870
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:03,033
And the number is
our office fax number.

871
00:39:03,806 --> 00:39:05,603
It's
busy. Why don't I keep trying

872
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:06,869
and then I'll give you
the confirmation in a bit?

873
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:09,909
Sorry.
That's unacceptable.

874
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:13,540
I need you to send it
immediately or you're fired.

875
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:19,247
You can't talk to me like that.
I didn't do anything wrong.

876
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:21,849
I've been
having a tough day.

877
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:23,084
Oh, God, no.

878
00:39:24,026 --> 00:39:25,220
Um...

879
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:27,259
Just read the fax.

880
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:28,558
You read the fax.

881
00:39:30,767 --> 00:39:32,496
I'm asking you out.

882
00:39:34,403 --> 00:39:37,531
Oh, my God.
That's amazing!

883
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:44,270
Let me just fax this
and I'll check my planner.

884
00:39:45,114 --> 00:39:46,979
So, it's a date?
Yes!

885
00:39:47,316 --> 00:39:48,749
Do you have
a day in mind?

886
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:50,308
Yeah, what day?
What day?

887
00:39:50,386 --> 00:39:51,853
Every day is fine.

888
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:53,149
What's that one?

889
00:39:53,322 --> 00:39:55,256
Thursday?
Okay. Let's do it.

890
00:39:55,324 --> 00:39:56,723
We... Okay!

891
00:39:57,059 --> 00:40:00,256
Would you like me to help
you up out of the chair?

892
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:02,163
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

893
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:03,721
We've just got a lot
of discharges today.

894
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,030
Okay. Okay.

895
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:07,126
Thanks.

896
00:40:07,203 --> 00:40:08,261
All right, thanks.

897
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:09,429
All right.

898
00:40:15,578 --> 00:40:20,743
Hey. You want to eat?
You want to try eating?

899
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:24,478
Okay.

900
00:40:27,423 --> 00:40:29,015
Okay. Come here.

901
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:33,919
Just you and me.
Just you and me. Come on.

902
00:40:35,198 --> 00:40:36,597
There we go.

903
00:40:38,734 --> 00:40:41,931
Yeah. Oh, yeah!

904
00:40:43,306 --> 00:40:46,639
Like that. Oh.
There we go.

905
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,936
You got it.

906
00:40:49,011 --> 00:40:50,740
Five tickets on
the windshield.

907
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,079
Hey.
Hi.

908
00:40:57,653 --> 00:40:58,984
We did it.

909
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:02,815
You used my move,
didn't you?

910
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:04,883
I used a variation
of your move.

911
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:08,326
<i>There is no
greater feeling</i>

912
00:41:09,465 --> 00:41:11,592
than when two people who
are perfect for each other

913
00:41:11,667 --> 00:41:14,568
overcome all obstacles
and find true love.

914
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:19,672
And that's what I thought that Erin
and Kevin were going to find today.

915
00:41:23,713 --> 00:41:25,908
I think I'm going
to be sick.

916
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,922
Two forms of ID, please.

917
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:39,854
And now you.
Two forms of ID, please.

918
00:41:45,201 --> 00:41:48,762
All right, all is in order.
I just need your signature.

919
00:41:52,708 --> 00:41:54,073
What is it?

920
00:41:57,513 --> 00:41:58,741
Nothing.

921
00:42:02,251 --> 00:42:05,152
All right. How would
you like to celebrate?

922
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:11,457
Just pour yourself a cup
of apple juice. I feel sick.

923
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,757
What?

924
00:42:15,831 --> 00:42:16,957
I couldn't find your iPod.

925
00:42:22,538 --> 00:42:26,474
Give me a couple days.
Be out of your hair.
