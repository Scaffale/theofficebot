1
00:00:02,769 --> 00:00:04,669
- Pam?
- Yeah?

2
00:00:04,789 --> 00:00:06,456
Did you see Oprah yesterday?

3
00:00:06,458 --> 00:00:08,091
No, I didn't.

4
00:00:08,093 --> 00:00:10,560
I, uh...

5
00:00:10,562 --> 00:00:12,595
I am going to be a father.

6
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,465
What was Oprah about?

7
00:00:15,467 --> 00:00:17,934
Angelina Jolie was on.

8
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:19,836
And she adopted a baby from Asia

9
00:00:19,838 --> 00:00:21,871
and she said that
it changed her life.

10
00:00:21,873 --> 00:00:24,273
And that really inspired me.

11
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,776
So I want you to look in
to see how much

12
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:30,079
a little Chinese baby
would cost.

13
00:00:30,081 --> 00:00:32,882
That's a really big decision.

14
00:00:32,884 --> 00:00:35,151
I know.

15
00:00:35,153 --> 00:00:36,853
Maybe you should wait
before you adopt.

16
00:00:36,855 --> 00:00:38,388
Or not adopt.

17
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,757
Just do it, okay?

18
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:42,658
Roy's sister looked into it.

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,861
And the application alone
costs $1,000.

20
00:00:47,097 --> 00:00:48,631
Um...

21
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,467
Find out if there's a cheaper...

22
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:53,970
Less expensive baby
out there, okay?

23
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,005
You know... she also said
the waiting list

24
00:00:56,007 --> 00:00:57,106
is like eight months.

25
00:00:57,108 --> 00:00:58,741
- Eight months?
- Yeah.

26
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,176
I don't even know if I want
a baby in eight months.

27
00:01:00,178 --> 00:01:01,644
Probably won't.

28
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,684
You know, Pam,
if in ten years...

29
00:01:08,686 --> 00:01:10,086
I haven't had a baby,

30
00:01:10,088 --> 00:01:11,454
and you haven't had a baby...

31
00:01:11,456 --> 00:01:12,588
No, Michael.

32
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:15,491
- 20 years.
- No, Michael.

33
00:01:15,493 --> 00:01:17,059
30.

34
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:20,363
Sure.

35
00:01:21,698 --> 00:01:23,866
It's a deal.

36
00:01:55,766 --> 00:01:56,866
All right, three pairs of pants.

37
00:01:56,868 --> 00:01:57,867
Mm-hmm.

38
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,335
- Three pairs of socks.
- Mm-hmm.

39
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:01,204
Three packs of condoms.

40
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:03,306
Yeeeash.

41
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,607
Uh, fun jeans.

42
00:02:07,945 --> 00:02:08,978
Ah.

43
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,314
Sign.
Per diem.

44
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,683
Guess where I am going?

45
00:02:13,685 --> 00:02:14,984
I will give you a hint.

46
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,419
It is a booze-fueled
sex romp

47
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:17,453
where anything goes.

48
00:02:17,455 --> 00:02:19,322
You are correct sir!

49
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:21,524
I am headed to Philadelphia
for the annual

50
00:02:21,526 --> 00:02:24,660
Northeastern Mid-market
Office Supply Convention.

51
00:02:24,662 --> 00:02:26,762
And Jim Halpert
is going to be coming,

52
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,498
which will be fun.

53
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:31,267
Poor little guy has been stuck

54
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,469
working under Josh.

55
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:35,505
The poor man's Michael Scott,

56
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:37,540
as he is known around my condo.

57
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,244
Don't be mad.
It is a business trip.

58
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:44,247
But I don't understand.
It's for managers.

59
00:02:44,249 --> 00:02:46,048
Monkey, I am an ARM.

60
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,149
Assistant Regional Manager.

61
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,951
I know.

62
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:51,687
I was just really hoping
we could

63
00:02:51,689 --> 00:02:53,356
spend some time together.

64
00:02:57,461 --> 00:02:59,028
Are you still there?
Yes, Monkey.

65
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,863
Don't monkey me.

66
00:03:00,865 --> 00:03:04,500
You can't wait
to get out of here, ARM.

67
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:07,203
In the Martin family,
we like to say...

68
00:03:07,205 --> 00:03:08,738
looks like someone
took the slow train

69
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,473
from Philly.

70
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:14,544
That's code for
"Check out the slut."

71
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:17,079
What is...

72
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:18,214
Why are there flies in here?

73
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:19,615
Oh, my God!

74
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:21,217
Are you so excited for tonight?

75
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:22,451
I'm so excited... you guys
are gonna click.

76
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:23,653
I can feel it.

77
00:03:23,655 --> 00:03:24,954
So what are you wearing?

78
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:26,589
This.

79
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,994
You look so pretty.

80
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:35,631
Thank you.

81
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,300
Yes, I have a date.

82
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:40,102
He's a cartoonist
for the local paper.

83
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:41,237
Which is really neat,

84
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,974
because I like to draw too.

85
00:03:44,976 --> 00:03:47,209
I'm kind of nervous.

86
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:48,778
I haven't been on a first date

87
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,648
in nine years.

88
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:56,319
Probably shouldn't
broadcast that.

89
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,853
Well, remember, no matter
how much you may want to,

90
00:03:57,855 --> 00:03:59,255
do not sleep with him
on the first date.

91
00:03:59,257 --> 00:04:01,424
It gives him all the power.

92
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:02,425
Sleep with who?

93
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,493
Whom.
Whom?

94
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,494
My neighbor Allen.

95
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,529
They're going on a date tonight.

96
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,697
Oh, wow.

97
00:04:07,699 --> 00:04:09,665
Oh, my God.
I have a great idea.

98
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,300
You know what you should do?
Be hilarious?

99
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:13,069
Wear your wedding dress.

100
00:04:13,071 --> 00:04:16,238
That would be
a great icebreaker.

101
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,440
And your veil.
Yeah.

102
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:18,874
Do it.

103
00:04:18,876 --> 00:04:19,875
I'll probably just wear this.

104
00:04:19,877 --> 00:04:21,744
Really?
Okay.

105
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:22,912
Well, a word of advice,

106
00:04:22,914 --> 00:04:24,413
unbutton that top button.

107
00:04:24,415 --> 00:04:25,881
Let those things breathe.

108
00:04:25,883 --> 00:04:27,750
Any message you want me
to relate to Jim?

109
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:29,652
Um...

110
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:31,487
Um.
Okay, um.

111
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:32,555
- Um.
- You got that?

112
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:33,556
I got it.
Write it down.

113
00:04:33,558 --> 00:04:35,358
Um.
Um...

114
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:45,101
There's my girl.

115
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,737
I noticed you
handing out some shekels.

116
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:49,605
How would one get on that train?

117
00:04:49,607 --> 00:04:51,340
That was per diem
for Philadelphia.

118
00:04:51,342 --> 00:04:53,476
Ugh, that town
smells like cheese steaks.

119
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:56,078
That town is full of history.

120
00:04:59,249 --> 00:05:01,217
Andrea's the office bitch.

121
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,686
You'll get used to her.

122
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:06,389
Mmm.

123
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:09,959
Creed.

124
00:05:12,529 --> 00:05:15,264
Can I have my neck pillow back?

125
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,233
Michael!

126
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:19,869
Can I have my neck pillow back?

127
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,106
Hey, Michael.

128
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,107
Hey, Josh, how you doing?

129
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:26,142
Pretty good.
How you doing?

130
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:27,543
Great to see you.
There he is.

131
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,544
There's the traitor.

132
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:29,578
Traitor!
Traitor!

133
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,614
Come here, you.
Come here!

134
00:05:31,616 --> 00:05:33,949
Aaagh!

135
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:36,452
The product... the progidal...

136
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:38,888
My son returns.

137
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:39,955
I was shocked when he told me

138
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:41,123
he was transferring to Stamford.

139
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:42,491
It's like with firemen.

140
00:05:42,493 --> 00:05:44,994
You don't leave
your brothers behind.

141
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,730
Even if you find out
that there is

142
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:50,666
a better fire in Connecticut.

143
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:52,668
Really good to see you, man.

144
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:55,671
Yeah.
Wow.

145
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:56,772
I didn't expect that.

146
00:05:56,774 --> 00:06:00,342
It's good to see you too.

147
00:06:00,344 --> 00:06:03,279
Oh, hey.
How's it going up there?

148
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,147
Have you made any sales yet?

149
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:06,515
Yeah, sold about 40,000.

150
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,551
Shut up.
That's impossible.

151
00:06:08,553 --> 00:06:09,752
No, it's not.
And I did.

152
00:06:09,754 --> 00:06:10,786
Yeah.

153
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,155
Well, I did it too.

154
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,491
You know, when I saw Dwight,

155
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:17,727
I realized how stupid and petty

156
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,130
all those pranks
I pulled on him were.

157
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,599
And then he spoke.

158
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:25,401
I wonder how hard it would be
to get a copy

159
00:06:25,403 --> 00:06:26,469
of his room key.

160
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:28,204
So did you hear?

161
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,238
What?

162
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,773
Pam's back on the market again.

163
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:31,807
Really?
She's dating?

164
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:34,143
Oh, if I weren't engaged,

165
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,879
I would so hit that.

166
00:06:40,117 --> 00:06:42,785
So what kind of commissions
you get up there?

167
00:06:42,787 --> 00:06:46,155
Oh, Dwight,
I missed you so much.

168
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:47,923
You're so immature.

169
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:51,761
Listen, Michael, I heard you
were a great salesman.

170
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:53,229
And I just wanna let you know

171
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,930
that if our branch
absorbs your branch,

172
00:06:54,932 --> 00:06:57,299
I'm gonna look for a place
for you in Stamford.

173
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:58,300
Oh, hey!

174
00:06:58,302 --> 00:06:59,301
Hey, Jan.

175
00:06:59,303 --> 00:07:00,369
We all checked in?

176
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:01,537
Yes.
Great.

177
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,105
Let's dump our stuff
and meet back

178
00:07:03,107 --> 00:07:04,140
down here in a half an hour.

179
00:07:04,142 --> 00:07:05,207
Okay.

180
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,143
Jan?

181
00:07:07,145 --> 00:07:08,778
Look, I think we need
to set some ground rules.

182
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,513
What are you talking about?

183
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:13,082
The 800-pound gorilla
in the room.

184
00:07:13,084 --> 00:07:15,518
Carol.
I'm still dating her.

185
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,753
So nothing can happen between us

186
00:07:17,755 --> 00:07:19,021
at the convention.

187
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,422
Step away from me, Michael.

188
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:24,593
Thank you for being
so brave with all of this.

189
00:07:24,595 --> 00:07:26,729
Thank you.

190
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:34,537
Allen's cartoon
is so funny, right?

191
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,538
Mm-hmm.

192
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,139
And they're, like, so smart.

193
00:07:37,141 --> 00:07:41,510
I don't even know
what they mean half the time.

194
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:00,229
That is specifically why I chose

195
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,233
a room close to the elevator.
More foot traffic.

196
00:08:04,235 --> 00:08:05,968
Check it out.

197
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,470
That is crooked on that side.

198
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:09,705
Wow.

199
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,874
Hey hey!

200
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:12,975
That is a lot of liquor.

201
00:08:12,977 --> 00:08:13,976
Yeah.

202
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:15,311
And a dart board.

203
00:08:15,313 --> 00:08:16,412
Well, that's how
we do it in Scranton.

204
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:18,447
Or did you forget?

205
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:27,456
We should probably
head on down, you know,

206
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:28,457
hook up with Jan.

207
00:08:28,459 --> 00:08:29,458
Well, we have time.

208
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,594
One for the road, gentlemen?

209
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,395
A shot of Midori, perhaps.

210
00:08:38,869 --> 00:08:40,102
Oh, no, sorry,
it's an inside joke.

211
00:08:40,104 --> 00:08:43,539
There was this bartender
in Stamford who...

212
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,174
You know what?
You just have to be there.

213
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,276
Wish I was.

214
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,410
I love inside jokes.

215
00:08:48,412 --> 00:08:52,014
Love to be a part of one
someday.

216
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:56,952
Um, we should...

217
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:58,020
Yeah, all right.

218
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,088
All right, see you guys
down there.

219
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,589
See you guys.

220
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:02,391
Change your mind, come back up.

221
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:03,692
I'll do a shot
with you, Michael.

222
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:04,994
Yechh, don't be gross.

223
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:06,433
It's not even lunch yet.

224
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:11,552
SWAG!

225
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,854
Stuff We All Get.

226
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:16,056
I basically decorated
my condo for free

227
00:09:16,058 --> 00:09:18,659
with all of my SWAG!

228
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:20,861
Check it out.

229
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,829
Hi, I'm Michael Scott.
Dunder Mifflin.

230
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:24,031
Dwight Schrute.

231
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:25,098
Assistant Regional Manager,
Dunder Mifflin.

232
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,700
I am a huge fan.

233
00:09:26,702 --> 00:09:27,935
Thanks.
I appreciate it, guys.

234
00:09:27,937 --> 00:09:29,002
You know what?

235
00:09:29,004 --> 00:09:31,204
I am having
a big blowout tonight, room 308.

236
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,272
Hope you can come.

237
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:33,273
I...maybe.
If I can.

238
00:09:33,275 --> 00:09:34,474
Well, cool!

239
00:09:34,476 --> 00:09:37,344
Okay, so can I tell people
you're gonna be there?

240
00:09:37,346 --> 00:09:38,879
No, you cannot.

241
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:41,348
So maybe.
See ya.

242
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,983
Why do they call him The Bus?

243
00:09:42,985 --> 00:09:44,017
Because he's afraid to fly.

244
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,686
Smile.

245
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:47,621
Do you remember me
from last year?

246
00:09:47,623 --> 00:09:49,990
There's a party in my room, 308.

247
00:09:49,992 --> 00:09:51,224
Can't miss it.
Right off the elevator.

248
00:09:51,226 --> 00:09:52,960
Tonight.
Be there.

249
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:54,928
All right, Jan just emailed me.

250
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:56,797
She wants us
to meet her up front.

251
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,732
Yep.
Yeah, she's up front.

252
00:09:58,734 --> 00:10:00,367
You don't have email
on your phone.

253
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:03,837
I don't have to, I just know.

254
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,340
Yes, hello?

255
00:10:06,342 --> 00:10:07,507
No one just called you.

256
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:09,309
All right, nice meeting you.
Take care.

257
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,777
See you soon.
Take care.

258
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,679
Bye-bye.

259
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,982
May I have a moment
of your time, please?

260
00:10:16,384 --> 00:10:17,484
I need you to do something
for me.

261
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:18,518
Yes, anything.

262
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,554
I want you to
dig up some dirt on Josh.

263
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:22,556
Find out if there are
any skeletons in his attic.

264
00:10:22,558 --> 00:10:24,291
I'll talk to my buddy
down at the station stat.

265
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,394
Hey, Pam.

266
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:28,795
Hey, what's up?
What's up?

267
00:10:29,898 --> 00:10:31,064
I wanted to ask if you wanted...

268
00:10:31,066 --> 00:10:34,234
Dunder Mifflin, this is Pam.

269
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:38,005
He's not in the office.
Can I take a message?

270
00:10:38,007 --> 00:10:39,506
I will.

271
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:42,376
You too.

272
00:10:42,378 --> 00:10:43,377
Sorry.
What's up?

273
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:47,581
Um, if, uh...

274
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:50,050
Um...

275
00:10:50,052 --> 00:10:54,621
I just completely forgot
what I was going to say.

276
00:10:54,623 --> 00:10:55,656
That's so weird.

277
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:58,091
Okay.

278
00:10:58,093 --> 00:10:59,793
Well, if you think of it,
I'll be here.

279
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:02,129
Okay.

280
00:11:08,136 --> 00:11:11,238
So I called my buddy
down at the station today.

281
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,239
Mm-hmm.

282
00:11:12,241 --> 00:11:13,340
I had him run a background check

283
00:11:13,342 --> 00:11:14,675
on Josh Porter.

284
00:11:14,677 --> 00:11:17,544
See if there's
any known aliases, etc.

285
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:19,046
And?

286
00:11:19,048 --> 00:11:22,215
He wasn't volunteering today.

287
00:11:24,787 --> 00:11:26,753
Yeah.

288
00:11:26,755 --> 00:11:29,022
Things have been pretty crazy
around the office.

289
00:11:29,024 --> 00:11:30,090
Oh, yeah?

290
00:11:30,092 --> 00:11:31,591
Yeah.

291
00:11:31,593 --> 00:11:33,126
We moved Ryan over to your desk.

292
00:11:33,128 --> 00:11:35,729
Oh.
Tell him I say hi.

293
00:11:35,731 --> 00:11:38,098
I will call him later
with that message.

294
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,401
Hey, how's...
Toby?

295
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:44,705
Toby Flenderson is everything
that is wrong

296
00:11:44,707 --> 00:11:46,473
with the paper industry.

297
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:47,541
Is he why you left?

298
00:11:47,543 --> 00:11:49,142
Oh, no.
It was just...

299
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:50,277
you know,
a good opportunity for me,

300
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,278
a promotion.

301
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,081
Opportunity, promotion.
Blah blah.

302
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,749
You know, Jim,
those are just words.

303
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:58,318
Have you taken into account

304
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,786
other factors?

305
00:11:59,788 --> 00:12:00,954
Vis-à-vis bosses?

306
00:12:00,956 --> 00:12:03,023
Is Josh funnier than I am?

307
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,291
Does he even have a girlfriend?

308
00:12:04,293 --> 00:12:06,326
Because I have two, basically.

309
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:08,395
Michael, it's really not
a competition.

310
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,165
Jim got a us a great lead
with a new rep

311
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,400
from National Envelope.

312
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:14,668
We can grab lunch
with him tomorrow.

313
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,336
Hey, Jan.
Jan?

314
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,572
Don't worry.
I have got the tip.

315
00:12:18,574 --> 00:12:19,906
Whoa, Michael.

316
00:12:19,908 --> 00:12:22,676
Wow.
Oh, my God, thank you.

317
00:12:22,678 --> 00:12:23,810
Is that your per diem?

318
00:12:23,812 --> 00:12:26,279
No, that was a different
hundred dollar bill.

319
00:12:26,281 --> 00:12:27,614
What have you generated,
Michael?

320
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:30,250
I have generated
a lot of interest

321
00:12:30,252 --> 00:12:32,152
in my party this evening.

322
00:12:32,154 --> 00:12:33,820
What party?

323
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,489
Party I'm having tonight in 308.

324
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:37,157
Obviously, you are invited.

325
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,427
Michael, um...

326
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,529
Jim and Josh are in meetings

327
00:12:42,531 --> 00:12:44,264
all day and I am

328
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:47,667
in and out of meetings.

329
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:50,504
I can't stay on top of you 24/7.

330
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,877
You should order

331
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,879
the most expensive thing
on the menu.

332
00:12:58,881 --> 00:12:59,946
So he knows you're worth it.

333
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,917
If you do that,
you're gonna have to put out.

334
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,988
Oh, yeah.
You'll have to put out.

335
00:13:09,624 --> 00:13:13,760
Is there a key for Jane Doe?

336
00:13:13,762 --> 00:13:17,764
Thank you.

337
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:21,067
Any messages for 308?

338
00:13:21,069 --> 00:13:22,869
All right.

339
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:24,104
Hey hey, fellers.

340
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:25,539
- Michael.
- Hey, Michael.

341
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:26,807
Hey, what's up?

342
00:13:26,809 --> 00:13:28,575
Uh, well, Jim and I
have a meeting with Uniball

343
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,110
in about 45 minutes,
so we should probably go.

344
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,045
Hey, check this out.

345
00:13:32,047 --> 00:13:33,046
How about that?

346
00:13:33,048 --> 00:13:34,514
A little friendly competition.

347
00:13:34,516 --> 00:13:35,982
Stamford versus Scranton.

348
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:37,150
I don't think so.

349
00:13:37,152 --> 00:13:38,685
Oh.
Jim?

350
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:40,220
Looks like you picked a bad time

351
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:43,356
to defect, my friend.

352
00:13:43,358 --> 00:13:44,424
Fine.
All right.

353
00:13:44,426 --> 00:13:45,492
Okay.

354
00:13:45,494 --> 00:13:46,827
Excellent.

355
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,763
Oh, just shut it.

356
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,534
Hey, Pam, what's up?

357
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:56,403
Yeah... uh, no.
Tell him I will give him

358
00:13:56,405 --> 00:13:58,004
general specifics tomorrow,
okay?

359
00:13:58,006 --> 00:14:01,575
Yes.
Say hi to Pam!

360
00:14:01,577 --> 00:14:03,109
Hi, Pam.

361
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,711
Yes, that is Josh
and Dwight and Jim.

362
00:14:04,713 --> 00:14:06,379
Pam says hi.

363
00:14:06,381 --> 00:14:08,515
Have fun on your date.

364
00:14:08,517 --> 00:14:10,350
Very good.
Talk to you later.

365
00:14:10,352 --> 00:14:12,452
Bye.

366
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,792
You first.

367
00:14:20,795 --> 00:14:22,329
Oh, nice try, Josh!

368
00:14:22,331 --> 00:14:24,531
Not.
Hit the rim.

369
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:27,934
Okay, and...

370
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,303
Okay, double or nothing.

371
00:14:30,305 --> 00:14:32,138
What, we didn't
bet anything, Michael.

372
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,740
Well, let's...

373
00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:34,875
You know, we should go.

374
00:14:34,877 --> 00:14:36,343
Come on, come on.
Come on!

375
00:14:36,345 --> 00:14:38,845
We'll do it later.

376
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,614
Say, while I have you here,

377
00:14:40,616 --> 00:14:42,682
can I talk to you about
some new and exciting advances

378
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:44,284
to our product line?
Fine.

379
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:46,553
Jim and I have different
definitions of friendship.

380
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:48,555
I think it's talking
and being friends

381
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,891
and Jim thinks
it's moving to Connecticut

382
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:52,759
and being best friends
with Josh.

383
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,994
Well...

384
00:14:53,996 --> 00:14:56,563
phooey on that.

385
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:58,598
I, uh...
I'm done.

386
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,934
I am not going to be
speaking with him anymore.

387
00:15:00,936 --> 00:15:02,168
Whatevs.

388
00:15:02,170 --> 00:15:04,671
Long distance relationships
never work.

389
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:07,307
That is so true.

390
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:08,808
Ready?
Mm-hmm.

391
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,878
Okay, let me tell you
what we're looking for.

392
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:13,999
Sorry, my meeting ran late.

393
00:15:15,735 --> 00:15:16,968
- Really?
- Yes, Jan.

394
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,403
Really.

395
00:15:18,405 --> 00:15:19,805
With a rep from Hammermill.

396
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,806
They're exclusive with Staples.

397
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:21,807
Used to be.

398
00:15:21,809 --> 00:15:23,408
Evan'll call you in the morning

399
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,876
to work out the details.

400
00:15:24,878 --> 00:15:26,244
We can now
sell Hammermill products.

401
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:27,379
Yes!

402
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,481
Ha!

403
00:15:29,483 --> 00:15:32,250
Well, Michael...

404
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,285
I underestimated you.

405
00:15:33,287 --> 00:15:35,620
Yeah, well, maybe next time

406
00:15:35,622 --> 00:15:37,022
you will estimate me.

407
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:42,627
Dwight's room key.

408
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,197
And Dwight's room.

409
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,699
What can I say?
Old habits die hard.

410
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:49,234
D?

411
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:54,272
Oh, my God.
Dwight got a hooker.

412
00:15:54,274 --> 00:15:56,074
Oh, my God, I gotta call...

413
00:15:56,076 --> 00:15:57,142
I gotta call somebody.

414
00:15:57,144 --> 00:15:59,344
I don't even know who to call.

415
00:15:59,346 --> 00:16:00,879
Dwight got a hooker!

416
00:16:00,881 --> 00:16:04,282
So, Allen, Pam is obsessed
with your cartoons.

417
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,518
She reads them every day.

418
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,286
Oh, great.

419
00:16:08,288 --> 00:16:09,354
I don't like ketchup.

420
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:11,456
You love ketchup.
He loves ketchup.

421
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:17,095
So how do you come up
with your cartoons?

422
00:16:17,097 --> 00:16:21,366
I just... I kinda think about
stuff that I see.

423
00:16:21,368 --> 00:16:23,401
Or dream them.

424
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,071
You dream in cartoons?
How fun.

425
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,143
Hey!
First guest!

426
00:16:31,145 --> 00:16:33,145
You are going to have
some tequila, my friend.

427
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:35,881
Um, I thought there was
a party in here.

428
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:36,882
This is the party.

429
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:39,284
This is room 308?
Party central.

430
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,253
So what can I do you for?

431
00:16:41,255 --> 00:16:45,323
All right.

432
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:48,059
See this one is great.

433
00:16:48,061 --> 00:16:50,562
Because it could work
on a couple different levels.

434
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:52,030
Huh.

435
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:55,066
Your freedom fries
for the table.

436
00:16:55,068 --> 00:16:59,304
Freedom fries.
Yeah.

437
00:16:59,306 --> 00:17:01,006
Yeah.

438
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:02,274
People always say, like,
don't be edgy.

439
00:17:02,276 --> 00:17:04,442
But, I don't know.

440
00:17:04,444 --> 00:17:05,644
I don't know any other way.

441
00:17:05,646 --> 00:17:06,745
Oh.

442
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:09,047
Yeah, you get it.

443
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:26,431
Well, it was really nice
meeting you, Allen.

444
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,333
Yeah, next time bring some of
your illustrations.

445
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:29,801
I'll let you pick my brain.

446
00:17:31,238 --> 00:17:32,637
More freedom fries.
Yeah.

447
00:17:32,639 --> 00:17:33,705
That's great.
Okay.

448
00:17:33,707 --> 00:17:35,740
I went on a date.

449
00:17:35,742 --> 00:17:38,076
It wasn't a love connection.

450
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:41,179
Um, I think when
I like someone again,

451
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:43,348
I'll just kind of know.

452
00:18:02,369 --> 00:18:03,335
Michael.

453
00:18:09,175 --> 00:18:11,243
Am I the first the arrive?

454
00:18:11,245 --> 00:18:15,447
People have been filtering
in and out.

455
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:17,549
Can I get a drink?

456
00:18:17,551 --> 00:18:18,850
What?

457
00:18:18,852 --> 00:18:20,986
Can I get a drink?

458
00:18:20,988 --> 00:18:24,089
Sure.

459
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,394
You like cosmos?

460
00:18:29,396 --> 00:18:31,730
Yeah, sure.
Sounds good.

461
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:32,797
So why are you here?

462
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,432
Is Josh busy?

463
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:35,734
Michael...

464
00:18:35,736 --> 00:18:37,202
I get it, you know?

465
00:18:37,204 --> 00:18:38,336
- Did I do something?
- No, I totally get it.

466
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:41,039
He made a better paper airplane.

467
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:44,042
Stamford does better in sales.

468
00:18:44,044 --> 00:18:45,277
I get it.
We had some fun.

469
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:46,645
We had some laughs.

470
00:18:46,647 --> 00:18:49,014
Wait wait wait, I didn't
transfer because of you.

471
00:18:49,016 --> 00:18:51,516
You're a good boss.

472
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:53,852
You're a great boss.

473
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:57,522
Pfff.

474
00:18:57,524 --> 00:18:59,357
Not better than Josh.

475
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,561
Michael, it's not about...

476
00:19:03,563 --> 00:19:05,096
I transferred because of Pam.

477
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,869
Oh, my God.

478
00:19:10,871 --> 00:19:13,038
You don't even know.
She's single now.

479
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,740
No, I heard
something about that.

480
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:17,375
It's just, I kind of

481
00:19:17,377 --> 00:19:21,112
put it all on the line.

482
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:23,148
Twice, actually.

483
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,217
And she said no.
Twice.

484
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,522
I'm sorry, man.

485
00:19:30,524 --> 00:19:31,890
I'm sorry.

486
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:36,461
Hey, you know what?
I will talk to her.

487
00:19:36,463 --> 00:19:37,929
No, that's okay.
Yeah.

488
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:39,531
That's all right.
I will.

489
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,933
I'll talk to her.

490
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:44,169
You should at least
talk to... Roy.

491
00:19:44,171 --> 00:19:46,204
I mean, he knows
exactly how you're feeling.

492
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:49,941
Yeah.

493
00:19:49,943 --> 00:19:52,610
Okay, maybe.

494
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,512
Are we early?

495
00:19:54,514 --> 00:19:55,613
Hey, no.
You know, people have been

496
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:56,681
filtering in and out.

497
00:19:56,683 --> 00:19:58,016
Hey.

498
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,784
Evan, this is Jim.
How are ya?

499
00:19:59,786 --> 00:20:02,420
Hey, Arnie Risman.
Michael, Jim.

500
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:03,722
Hey, Arnie, how you doing?

501
00:20:03,724 --> 00:20:05,557
You guys work together?

502
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,925
No, we used to.

503
00:20:06,927 --> 00:20:08,860
- Yeah.
- Now, we're friends.

504
00:20:08,862 --> 00:20:12,263
Best friends.

505
00:20:12,265 --> 00:20:15,367
Some people
need dozens of friends

506
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:17,702
to say, hey, look at me,
I'm popular.

507
00:20:17,704 --> 00:20:19,337
But not me.
I'm very picky.

508
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:21,506
I need three.
Maybe two?

509
00:20:21,508 --> 00:20:23,675
When you meet
that someone special,

510
00:20:23,677 --> 00:20:25,243
you'll just know.

511
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:28,279
Because a real relationship...

512
00:20:28,281 --> 00:20:30,582
can't be forced.

513
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:33,620
It should just come about
effortledlessly.

514
00:20:34,222 --> 00:20:35,388
Now, would you do me
the pleasure of

515
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:38,057
hitting the lights, sir?

516
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,394
Ha ha ha ha.

517
00:20:41,396 --> 00:20:42,595
Ha ha ha ha ha!

518
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:46,399
Whoa.
What are all those stains?

519
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:48,001
Blood, urine, or semen.

520
00:20:48,003 --> 00:20:49,902
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
