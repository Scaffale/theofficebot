1
00:00:02,601 --> 00:00:07,004
<i>Oscar, Toby said he
left my Girl Scout cookies on my chair.</i>

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:10,499
<i>Have you seen them?
Wait, I'm sitting on them.</i>

3
00:00:10,776 --> 00:00:11,936
This is awesome.

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,944
Thank you. It didn't
even take that long.

5
00:00:14,012 --> 00:00:16,708
<i>What's the difference
between a chimichanga,</i>

6
00:00:16,782 --> 00:00:19,444
<i>a chalupa and a tostada?</i>

7
00:00:19,718 --> 00:00:24,655
<i>Call me back ASAP.
It's urgent.</i>

8
00:00:24,923 --> 00:00:29,417
Wait, this isn't funny.
I don't talk like that.

9
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:30,927
Say, "Me eat cookie."

10
00:00:31,363 --> 00:00:33,194
No. I won't say it.

11
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:34,823
Why is everyone
clumped around accounting?

12
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,958
Break it up, you clique.

13
00:00:36,034 --> 00:00:39,026
<i>It's Kevin as Cookie
Monster from Sesame Street.</i>

14
00:00:39,104 --> 00:00:41,038
Is that the program where all
those puppets live in the barrio?

15
00:00:41,106 --> 00:00:42,573
Mmm-hmm.
I love that show.

16
00:00:42,641 --> 00:00:45,201
<i>This is Kevin.
This is Kevin.</i>

17
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:47,778
Thank you.
That is an amusing link.

18
00:00:47,846 --> 00:00:49,006
I'd like it sent
to me, please.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,638
Me, too, Oscar, please send
it to me. Yeah, totally.

20
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,580
Yeah, me, too.

21
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:54,676
Angela,
this is inappropriate.

22
00:00:54,953 --> 00:00:56,750
This is my favorite day.

23
00:01:17,742 --> 00:01:19,539
It's Secretary's Day.

24
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,310
And it is Erin's and my
three-week anniversary,

25
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:26,908
<i>so perfect storm
for a romantic gesture.</i>

26
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:30,549
<i>Want to make sure the whole office
remembers it's Secretary's Day.</i>

27
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:34,524
<i>I sent an email blast, a text blast,
a good old-fashioned talk blast.</i>

28
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:36,788
<i>I sent a snail-mail
blast a week ago,</i>

29
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,490
<i>and a stern reminder via fax
at 7:00 this morning,</i>

30
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:43,466
<i>so people better step up and
appreciate the crap out of Erin.</i>

31
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:44,559
Oh, thank you.

32
00:01:44,636 --> 00:01:45,728
<i>I do.</i>

33
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,270
Thank you.

34
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:54,836
If it wasn't for secretaries,
I wouldn't have a stepmom.

35
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,381
Welcome back.
Hey, thanks.

36
00:01:57,449 --> 00:02:01,943
<i>It's my first day back after
maternity leave, and I miss Cece, of course.</i>

37
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:04,152
<i>But we need the money.</i>

38
00:02:04,523 --> 00:02:08,357
What was maternity leave
like? Oh. How do I explain it?

39
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:11,887
It rocked.
It rocked my ass off.

40
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,829
Oh. You couldn't
have watered it?

41
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:20,429
I literally did not know that
existed until this moment.

42
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:24,204
Well, I knew it existed,
and I chose to let it die.

43
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:26,476
It's nice to see
you again, Dwight.

44
00:02:26,545 --> 00:02:27,637
Hello, Pam.

45
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,476
I was just wondering what you
had planned for Secretary's Day.

46
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:32,312
I'm going to give Erin $15.

47
00:02:32,384 --> 00:02:37,014
I know that Erin would be so
psyched if you took her out to lunch.

48
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,617
A one-on-one
lunch with Erin?

49
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,090
Yeah. She really
looks up to you.

50
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:43,525
There's only so much we
can do as her coworkers.

51
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:47,156
Secretary's Day is really
kind of a boss-secretary thing.

52
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,129
She's kind of a rube.

53
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:54,398
That's my girlfriend
you're talking about.

54
00:02:54,472 --> 00:02:57,908
Okay. All right. All right.
Okay, I'll take her to lunch.

55
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,807
She's gonna be so psyched.

56
00:03:00,078 --> 00:03:02,239
Hi, Erin.
Happy Secretary's Day.

57
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,713
Well, happy boss's day.

58
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:05,873
There wouldn't be a secretary
if there was no boss.

59
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:07,885
I wanted to know what
your plans for lunch were,

60
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:11,912
because I was hoping
to ask you to lunch.

61
00:03:12,257 --> 00:03:15,090
I got a picture of you
asking me to lunch.

62
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,861
I was thinking we could go to
Hayworth's, just the two of us.

63
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,830
Well, Hayworth's
is more business-casual,

64
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:23,231
and they always screw
up your order, so I'm...

65
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:26,634
Oh. Yeah, okay. Yeah, that
was a stupid suggestion.

66
00:03:26,705 --> 00:03:29,503
I was thinking someplace special,
so I thought Hayworth's, but...

67
00:03:29,574 --> 00:03:30,905
Okay, well, we'll figure something out.

68
00:03:30,976 --> 00:03:32,637
Okay.

69
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:36,510
Okay, let's go
to Hayworth's.

70
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:37,741
Okay!

71
00:03:38,683 --> 00:03:40,344
Have a cookie, Kev.

72
00:03:40,418 --> 00:03:43,854
Yeah, ha, ha, tray of cookies.
I'm not falling for that.

73
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:46,587
I brought those in.
It's my birthday.

74
00:03:46,658 --> 00:03:48,819
That's some stone-cold
narcissism right there.

75
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:50,793
Man, Darryl, I'm sorry.

76
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,556
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

77
00:03:59,337 --> 00:04:02,067
<i>They're making fun of
Cookie Monster. I get that.</i>

78
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:06,007
But in a strange way, it feels
like they're making fun of me.

79
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:11,438
<i>Oscar, did you
eat some of my M&M's? The level...</i>

80
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,074
This is violent
and offensive.

81
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:14,345
Thank you.

82
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,287
And it really makes me
self-conscious about my voice.

83
00:04:17,355 --> 00:04:18,822
That's awful.

84
00:04:20,091 --> 00:04:21,718
I'm not crying.

85
00:04:21,793 --> 00:04:23,158
You have some
food on your face.

86
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:26,391
<i>Do my hands feel
sweaty to you?</i>

87
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,097
<i>The beginning here has
been a little bit of a fiasco.</i>

88
00:04:29,334 --> 00:04:32,963
Either they don't respect me,
or they respect me too much.

89
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:36,768
And some of them still think
that I'm the IT guy.

90
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:39,803
This Cookie Monster thing is
an opportunity to show people

91
00:04:39,878 --> 00:04:42,073
that I'm an authority figure.

92
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:48,074
Hello, everyone. If I might
have a moment of your time.

93
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,752
It's come to my attention
that people have been watching

94
00:04:50,822 --> 00:04:53,222
and laughing at
a hurtful parody video.

95
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:57,785
It is now forbidden to talk,
joke about, or email this around.

96
00:04:58,063 --> 00:04:59,155
Yeah.

97
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:02,055
And that's straight
from corporate, so...

98
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:04,761
Not to be scary, but,
yeah, I would listen to me.

99
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:06,360
And that's all.

100
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,241
Would you mind if I
listened to my book on tape?

101
00:05:18,316 --> 00:05:20,216
I'm kind of a bookworm.

102
00:05:20,719 --> 00:05:25,281
<i>This is a novelization of the movie
Precious, Based on the Book Push by Sapphire.</i>

103
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:28,814
I was thinking it would be
fun to talk on the way over.

104
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,225
What decade would you have
chosen to be a teenager?

105
00:05:34,332 --> 00:05:35,697
I don't know.

106
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:37,462
I would have
chosen the 1490s.

107
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:40,534
'Cause America
was discovered.

108
00:05:40,605 --> 00:05:41,629
Right.

109
00:05:44,676 --> 00:05:47,201
And then my last job was
at a Taco Bell Express,

110
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:51,647
but then it became a full Taco Bell
and, I don't know, I couldn't keep up.

111
00:05:51,716 --> 00:05:55,049
My favorite part about being a receptionist
is that I get to have my own desk.

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,180
At my foster home I never
had a desk, so it's like...

113
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:00,884
I don't mean that I didn't like
my foster home. I did like it.

114
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,790
I just didn't have
a desk there.

115
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:05,853
Did you have a favorite age? Or month?

116
00:06:07,365 --> 00:06:08,696
An age or month?

117
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:12,703
Yeah, like a favorite month. Like,
I liked April when I was seven.

118
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:16,070
I've been trying. I've been
trying to keep it going.

119
00:06:18,676 --> 00:06:21,167
Erin is just weird.

120
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,481
How many pillows
do you sleep on at night?

121
00:06:23,548 --> 00:06:25,948
So how are
things going with Andy?

122
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:28,281
He's the best boyfriend
in the world.

123
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,211
Tell me about him
before I met him.

124
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:32,756
Well, let's see...

125
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:37,357
Andy plays the banjo.

126
00:06:37,428 --> 00:06:39,089
Yeah, I love that.

127
00:06:39,564 --> 00:06:44,263
Other than the fact that he dated Angela,
I don't think he is a snappy dresser.

128
00:06:44,335 --> 00:06:45,461
What?

129
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:48,300
I don't think he is the best
dresser. Reminds me of Easter.

130
00:06:48,373 --> 00:06:52,434
Sorry. About Angela.
Did you say he dated Angela?

131
00:06:53,011 --> 00:06:56,071
Mmm-hmm.
You didn't know that?

132
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:57,705
Here we go.
Hot plate.

133
00:06:57,782 --> 00:06:58,806
Oh, okay.

134
00:06:58,883 --> 00:07:00,680
And your
salad, miss.

135
00:07:01,953 --> 00:07:03,580
Why wouldn't
he tell me that?

136
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:04,883
I don't know.

137
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,880
Probably didn't want you
to have a mental image

138
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:09,392
of him having sex
with somebody else.

139
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,484
They had sex?

140
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,530
They were engaged, so...

141
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,524
Okay, you know what, sir?

142
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:17,659
Yes?

143
00:07:17,735 --> 00:07:20,499
Yeah, I asked for pickles on my burger,
and there are only, like, five or six.

144
00:07:20,572 --> 00:07:21,937
Can I get some
more pickles?

145
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,201
Of course. I'll get
you a bowl of pickles.

146
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,469
Thank you.

147
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:27,302
They were engaged?

148
00:07:27,378 --> 00:07:28,640
Mmm-hmm.

149
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:30,907
Yeah.

150
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:33,743
Uh-oh.

151
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:34,978
Well...

152
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,852
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

153
00:07:41,926 --> 00:07:44,759
In the foster home,
my hair was my room.

154
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,202
Okay, okay, you know what?
You know what? You know what?

155
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:55,865
Everybody's looking
at you right now.

156
00:08:00,078 --> 00:08:02,205
I'll have what
she's having.

157
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:10,081
Did you have a...
Did you like your lunch?

158
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:11,621
Did you have a good lunch?

159
00:08:12,957 --> 00:08:15,790
Did you like that?
Did you enjoy your food?

160
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,521
It was good.
I liked my lunch.

161
00:08:21,065 --> 00:08:22,396
What's up?

162
00:08:22,634 --> 00:08:24,829
Her milk is coming in.
She's getting uncomfortable.

163
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:25,927
Dwight, don't be gross.

164
00:08:26,004 --> 00:08:27,835
No, no, he's right.

165
00:08:28,406 --> 00:08:31,671
Same thing happens with my cows if
I don't tend them frequently enough.

166
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,234
You gotta milk them, or
else they'll moo like crazy.

167
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:35,836
That's weird,
my breast pump is missing.

168
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:37,438
Have you seen
my breast pump?

169
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,142
All right, this is
gonna traumatize me

170
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:42,277
a hell of a lot more
than you, believe me.

171
00:08:42,353 --> 00:08:46,016
You know what, Dwight? Let me just
check the bathroom first. Okay?

172
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:48,888
Really? Fine.
Let your breasts explode.

173
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,791
Three squeezes
and I would drain you.

174
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:52,295
Mmm.

175
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,464
Meredith! MEREDITH: I
just like the way it feels.

176
00:08:57,535 --> 00:08:59,332
- What are you doing?
- Just relax, okay?

177
00:08:59,404 --> 00:09:00,393
Relax?

178
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:01,802
This is like
the Cadillac of pumps.

179
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:02,999
Give it
back to me, now!

180
00:09:03,074 --> 00:09:05,099
Okay. I was just
warming it up.

181
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,336
That's...
It's disgusting!

182
00:09:06,411 --> 00:09:07,605
It's not a big deal.

183
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,010
It's not sterile!

184
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,775
We're both girls.
Who cares?

185
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:27,557
So, how was lunch?

186
00:09:28,066 --> 00:09:29,397
Lunch was fine.

187
00:09:29,467 --> 00:09:33,028
Was it everything that you
hoped and dreamed it might be?

188
00:09:33,805 --> 00:09:35,830
I don't know.
It was lunch, Andy.

189
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:38,569
Well, I know, I'm...
That's what I'm...

190
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,403
Just wondering...
I mean...

191
00:09:43,548 --> 00:09:45,345
Erin, I think we're
out of fax cover sheets.

192
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,681
God, Oscar, will you keep
your pants on? It's easy.

193
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:56,149
My name
is Kevin. I'm an accountant.

194
00:09:56,227 --> 00:09:57,455
You see?
I did the voice.

195
00:09:57,528 --> 00:09:59,257
It's a little derivative.

196
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,695
But parody is
always derivative.

197
00:10:00,765 --> 00:10:02,756
It's not organic.
Do you know what I mean?

198
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:04,461
Jim does a really good one. Do yours.

199
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:06,765
Oh, guys, I really
refuse to participate.

200
00:10:06,838 --> 00:10:09,932
"Michael, can
I have an advance on my paycheck,

201
00:10:10,008 --> 00:10:13,739
"because a Mrs. Fields Cookies
just opened up at the mall!"

202
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:17,472
<i>Guys, why don't we leave the
parodies to the pros at MADtv?</i>

203
00:10:17,548 --> 00:10:21,279
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show
hasn't been on in many cookies."

204
00:10:21,486 --> 00:10:22,578
Okay.

205
00:10:23,988 --> 00:10:26,081
Hey, can I have
your attention, please?

206
00:10:26,157 --> 00:10:27,146
First of all,
thanks to everyone

207
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:30,524
for helping put this
awesome party together,

208
00:10:30,595 --> 00:10:35,089
and a very special shout-out to the
chair of the party planning committee,

209
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:38,659
Miss Angela Martin.
You have outdone yourself.

210
00:10:39,137 --> 00:10:40,229
Yeah, you know what?

211
00:10:40,304 --> 00:10:43,740
I think we can all agree that
Angela's not so great, so...

212
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:46,504
I'm saying the exact opposite.
Angela is fantastic.

213
00:10:46,577 --> 00:10:48,101
No, no, no.

214
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:49,510
Specific shout-out.

215
00:10:49,714 --> 00:10:50,908
Stop talking.

216
00:10:50,982 --> 00:10:56,579
Okay. As some of you may know, I have a
very special connection to Secretary's Day

217
00:10:56,654 --> 00:11:01,751
in the form of that 115-pound
moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon.

218
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:05,290
To a lot of you she may just be the person
who brings you your fax confirmations,

219
00:11:05,363 --> 00:11:08,298
but to me,
she is my girlfriend,

220
00:11:09,033 --> 00:11:12,730
in addition to being the person
who brings me my fax confirmations.

221
00:11:12,804 --> 00:11:16,831
So, I wrote
a little ditty

222
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,274
that I would like to play
for all of you right now.

223
00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,840
<i>It's a little tune called
Secretary of Love.</i>

224
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:30,186
One, two, one, two, three...

225
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:32,988
I know about Angela.

226
00:11:33,057 --> 00:11:34,456
I know that you
were engaged to her

227
00:11:34,525 --> 00:11:35,583
and that you were
sleeping with her.

228
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,685
Michael told me.
Oh, God.

229
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:40,127
Erin, can we talk
about this in private?

230
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:43,827
I don't want it to be in
private. Is it true or is it not?

231
00:11:46,604 --> 00:11:48,435
Yes. Who else did you sleep with?

232
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:53,000
Did you sleep with Phyllis or
Kelly or Pam? Maybe all together?

233
00:11:53,077 --> 00:11:54,066
No. No. No. No.

234
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,272
Did everyone know? Was I
the only one who didn't know?

235
00:11:56,347 --> 00:11:57,371
Yeah. Pretty much.

236
00:11:57,482 --> 00:11:58,471
Pretty much.
Yeah.

237
00:11:58,616 --> 00:12:02,416
Who are you? I don't know you. Get away!

238
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:08,615
I should probably
get involved in this,

239
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:12,925
but I think my energy is better
spent on the Cookie Monster issue.

240
00:12:13,931 --> 00:12:17,867
Erin, you know, if I had been
engaged to anybody before you,

241
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,800
I would have told you.

242
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:21,695
Thanks.

243
00:12:21,772 --> 00:12:24,832
So if you need anything,
I'm right over there.

244
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,940
"Hey, Erin, you
look delicious! I mean, beautiful."

245
00:12:32,817 --> 00:12:36,184
Okay. Okay.
There, I heard that.

246
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,848
So, I'm sorry, Pam,
but that's it.

247
00:12:39,257 --> 00:12:42,886
I'm going to have to suspend
you without pay for two days.

248
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,326
What? What do you mean, suspend me?

249
00:12:45,396 --> 00:12:46,829
I think you need
to go a little easy.

250
00:12:46,898 --> 00:12:48,229
You can't just suspend
someone from work.

251
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:52,099
Yeah, you're right. You know
what? You're suspended too, Jim.

252
00:12:55,406 --> 00:12:57,033
Okay.
Fine. You too, Dwight.

253
00:12:57,108 --> 00:13:00,509
Wait, what? I was just slow-clapping
your no-nonsense decision-making.

254
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:03,069
I don't want to hear it.
Suspended.

255
00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:07,850
"C" is for suspension.

256
00:13:10,588 --> 00:13:14,786
Why would that be something that you
would talk about on Secretary's Day?

257
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:18,158
Andy, she's not the easiest person in
the world to have a conversation with.

258
00:13:18,229 --> 00:13:21,665
All right? And besides, who
doesn't tell their girlfriend

259
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:25,190
that they were engaged to someone
who works four feet away from them?

260
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,636
<i>That's like... That's... That's
like Mr. & Mrs. Smith crap.</i>

261
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:31,174
I was gonna tell her,
just on my own time.

262
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:34,643
You know what? I resent the implication
that I would keep that secret.

263
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:38,273
Everyone here knows that I
can't and won't keep a secret.

264
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:41,314
<i>Who cares?</i>

265
00:13:41,586 --> 00:13:46,489
I mean, it's not like I killed
somebody. Big deal, right?

266
00:13:46,557 --> 00:13:48,457
This is gonna blow
over in two seconds.

267
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:50,960
She never asked me, so if you
think about it, it's kind of...

268
00:13:51,028 --> 00:13:54,828
I probably should have told her, I
guess. Everybody does stupid things.

269
00:13:56,834 --> 00:13:58,267
Psst.

270
00:13:58,336 --> 00:14:00,361
Hey. Erin.

271
00:14:01,472 --> 00:14:04,202
You want to talk to me,
come to my desk.

272
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:16,385
You embarrassed me earlier.

273
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:18,547
Take it up with
the chief of police.

274
00:14:18,656 --> 00:14:22,922
You think I want people remembering
I had sensual relations with Andy?

275
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,790
It's the kind of thing you
wish you could have annulled.

276
00:14:24,862 --> 00:14:26,659
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

277
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:29,097
I want to throw up
just thinking about it.

278
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:31,600
You are throwing up
for the wrong reasons.

279
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:34,263
I don't think this
fax is going through.

280
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,466
Oh...

281
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,738
Is there a different... I guess
put it through again, you know?

282
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:49,877
Hey.

283
00:14:51,622 --> 00:14:54,489
You know,
I was engaged before Jim.

284
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,618
Really?

285
00:14:57,695 --> 00:14:59,526
Yeah. And he
worked here, too.

286
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,623
It was Andy,
wasn't it?

287
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,930
No, no, it wasn't Andy. It wasn't.

288
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:07,698
It doesn't matter.

289
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,437
It's not about
who you've been with.

290
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:12,942
It's about who
you end up with.

291
00:15:14,512 --> 00:15:19,108
Sometimes the heart doesn't know what
it wants until it finds what it wants.

292
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:27,952
I hope you find what
you're looking for.

293
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:32,726
Thank you.

294
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:47,672
So I can reprimand them,
but I can't suspend them?

295
00:15:49,613 --> 00:15:52,275
Oh, I can't do either?
Uh-huh.

296
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,442
Fair enough.

297
00:15:54,618 --> 00:15:56,279
<i>Hey, Toby.
- I called Tallahassee.</i>

298
00:15:56,354 --> 00:15:59,881
<i>Now, he can ask you not to come in, but
he can't dock your pay. It's not legal.</i>

299
00:15:59,957 --> 00:16:01,185
Very interesting.

300
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:03,692
<i>I also learned some interesting things
about how they structure their...</i>

301
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:05,661
Thanks, Toby.

302
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,357
Hey, everyone. Hi.

303
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:10,867
Quite an afternoon, huh?

304
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:14,098
Cathartic, in a way. I'm glad
that I got to share it with you.

305
00:16:14,438 --> 00:16:16,906
Makes you think about
what's really important.

306
00:16:16,974 --> 00:16:20,705
It's not about showing you're in charge
or flexing some sort of authority.

307
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:22,643
It's about forgiveness.

308
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:25,807
And, yes, I'm talking about you
three in this desk clump right here.

309
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,714
I think that if you
were to apologize to me,

310
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:30,049
then I would revoke
your suspension.

311
00:16:30,121 --> 00:16:32,248
I don't think
an apology is enough.

312
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:37,090
I really think the only way for me to
learn my lesson is to take my suspension.

313
00:16:37,528 --> 00:16:40,019
And I gotta take
this bad attitude

314
00:16:40,097 --> 00:16:42,122
and I gotta go home
and I got to adjust it.

315
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:43,996
Oh, come on. I hope
the suspension does that.

316
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,695
Yeah.
Prideful idiots.

317
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:50,139
Watch how it's done.
Gabriel, I apologize.

318
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,201
Great.

319
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,240
I kneel before you.

320
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,813
Guys, I would even take a
contrite look as an apology.

321
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:02,410
Humbly taking your hand upon
which I kiss to show my contrition.

322
00:17:04,522 --> 00:17:07,320
Guys, to...
To err is human.

323
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,428
Trust is the most
important thing to me.

324
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:17,091
Is your name
Andy Bernard?

325
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,102
What's your real name?
Lionel Frankenstein?

326
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,502
Will you stop walking
for one second?

327
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,040
That's it. There's no
other secrets, okay?

328
00:17:25,075 --> 00:17:28,772
I mean, yeah, my chest
is not naturally hairless,

329
00:17:28,846 --> 00:17:30,814
and my parents pay
my credit card bill.

330
00:17:30,881 --> 00:17:33,213
How long were
you guys together?

331
00:17:33,284 --> 00:17:34,478
A year.

332
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,580
A year?

333
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,788
You were together
for a year?

334
00:17:39,857 --> 00:17:43,315
Yeah. But that's it. Now
you know everything about me.

335
00:17:44,829 --> 00:17:47,821
I promise. And if I
think of anything else...

336
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:51,763
I think I have to be on
my own for a little bit.

337
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:56,967
<i>Like that girl Precious in Precious,
Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire. Okay?</i>

338
00:17:58,075 --> 00:18:00,043
I didn't see that movie.

339
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:06,846
That was ugly. I'm sorry
that you had to see that.

340
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,214
Well, do they
still get paid?

341
00:18:08,285 --> 00:18:10,378
It's tacky to
discuss finances.

342
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:12,319
It's best to pretend
that this never happened.

343
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,084
Sounds like they just got
to go home with pay.

344
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:15,750
Yeah.
Pathetic.

345
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,053
Can I buy
everyone coffees?

346
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,861
Or cookies!

347
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:25,959
- What was that?
- So gross.

348
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:27,162
Are you kidding me?

349
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,263
Was that an impression?
All right.

350
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:34,744
"Guys, I'm now going
to apologize for the mess that we're in,

351
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,006
"because corporate
told me to.

352
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:41,242
"I just want you to know,
I laugh like a crazy person."

353
00:18:41,318 --> 00:18:42,910
Okay, you gotta
be able to...

354
00:18:42,987 --> 00:18:46,650
You gotta be able to laugh at
yourself here. One of the gang.

355
00:18:46,724 --> 00:18:50,421
"I have to go back to the zoo
to the stick insect exhibit."

356
00:18:50,494 --> 00:18:52,121
Yeah.

357
00:18:53,764 --> 00:18:57,200
<i>"Ciao. " Right? "Ciao.</i>

358
00:18:57,601 --> 00:19:00,695
<i>"I say ciao 'cause I'm
fancy from Tallahassee."</i>

359
00:19:01,338 --> 00:19:04,136
<i>Why don't we say
ciao to the impressions?</i>

360
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:06,733
<i>Ciao.</i>

361
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:09,812
Stick insect.

362
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,473
God.

363
00:19:16,387 --> 00:19:17,479
Erin?
Oh.

364
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:19,914
Sorry. I thought
everyone was gone.

365
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,857
No, no. I was just watching Cookie
Monster. It finally downloaded.

366
00:19:22,927 --> 00:19:23,985
Do you mind
if I sit down?

367
00:19:24,061 --> 00:19:25,085
Yeah.

368
00:19:25,162 --> 00:19:26,424
What's...

369
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:30,263
I can't trust
Andy anymore.

370
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:36,239
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that.
I feel... I'm sorry I caused that.

371
00:19:36,307 --> 00:19:37,433
It's Andy's fault.

372
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:40,500
Well, yeah. Yes. So...
But I still feel sorry.

373
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:49,052
You know what? I wouldn't
worry about Angela. She's...

374
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,688
She doesn't hold
a candle to you, Erin.

375
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:55,816
She's old enough to be
your mom, for one thing,

376
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,623
and she's, like,
three feet tall,

377
00:20:01,432 --> 00:20:05,163
And she wears
pioneer women clothing,

378
00:20:05,235 --> 00:20:09,194
and I don't think she's
ever pooped in her life.

379
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:15,109
And Andy? You know... Come on. Andy,
his butt looks big in those khakis.

380
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:17,147
Oh, I like his butt.

381
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,311
You said butt.

382
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:21,646
You tricked me.

383
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:27,618
You'd love...

384
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,888
This... This guy in my
neighborhood, Tom Dizemore.

385
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:34,994
This is him.
"Hey! Hey, Scott..."

386
00:20:35,065 --> 00:20:39,001
<i>Sometimes telling
someone something is hard.</i>

387
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:44,634
Well, at least somebody made
her happy on Secretary's Day.

388
00:20:46,577 --> 00:20:49,444
<i>Hey, Kevin, it's Oscar.
I'm looking at the sheet you sent me,</i>

389
00:20:49,513 --> 00:20:51,606
<i>and I can't seem to find the
column for shipping costs...</i>

390
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:55,743
I made the most
brilliant retaliation video.

391
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:58,581
It is so awesome.

392
00:20:58,922 --> 00:21:00,446
I don't get it.

393
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,718
Yeah, I mean, the Count
has a very distinct voice.

394
00:21:02,793 --> 00:21:03,919
Thank you.

395
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,757
Yeah, "I want
to count to 10."

396
00:21:05,829 --> 00:21:06,818
Yeah.

397
00:21:06,897 --> 00:21:08,023
But Oscar is
an accountant,

398
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,293
and the Count
counts numbers.

399
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:12,130
You're an accountant,
too, so it doesn't...

400
00:21:12,202 --> 00:21:13,760
Why didn't you do
Oscar the Grouch?

401
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:15,395
That would have been funny.
That would have been funny.

402
00:21:15,472 --> 00:21:18,532
But the Count is purple,
and Oscar wears purple.

403
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:23,808
Oh! Oh! I was just watching
that. Did you do that, man? Oscar!

404
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:28,375
And the Count! Nailed him. Nailed
him! Good work, Cookie Monster.

405
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:29,916
Thank you.
