00:00:02,544 --> 00:00:06,547
Hello, my name is Oscar I'm an
accountant in Scranton, Pennsylvania

2
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:07,631
and I am gay

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:11,093
And I'm here to tell you
that, yes it does get better

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,303
When I was younger
What? What's he doing?

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,180
He's searching out
younger gays.

6
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,850
No, it's just a way
to tell young people

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,019
no matter how hard
it gets for them

8
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,311
there's a brighter
future ahead

9
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,604
With you

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,862
No matter how hard it gets for you...
Kelly, seriously, I...

11
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,281
Just keep chatting I'm just
checking my makeup in your webcam

12
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,699
Do you not own a mirror?

13
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:36,243
Webcams make me look the way
I look in my fantasies.

14
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:39,621
I know, right? What is it? You
always look so good in those things.

15
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:40,873
I'm throwing out
all my mirrors.

16
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:42,875
Okay, as you can see

17
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:45,502
at a dynamic workplace

18
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,548
Being gay is a celebration
of life It's a simple...

19
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:52,551
I'm sorry. I just
can't sit idly by

20
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:56,013
and have
the gay youth of America

21
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,556
misled by
some reductionist

22
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm not misleading

23
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,851
...pep talk

24
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,481
Sexuality is a spectrum

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:09,651
It's a paradox to think of any
sexual activity as normal

26
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:14,281
It gets better, but it also
gets vastly more complicated.

27
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:17,743
Hey, Robert? That guy
he looks just like you

28
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:20,829
Damn it! Kevin. God

29
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,459
You okay, Robert?

30
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,752
I'm fine

31
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,253
Put some ice on it

32
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,297
In any case,
it gets better

33
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:36,345
Maybe not much better
but better.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,180
It hurts

35
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:49,817
One, two, three

36
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,612
I wanted to give a nice gift to
the tenants in the building.

37
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,364
At first I thought,
"Muffin basket."

38
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:58,283
Then I thought, "What's even more
precious to people than muffins?"

39
00:01:58,368 --> 00:01:59,701
Can you just
smile, please?

40
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,122
Their own children

41
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,623
Hey, everybody

42
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,167
Just a few hours left for the
free family portrait studio.

43
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,503
Darryl, we'd love to see
little Jada come by

44
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:13,465
Angela, why don't you
bring by your little angel?

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,716
No, thank you

46
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,677
Jim, you've got
those two cute kids

47
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,053
We sure would
love to see them

48
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,222
doing this, Dwight

49
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,058
Last week, I may
have gone too far

50
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:24,810
I'll explain it quickly

51
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,312
Basically I found out where he
gets his clothes dry-cleaned

52
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,523
custom-ordered the same suit
made with tear-away Velcro

53
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,651
and you can
fill in the rest.

54
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,028
What?

55
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,365
Damn it, Jim

56
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,035
Now he's trying to get me to
bring my children into work

57
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,454
I think it's fair
to be cautious

58
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:48,083
Let me get this straight
you lost all of it?

59
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,422
All your winnings
$150,000?

60
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,343
You mean to tell me
no one wanted

61
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,137
an energy drink
for Asian homosexuals?

62
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
They did not

63
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,433
You've got
half-a-million of these?

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,230
Well, I've got to try it I wouldn't

65
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,024
Oh, come on.
What's the harm?

66
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,903
Hmm

67
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,821
What flavor is that?

68
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,409
The coconut's pretty subtle

69
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,870
Come on, man. Can you just
give us a yes or a no?

70
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:28,999
I don't know, man. You all
quit with a lot of confidence

71
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:33,170
came up in here dancing
and everybody was...

72
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,130
Ooh! Hold on a second

73
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,054
If I were Val, I would
break up with Brandon

74
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,306
Then I would date
the hell out of me

75
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,766
I wouldn't give in
to me too fast,

76
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,477
let me buy myself some
nice dinners and such

77
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,981
When I finally did give in
I would go crazy on myself

78
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:04,910
Hi, guys

79
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,995
How's it going, man?

80
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,332
I'm... I'm good
Thank you. How are you?

81
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,709
Great, yeah. Good

82
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,965
Oh, how the mediocre
have fallen.

83
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,593
Oh, God

84
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,887
Look, I'm not here
to get my old job back

85
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,556
I'm moving on

86
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:31,395
Just wanted to come in here
and literally beg you

87
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,605
for something, anything

88
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,275
water the plants.

89
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,484
No, you don't
Clean the toilets

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,278
Pull the poop
out of the toilets

91
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,154
Not even a thing.
Just please

92
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,698
Andy. Andy

93
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,616
Please give me something

94
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,704
Why don't you clean
the carpets for today?

95
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,539
Thank you

96
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,041
Well, you're...
Up you get, then

97
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,545
Pick yourself up

98
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,754
There it is.
Thank you

99
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,631
You don't need to

100
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,479
Good, good This carpet's
overdue for a good mopping

101
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,733
Is a mop the most efficient
too to use on a carpet?

102
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,609
Yeah, it is, actually

103
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,448
I can't hold
it in any longer

104
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,744
Because I convinced
David Wallace

105
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,246
to buy Dunder Mifflin
back from Sabre

106
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,499
and at 3:00 today he's
going to walk in here

107
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,377
and reinstate me
as manager

108
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,422
Family picture

109
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,592
Pam. No

110
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,261
What? Honey, we talked
about this.

111
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,513
No, we talked about
not bringing them

112
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,682
into Dwight's photo
studio/trap.

113
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,601
Yes, and then we decided
that was crazy.

114
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:55,270
No, we decided it was crazy
not to worry about it

115
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,356
No, we settled in a much
more rational place

116
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
remember?
No

117
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,692
We decided that there's no way
Dwight would harm a child

118
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,862
But are you 100% sure? I
don't think any of us are

119
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,030
No, no

120
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,114
Nope

121
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,784
But it's free and we'll
keep our eye on them

122
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,868
Yes
Yes, that's

123
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,870
And we will make sure that
Dwight doesn't do anything

124
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,205
Okay
...C-R-A-Z-Y

125
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,124
Wait. C-R-A-Z

126
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,126
Great, right up there

127
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,419
Yeah
Yeah.

128
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,129
You sit right here
one time.

129
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:22,547
There you go
Okay.

130
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,882
All right, why don't you
just give him to me?

131
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:25,217
Oh, great. Thank you

132
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,468
Perfect

133
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,261
This is great, excuse me

134
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,346
You ready? There you go

135
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,430
Okay.
All right, let's do it

136
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,765
I'll just stand here then

137
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,433
Yeah, just keep your eye
on Dwight Okay, yeah

138
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,768
Sir, could you
look into the camera?

139
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,478
Let's do it
Shoot it. Great

140
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,729
Sir.
Up here

141
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

142
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,067
Jim, right here right here.
Okay. Good

143
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,236
Oh, so that's it?
That's it

144
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,737
See, that wasn't so hard

145
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,239
Cute kids
Thanks for coming.

146
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:52,077
Hello, Erin.
Hello, everybody

147
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:54,913
What, why? Hi, honey.
What... How are you doing?

148
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,581
You know,
my office got a call

149
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,709
that they were shooting
family portraits right here

150
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,004
And if there's one thing every
politician instinctively understands

151
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,464
it's a good photo op

152
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,385
Okay, you're going to go
through the hallway.

153
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,846
Here's a map And if you get
lost just follow the blue line

154
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,141
Thanks

155
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,187
Well, well, well,
Senator Lipton. Welcome

156
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,730
Angela.
Dwight

157
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:21,815
Nice to see you

158
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,316
May I hold him?
Sure

159
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,195
No. I am going to hold him because
I haven't seen him all day.

160
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,365
I think that Dwight
is doing this whole thing

161
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,160
to get a sample
of my baby's DNA

162
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,036
to prove he's the father

163
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,039
Which is impossible

164
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,293
Because the Senator is the
only man I've ever been with

165
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,255
Did you see that?

166
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,174
What do you think
about that? See?

167
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,802
See that ducky?

168
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,929
Okay, hold on
a second, folks

169
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,598
A few of the baby's hairs
are out of place

170
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,475
Oh, thank you
No, no, no

171
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,226
I like the baby's hair
the way it is.

172
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
Really?

173
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,231
This is getting more and more
delicious by the minute.

174
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,450
It's go time

175
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,536
Hey, Nellie. I made... I made you

176
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,540
Well, I don't
want any soup

177
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,791
But it's really good

178
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,919
Oh! Come on, Andy

179
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,255
Ah

180
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,891
I know this is going
to be a great payoff

181
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,809
A delicious moment

182
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,520
But after you're manager

183
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,814
some of these images are
going to be hard to shake

184
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,817
Well, but it's
Just calibrate.

185
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,612
Okay? Calibrate

186
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,448
Okay, here we go

187
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,326
Oh, you know what? I don't want
to throw a wrench into the works

188
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,245
but I want everything
to be perfect

189
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,121
and the baby's fingernails
are just bothering me.

190
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,165
Uh-uh. Leave us alone

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,917
with the fingernails

192
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,961
Okay, great.
Suit yourself

193
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,339
Although

194
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,132
aren't those
excess skin cells

195
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,260
in the baby's cheek
distracting to you as well?

196
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,303
Dwight! We're fine

197
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:18,723
Oopsie! Did somebody
make a poopsie?

198
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,269
I'm just going to take
him out and change him

199
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:23,728
just for a second here

200
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,063
He defecated

201
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,147
Ooh
Oh

202
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:27,357
Stinky

203
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,360
A lot has changed
since you all left, okay?

204
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:32,654
You're going to have to
jump through some hoops

205
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,239
And the new foreman is here

206
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,617
Now, she's one of the best
we've ever known, okay?

207
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,203
So I need you to show her
your utmost respect

208
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,664
Make sure that
she feels welcome

209
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,624
and at home, okay?
Can you do that?

210
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,918
That's some pretty blatant
complimenting you're doing there, man

211
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,878
I don't even talk to her like that.
- Uh, Brandon

212
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,548
You would?
Yeah.

213
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:53,133
Sounds like you're trying
to hit on my girlfriend

214
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,426
Calm down. He's not

215
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,635
Yes, I am

216
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,346
Just so everyone's
on the same page.

217
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,515
So you really
think she's going to

218
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,975
leave a guy who owns
his own restaurant

219
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,019
for a dude who ate his own restaurant?
Brandon.

220
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,271
Good slam

221
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,397
Thank you, Biggie

222
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,607
Good luck to you

223
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,108
Oh, and have
a burger for me

224
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,115
Okay, shall we
take a few more?

225
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,993
I think we have all the shots
we need Thank you, Dwight

226
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,039
Okay, here we go
Yes, here we go.

227
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:38,011
No, Dwight! Give me
the diaper Dwight!

228
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,231
Is this what
you were looking for?

229
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,400
Huh? Huh?

230
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:56,655
Andy, we wanted
to talk to you.

231
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,741
A lot of us are very
concerned about you

232
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:05,205
You're dirty, you stink of booze,
you're limping inexplicably

233
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,165
I just want you guys
not to worry

234
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,125
because old Andy's
going to be just fine

235
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,919
No, no, no see, this is
what we're talking about

236
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:13,672
I mean, what was
that accent?

237
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,633
And last time I checked you were
drunk and now you're not drunk

238
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:21,388
No, unfortunately
it's true

239
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,473
He's been a nightmare

240
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,351
and the worst part is he's
been taking it out on me.

241
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,144
You hit her?
- What?

242
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,856
No, no
That is not the deal

243
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,067
Calibrate

244
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,613
He's not hitting me, but he's
been verbally abusing me

245
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:40,448
That is
not true, either

246
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:44,869
That's also total...
Everyone please relax

247
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,664
I think you're going to
like this surprise guest

248
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,252
Happy birthday to Gabe

249
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,295
Oh, get out,
Skeleton Man

250
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,260
someone to talk to

251
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,386
Huh?

252
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,054
Hold on

253
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:04,597
I'm just going to... Hello?

254
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,975
Hey, what's the scoop?
Are you close?

255
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:13,106
What? No, no, no, no, no, no,
no You have to come now.

256
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,403
Traffic clears.
No, next Friday

257
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:23,658
That's not going to work
Okay, yeah, okay

258
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,162
Damn it

259
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:31,583
Well, this is not going to be
quite as delicious as I wanted

260
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,586
but I do have a very tasty
announcement for you guys.

261
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,590
Not only am I not
a lowly janitor,

262
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,259
once again

263
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,094
Guys, I got
my old job back

264
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:45,638
Oh, boy
Oh, Andy

265
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:49,851
I'm not crazy I convinced David
Wallace to give me my job back

266
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,645
David Wallace hasn't
worked here in years.

267
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,731
Okay, yes
I see the confusion

268
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:56,483
at the fundraiser

269
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,318
He is now
a multi-millionaire

270
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,612
because he sold
his toy vacuum "Suck It'

271
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:02,030
to the U.S. Military

272
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,199
Andy, come on, man

273
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,993
I... Okay, I get how
that sounds crazy.

274
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:10,121
Andy, nobody's calling
you crazy, Andy.

275
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,790
We're your friends, Andy

276
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,082
Stop saying my name

277
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,168
No, he's not making this up.
Thank you, Erin

278
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,879
Andy tells me about seeing
David Wallace all the time

279
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:21,800
But have you ever
actually seen him yourself?

280
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,345
Oh, my God. Wait

281
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,180
Erin, come... Come on

282
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,141
You know I've been
talking to David Wallace

283
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,937
Do you see David Wallace
in the room right now?

284
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:46,199
Operation Phoenix is a go
Just get the car ready

285
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,952
Okay, you look at me
like you're adoring me

286
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:49,994
and I'm going to
look at the camera

287
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,079
like I don't even
know you're there

288
00:13:51,163 --> 00:13:52,497
But I do adore you

289
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,089
Andrew, it's time
for you to go home

290
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:03,883
You're better than this

291
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,010
Yeah, I know

292
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,387
Everyone is
better than this

293
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,599
Because this is the worst
thing I have ever seen

294
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,898
Why did they add coconut?
I miss original.

295
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,526
Hey.
- Hey

296
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,111
Hey, guys
- Hey

297
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,779
Hey, guys, long time

298
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,739
David, what are
you doing here?

299
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:28,783
Is it true you're
buying the company?

300
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:31,828
Okay, I guess
the word is out

301
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:36,207
Please keep this a secret but
yes, I've been talking with Andy.

302
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:39,210
What? I thought
I heard my name. What?

303
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,462
I'm the new manager?

304
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,922
I'll get to that
in a second, Andy

305
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,800
But it's
It is me? Right?

306
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,968
Yes
as we discussed

307
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,136
What?

308
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,305
Oh, my God

309
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,806
It's very possible
Probable.

310
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,558
Wow. From janitor
to manager?

311
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,642
Yep

312
00:14:55,269 --> 00:15:00,148
It's quite a Cinderella story.
From M-O-P to MVP

313
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,234
There's an official
announcement A few details...

314
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,946
From total loss
to total boss. I mean

315
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,990
Can we expect
any payroll interruptions?

316
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,867
Now that is
a great question, Stanley

317
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,243
Right now I think
all your operations

318
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,746
or most of your operations are
pretty much down in Florida,

319
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,914
so the shift back

320
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:21,085
I was so looking forward
to that and it did not go

321
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,129
as I thought it would

322
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,607
So we're not going to be
a part of Sabre anymore?

323
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,734
Actually nothing is going to
be a part of Sabre anymore

324
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,278
Jo Bennett's planning on liquidating
the rest of the company

325
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,864
Oof!

326
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:53,201
Wouldn't want to be a Sabre
employee right about now.

327
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,038
I'm actually the CEO

328
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:58,498
Ah

329
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,958
I didn't realize
you were standing there

330
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,334
Hey, my friend, trust me

331
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:04,796
This is for the best I never
understood that corporate mess

332
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,798
Well, okay.
Well, great to meet you

333
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,841
Likewise, I'm Bob
Bob Kazamakis.

334
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,385
Pleasure

335
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,387
I'd love to give you
a little rundown

336
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,180
on what I've learned
about this place.

337
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,848
That's very
gracious of you, Bob

338
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,642
Please

339
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,525
I guess I better
take off these dirty rags

340
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,071
and figure out how to be
a manager of this place.

341
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,281
Perhaps your
year of experience

342
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,158
managing this branch
will come in handy.

343
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,410
Gosh, I hope so

344
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,959
No! God, Mose. God

345
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,168
Hi, Angela

346
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,337
Get out of the car
Get out!

347
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,216
Where is he? Where is he?

348
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,343
I'm not supposed to say
Yes, tell me!

349
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:53,678
Tell me where he is

350
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,182
Mose! Damn it
Where did he go?

351
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,268
Mose, get back here

352
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:04,939
See that smile

353
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,529
Jump in here
Come on

354
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:39,474
Looks like I might get my
delicious moment after all.

355
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,809
May I say one thing?

356
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:46,773
It would be rude of me not to let
you say whatever's on your mind

357
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,818
"The quality of mercy
is not strained.'

358
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,904
No

359
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:57,325
"It dropeth as the gentle rain from
heaven upon the place beneath."

360
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,661
Do not bring Shakespeare
into this

361
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,081
How dare you play
the "Bard Card."

362
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,751
"It blesseth he who gives
and he who takes.

363
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:09,170
"'Tis mightiest
in the mightiest.'

364
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,841
one mother *
delicious moment.

365
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,511
Is that too much to ask?

366
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,559
If I were to
hire you back, if

367
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,647
what do you think
you would do well?

368
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:30,525
Special projects manager
That's my background.

369
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,568
Doing whatever I want

370
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,322
All right, you sly bastard
when can you start?

371
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,376
Okay, everyone

372
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,420
with Bob

373
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,549
and since I am going to be CEO
now, there'll be no need for him

374
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,218
Ouch! That's got to hurt

375
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,263
But he is going to make so much
money from the liquidation,

376
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,430
he's going to be
freed up to do

377
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,224
something much more important.
What?

378
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:08,980
David has generously offered to
donate $1,000,000 in matching funds

379
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,233
to a cause
that's very dear to me

380
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:15,945
So for the next three years
I'll be traveling overseas,

381
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,324
concentrating all of my efforts
on educating, mentoring

382
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:25,454
some African, some Asian, but
mainly Eastern European women

383
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,540
I had no idea
how pervasive

384
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,083
this problem was until
Bob explained it to me

385
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,044
Oprah Winfrey's
Leadership Academy

386
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:35,923
and other schools like it while
wonderful, end with high school.

387
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:38,259
I want to see these girls
right through college.

388
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,178
Especially the gymnasts

389
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:45,850
They've lost so many years
of crucial education

390
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,435
to perfecting their bodies

391
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,104
Muscle groups the rest
of us can't even fathom

392
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:54,692
Gymnasts? You're going to
seek out uneducated gymnasts?

393
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:59,864
Yeah. So I'm hoping to identify
some truly exceptional women

394
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,283
who show great promise

395
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,161
Well, Andy, it's been fun

396
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,454
Hmm

397
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,131
It's been a great year

398
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,349
Hello
Where is it?

399
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,393
They're testing it now

400
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,103
How long does it take
to get the results?

401
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,563
Seventy-two hours

402
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,981
You're going to wait here?

403
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,108
Yes

404
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,127
Dwight, I can't do this
Dwight

405
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,849
Hey
Senator Lipton.

406
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,059
Hey, how are you?

407
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,185
You didn't call

408
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,979
Um

409
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:15,815
Well, the issue
that concerned me

410
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,525
You know what
this is about.

411
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:19,860
Call
