1
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:09,908
Happy Halloween, everyone.

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,011
Oh, that's great.
Hey.

3
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:13,879
Happy Halloween.

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,647
Jan called.

5
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,951
O...kay.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,988
I know why she's calling.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,223
It's the end of the month,

8
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,958
and I was supposed
to let somebody go

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,726
by the end of the month.

10
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:31,563
And somehow I'm supposed
to put on a costume and smile.

11
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,601
Okay.

12
00:00:35,603 --> 00:00:37,002
Jan Levinson's office.

13
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:39,171
Hey, Sherri,
Michael Scott returning.

14
00:00:39,173 --> 00:00:40,606
Oh, she's in a meeting.

15
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,475
She just wanted the name
of the employee you let go.

16
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:45,277
Well, I'm gonna wait 'til
the end of the day.

17
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,746
Because the book said it's best
to wait 'til the end of the day.

18
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:50,215
I just need the name of who
you're planning to let go.

19
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,385
I..don't... know... yet.

20
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:55,120
I will have to call her back.

21
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,223
I know she wanted the name.

22
00:00:58,225 --> 00:00:59,658
Okay, Sherri?

23
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,160
Yeah?

24
00:01:01,162 --> 00:01:04,997
If you were getting fired,
how would you wanna be told

25
00:01:04,999 --> 00:01:06,498
so that you could
still be friends

26
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,200
with the person firing you?

27
00:01:09,836 --> 00:01:12,171
Jan wants the name as soon
as possible, Michael.

28
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,106
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

29
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,040
I'll call her back.

30
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,478
Wish I could fire Sherri.

31
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,280
Hey, I'm still here.
Okay.

32
00:01:21,282 --> 00:01:22,781
I'm sorry.
Yeah.

33
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:23,982
No?
Okay.

34
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:26,285
Bye.
Hanging up now.

35
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:05,791
I mean, you hear
about layoffs in the news,

36
00:02:05,793 --> 00:02:07,626
but when you actually have
to do it yourself,

37
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:09,428
it is heavy stuff.

38
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,996
It's...

39
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:14,166
I mean, these are people's lives
you're talking about.

40
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:16,034
You wanted me?
Yes.

41
00:02:23,343 --> 00:02:25,444
Papier-mâché?
Yes.

42
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:27,479
Yesh.
Hmm.

43
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:32,351
Um, Pam I have
to let somebody go today.

44
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:35,354
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.

45
00:02:35,356 --> 00:02:37,556
Why did you put it off
until Halloween?

46
00:02:37,558 --> 00:02:40,025
Because it's very scary stuff.

47
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:42,294
Well, I think it's gonna put
a damper on the party a little.

48
00:02:42,296 --> 00:02:43,829
You're worried about the party?

49
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,164
There's a man's
life at stake here.

50
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,932
So it's a man?
No.

51
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,135
Or a woman.
A human life.

52
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:52,237
If you had to guess,

53
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,974
who would it be,
based on their job performance?

54
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:57,943
And who do you think
deserves to be fired?

55
00:02:57,945 --> 00:02:58,944
Who would that be?

56
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,713
I just answer the phone.

57
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,817
And sometimes you just let
it go to voice mail.

58
00:03:12,258 --> 00:03:14,927
Your costume is fantastic.

59
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,829
I know.

60
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:20,732
I sent away for it
in July from a catalog.

61
00:03:22,102 --> 00:03:24,269
Oh, no.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

62
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,571
Aah.

63
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,706
Okay.

64
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:32,144
Oh, man.
Okay, I have to fire somebody.

65
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:38,483
What is that?
What are you supposed to be?

66
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,321
I'm a three-hole punch
version of Jim.

67
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,789
'Cause he can have me
either way.

68
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,225
Plain white Jim,
or three-hole punch.

69
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:49,027
- That's great.
- Oh, yeah.

70
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:51,930
Yeah, well, look.
What about me?

71
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,603
What are you?
A monk?

72
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:59,938
I am a Sith Lord.

73
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:03,775
Oh, big deal.

74
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:06,745
Three round pieces of paper
taped to his shirt.

75
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,648
This cost me $129.

76
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,483
Ass.

77
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,390
Hey, you guys excited
about the party?

78
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,893
It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.

79
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:25,063
Oh, look at you.
Showing your colors.

80
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,199
Bet you wish you wore
a dress every day.

81
00:04:27,201 --> 00:04:28,500
What are you implying?

82
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,602
All good.
Happy Halloween.

83
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,338
What happened to all those
spooky decorations that we had?

84
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,008
The cobwebs and such?

85
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,377
I don't know.
We put them all up last night.

86
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,016
Well, you know what?
Go buy some more.

87
00:04:44,018 --> 00:04:45,417
I'll approve the overages.

88
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,052
Sound good?
Yeah.

89
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,820
Good.

90
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:52,057
Oh, yeah, also,
about budget stuff,

91
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,193
um, I need you to find,
like a...

92
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,096
a full employee salary
plus benefits, like 50 grand.

93
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,633
I'm gonna need you to find
50 grand in the numbers.

94
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,502
But we don't keep two cents...

95
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,003
Well, that's not
what I'm saying.

96
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:06,271
Just, you know, find it.

97
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:09,107
Pretend that your
jobs depend on it.

98
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,782
Mmm-hm-hmm.

99
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,418
Interesting take on Dorothy.
I love it.

100
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,019
Hey, you know what would
even be better?

101
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,888
Soccer ball and cleats.

102
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:24,389
Why is that?

103
00:05:24,391 --> 00:05:25,657
Bend It Like Beckham.

104
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:27,726
Oh, like, the movie
about the Indian girl

105
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,461
who plays soccer?

106
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,829
Yeah.

107
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,531
That would be perfect.

108
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:35,300
Yeah, I mean, I guess
I could do that.

109
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:37,836
I don't really play soccer
or anything.

110
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,672
Well, I don't really
have two heads, so.

111
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,408
Wait, what are you again?
Oh, right.

112
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,910
Three-hole punch!

113
00:05:48,248 --> 00:05:50,682
Okay, greatest strength.

114
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:52,751
Okay, okay.

115
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,853
A doglike obedience
to authority.

116
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:55,654
Nice.

117
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:58,924
That doesn't sound good.
Okay, okay.

118
00:05:58,926 --> 00:06:02,728
Um, how 'bout
the ultimate team player?

119
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:04,930
Dwight is special,

120
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,866
but I don't believe that his
talents are being used

121
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:09,267
in this office.

122
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,503
So Pam and I have put his résumé

123
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:15,006
on monster.com, Google,
craigslist.

124
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:17,676
We're really interested
most in jobs

125
00:06:17,678 --> 00:06:19,444
that take Dwight out of state.

126
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,347
Um, preferably Alaska.
Or India.

127
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,883
He's a gun nut.
Mmm.

128
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:27,686
Sticks to his guns.

129
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,722
Well, I looked through
all the budgets.

130
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,491
And there is one department...
Yes?

131
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,092
That has three people...
Yeah?

132
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:36,294
Doing the work that could
be done by two.

133
00:06:36,296 --> 00:06:37,396
This is great.

134
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:41,800
Oh.

135
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:46,171
Yeah. Oh.

136
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:48,306
Who do you think it should be?
Jim, definitely.

137
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:49,608
No, Jim brings in money.

138
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,443
Phyllis.
Eh.

139
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:55,213
Stanley. Pam.
Oscar. Meredith.

140
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,849
Kevin. Angela.

141
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,651
It's not a popularity contest.

142
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,621
Although it does make sense
to fire the least popular,

143
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:06,558
because it has the least
effect on morale.

144
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,460
One of the warehouse guys.

145
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,163
What?

146
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:13,598
There was someone
left off that list?

147
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
Who?
Who is he saying?

148
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,771
You're right.
I didn't even think of him.

149
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,840
No, Michael.

150
00:07:21,842 --> 00:07:23,675
Yeah, that's actually
a really good idea.

151
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,645
No, not me.
Yeah, I could.

152
00:07:26,647 --> 00:07:28,146
Not Dwight.

153
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:29,614
I'm not saying
that's what he said.

154
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,550
I know that's what he said.

155
00:07:31,552 --> 00:07:32,651
What?

156
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:35,287
Tell him not Dwight.

157
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,589
That is not a very nice
thing to say about him.

158
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:39,324
Tell him to stop.
Are you kidding?

159
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,525
Quiet you.

160
00:07:40,527 --> 00:07:42,294
I agree.
He'd land on his feet.

161
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,029
Make him be quiet.

162
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,167
Those aren't chips and dip.

163
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:51,436
No, I made brownies.

164
00:07:52,873 --> 00:07:54,539
What?

165
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,275
I'm just trying to figure out
why you're sabotaging things.

166
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,611
I made brownies.

167
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:03,081
And I made cookies.
Same category.

168
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,520
I'm guessing Angela's the one
in the neighborhood

169
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:13,758
who gives the trick-or-treaters
some toothbrushes.

170
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,094
Pennies.

171
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:17,996
Walnuts.

172
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,832
Dunder-Mifflin,
this is Pam.

173
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,868
Uh, yeah.

174
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,136
Just one second.

175
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:28,540
I will transfer you
to our manager, Michael Scott.

176
00:08:34,548 --> 00:08:36,681
Michael Scott here.

177
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:41,253
Yes, I am regional manager
of this orifice.

178
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:43,288
Mmm-hmm.

179
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:46,424
Dwight Schrute is amazing.

180
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:48,059
Yeah.

181
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,996
No, he is actually the single
greatest employee

182
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:52,998
of his generation.

183
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,533
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,101
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what.

185
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:58,603
You hire Dwight K. Schrute,

186
00:08:58,605 --> 00:09:00,805
and he does not meet, nay,

187
00:09:00,807 --> 00:09:05,143
exceed every one
of your wildest expectations,

188
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,279
well, then you can hold me,

189
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:09,948
Michael Gary Scott,

190
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,651
personally and financially
responsible.

191
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,653
Okay. Okay.

192
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,721
Okay-kay-kay-kay.

193
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,056
Okay.

194
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,764
Stanley, could you come
with me, please.

195
00:09:25,766 --> 00:09:27,265
No.

196
00:09:30,436 --> 00:09:32,304
As assistant regional manager...

197
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:34,205
To the...
Look.

198
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:36,308
I've got some bad news.

199
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,442
You're fired.

200
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,311
You need to pack up
your things and go.

201
00:09:39,313 --> 00:09:41,846
I'm serious, Stanley.

202
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:44,115
It's over, I'm sorry.

203
00:09:44,117 --> 00:09:45,984
You're fired.

204
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,852
Get your fingers off my phone.

205
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:56,027
So, how did it go with Stanley?

206
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,596
How... how'd he take it?

207
00:09:57,598 --> 00:09:59,564
He wouldn't listen to me.
Oh, come on.

208
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:01,866
If you wanna fire him, you're
gonna have to tell him yourself.

209
00:10:01,868 --> 00:10:04,035
I don't wanna fire Stanley.
I never said that.

210
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:06,972
I'm certainly not going
to do it myself.

211
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,408
Get those big, baleful
eyes staring at me.

212
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,943
Yikes.

213
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,478
Okay, just...

214
00:10:14,814 --> 00:10:17,415
Cumberland Mills?

215
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:20,218
And how did you get my résumé?

216
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,153
Oh, no, no.
I'm very flattered.

217
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:23,622
Don't get me wrong.

218
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:26,324
I'm just not sure
that it's my official résumé,

219
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,361
or if it's something that maybe

220
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,931
a satisfied customer
posted online.

221
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:36,434
What does it say under
martial arts training?

222
00:10:37,737 --> 00:10:39,871
Oh, okay, I'm gonna have
to supplement that.

223
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:42,440
Could I have your fax number?

224
00:10:42,442 --> 00:10:44,409
Would I ever leave this company?

225
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:46,211
Look, I'm all about loyalty.

226
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:47,679
In fact, I feel like

227
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:51,182
part of what I'm getting
paid for here is my loyalty.

228
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:52,651
But if there were somewhere else

229
00:10:52,653 --> 00:10:55,220
that valued that loyalty
more highly,

230
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:59,658
I'm going wherever
they value loyalty the most.

231
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:04,262
Oh, hey.

232
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:06,931
Oh, your dress is stuck
in the back.

233
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:09,801
Oh.

234
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,406
So you got the fax?

235
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,775
So why didn't you add it
to the res...

236
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:18,043
What do you mean?

237
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,511
Of course martial arts training
is relevant.

238
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,179
Oh, excuse me.

239
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,915
I know about a billion Asians
that would beg to differ.

240
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,785
Uh, yeah, I get
a little frustrated

241
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,420
when I'm dealing
with incompetence.

242
00:11:28,422 --> 00:11:30,155
Well, you know what?
You can go to hell too.

243
00:11:30,157 --> 00:11:32,624
And I will see you there...
burning.

244
00:11:32,626 --> 00:11:34,392
Fine. Okay, wait.

245
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:36,928
So you'll let me know
when you've made a decis...

246
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,668
Jim is really talented.

247
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:47,439
And he should be the one who's
getting a better job offer.

248
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:48,473
Like, for real.

249
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:50,041
Don't take this the wrong way,

250
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:53,478
but you should go for that job.

251
00:11:56,615 --> 00:12:00,318
Um, it's in Maryland.

252
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,020
Yeah.

253
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,621
But, I mean, look at the salary.

254
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,057
And it's definitely a step up.

255
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,526
And a challenge.

256
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,863
Yeah.

257
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,769
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe...

258
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,572
Maybe I will.

259
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,743
Jim...

260
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:30,415
This is called leveraging
an offer.

261
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:33,852
Michael, can I talk to you
for a moment? Oh, God.

262
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,653
I just thought you should know

263
00:12:35,655 --> 00:12:39,457
that I was just offered
a job with better pay,

264
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:43,161
better benefits and a better
title at Cumberland Mills.

265
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,496
Fantastic.

266
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,730
And I turned it down.

267
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:48,299
What? That would've
solved all my problems.

268
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,769
Out of loyalty
to this company...

269
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:52,370
Oh, you idiot.

270
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:55,073
So I was hoping to be made
assistant regional manager.

271
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,909
If you left,
I wouldn't have to fire anybody.

272
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,377
But then you wouldn't
have me here.

273
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,113
Big deal, oh, it would've
worked out so well.

274
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,414
Can you get it back?

275
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:04,482
It's in Maryland.

276
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,917
You can call.
Can you call 'em?

277
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,820
I can't... I... I suppose I... no.

278
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,588
They never really made me
an offer anyway.

279
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,125
Why are you torturing me?

280
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,260
God.

281
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,198
Honestly, I don't think that
Michael has the slightest clue

282
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,933
of who he's going to fire.

283
00:13:21,935 --> 00:13:24,102
I think he keeps hoping that
someone's going to volunteer.

284
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:27,839
Uh, or be run over
by a bus before the deadline.

285
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,674
But in the end,
really what's going to happen is

286
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:31,409
it's gonna be the first
person to give him

287
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,644
a dirty look in the hall.

288
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,148
And therein lies the true
essence of his charisma.

289
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,919
Can I speak to you a minute?

290
00:13:40,921 --> 00:13:42,854
Um... yes.

291
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:08,746
Michael, I really
didn't mean to...

292
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,815
Help me.

293
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,183
I'm sorry?

294
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:14,352
I want you to role
play firing me.

295
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,288
I want you to fire me,
and I will take it.

296
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,857
Oh, you want me to be you? Yes.

297
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,025
I want you to be me,
and I will be Creed.

298
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:22,727
Oh, are you firing Creed?
No, no.

299
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:26,664
No, that's just first... thing.
Can't... in head.

300
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,900
We should switch seats
in order to...

301
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,035
Yes, that's a good idea.

302
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:33,771
Excuse me.

303
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:41,012
I'm really sorry,
but I have to let you go.

304
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,214
And it's purely budgetary.

305
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,883
It's not personal...

306
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,685
I'm gonna kill myself!

307
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:48,820
Wow.

308
00:14:48,822 --> 00:14:50,488
I'm going to kill myself!

309
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,856
And it's your fault!

310
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,358
That's an overreaction.

311
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,127
Corporate is really
breathing down my neck.

312
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,129
And they're saying
this has to be done

313
00:14:58,131 --> 00:14:59,597
by the end of the month.

314
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:01,766
Is this you? Are you being you,
or is this Creed?

315
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:05,870
I... this is Creed.

316
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,206
Okay. I'm improvising,
so just try to keep up.

317
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,774
And I'm very angry.

318
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:11,376
Hold that thought.
Creed?

319
00:15:11,378 --> 00:15:13,544
Michael Scott here. I'm gonna
kill you for firing me.

320
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,013
Toby? Mmm-hmm?

321
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:17,215
I really have to take this,
Creed, so it was really worth...

322
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:20,084
Get off, get off.
No, no.

323
00:15:25,524 --> 00:15:28,493
Just, just... yeah.

324
00:15:29,663 --> 00:15:31,663
What happened?

325
00:15:31,665 --> 00:15:33,398
It wasn't me.
Oh.

326
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,899
That was, like, crazy.

327
00:15:34,901 --> 00:15:36,167
I know.
'Cause I was...

328
00:15:45,577 --> 00:15:47,412
Uh, hey, Creed?

329
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:48,579
Huh?

330
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,281
Could I talk to you
for a second?

331
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:57,655
You are great.

332
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:59,490
Very ambitious.

333
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,726
And I feel like you want more

334
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:03,962
than this little office
has to offer.

335
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:07,398
And I understand that you'd
wanna just spread your wings

336
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,300
and fly the coop.

337
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:13,938
We're gonna have to...
You... you want something better.

338
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,941
No, I don't.
I wanna stay right here.

339
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,476
No, you wanna leave.

340
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,411
No, I wanna stay here.

341
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:22,246
Why are you making this so hard?

342
00:16:22,248 --> 00:16:24,148
I think there's
a misunderstanding, Michael.

343
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,416
I think you're right.

344
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:28,319
Can I go?
No, of course, you can't go.

345
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,390
We haven't even started
this horrible process of...

346
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,559
Okay, Creed,

347
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:39,297
I need to let somebody go today.

348
00:16:39,299 --> 00:16:42,266
They told me I need
to let somebody go.

349
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,535
And as much as I think
you're a great guy,

350
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:48,506
and I like you,
you're... you're, good-bye.

351
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,108
Let's fight it.

352
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,409
Hmm?

353
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:52,910
Let's call Jan,
and fight this thing together

354
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,112
like the old days.

355
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,513
What old days?
What are you talking about?

356
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,181
Did you start the paperwork yet?

357
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,983
It's right here
on the desk, yeah.

358
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,385
You don't have to do this,
Michael.

359
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:02,420
I can't...
Undo it!

360
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:03,921
I can't change anything.

361
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,723
No, you have the power
to undo it.

362
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,225
You undo it.

363
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:09,494
Michael, undo it.

364
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:10,995
Yeah, I went hunting once.

365
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,964
Shot the deer in the leg.

366
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,833
Had to kill it with a shovel.
Took about an hour.

367
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:17,035
Why do you ask?

368
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:19,070
I have to fire someone today.

369
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:20,972
Okay?
Fine.

370
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:24,809
Fire someone else.
Fire Devon, he's terrible.

371
00:17:24,811 --> 00:17:27,578
I am so much better
at my job than Devon.

372
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,547
Okay, well,
I already picked you.

373
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,915
And you know that.

374
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,184
So, unless I just
go through with this,

375
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,154
you're always gonna look at me
as the guy who almost fired you.

376
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:38,990
No, no, no, no, no.
I will forget so fast.

377
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:40,324
You will be my savior.

378
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:44,262
You're the guy who
gave me my life back.

379
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,863
Thank you.

380
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:47,865
I knew you'd see my way,
Michael, God bless you.

381
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,700
You're a fine man.
Don't...

382
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,369
Listen, you will not regret
this either.

383
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:53,337
Devon's terrible.
No one's gonna miss him.

384
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,008
Good, good, good.

385
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,527
Devon, could I talk
to you for a sec?

386
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:19,030
Creed's an idiot. You know that.
Well, he...

387
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:21,666
No, no, no, no, no.
You had it right the first time.

388
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:23,768
Well, maybe I did.
Exactly.

389
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,903
You gotta go with you gut, man.

390
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,738
Huh. Well...

391
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,341
No, I can't...
No.

392
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:32,276
I can't go back.
I would look like an idiot.

393
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,145
That's why I'm being fired?
No.

394
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,980
So you might not look
like an idiot? No.

395
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,849
It was all
the stuff that I said.

396
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,485
It was the business downturn,
the cutbacks, and, and...

397
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,253
This is unbelievable!

398
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:45,723
I just hope that you
and I can remain friends.

399
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,394
Devon, wait... please.

400
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:52,864
Look, look.

401
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:56,567
In addition to severance,
and everything,

402
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:58,903
I want to give you

403
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,040
this gift certificate
to Chili's.

404
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:04,509
From me.

405
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,745
Okay? No hard feelings.

406
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,751
Kevin, Jim, Pam, Kelly,

407
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,187
Toby, Oscar, Meredith,

408
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,489
Phyllis, Stanley, or the temp.

409
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,491
If any of you wanna meet me
for a drink,

410
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,026
I'm gonna be at Poor Richard's.

411
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:24,862
And the rest of you
can go to hell.

412
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,804
What about the Halloween party?

413
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:39,744
Oh, hey, Jim.
Wait, stop.

414
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,647
Um, I'm sorry

415
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:45,349
for pushing you
toward Cumberland.

416
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,121
Seriously, if you left here,
I would blow my brains out.

417
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,024
Come on.

418
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,427
That's just a figure
of speech, you know?

419
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,262
Blow your brains out?
Come on.

420
00:19:58,264 --> 00:20:00,565
All it really means
is that we're friends.

421
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,767
I mean, who else
is she gonna talk to

422
00:20:02,769 --> 00:20:04,802
if I'm gone, right?

423
00:20:04,804 --> 00:20:07,338
I mean, if she left I wouldn't
blow my brains out.

424
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,208
Of course, I would take
that job in Maryland.

425
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:12,076
Because it's double the pay,

426
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:16,247
and soft shell crab just happens
to be my favorite food.

427
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,956
I love Halloween.

428
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,657
You, know it's just...
it's just fun.

429
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:28,726
Every year, it's just fun.

430
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,529
Last Halloween,
I came as Janet Jackson's boob.

431
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:34,532
It was topical.

432
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:36,300
People got a big kick out of it.

433
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:40,104
The year before that,
I came as Monica Lewinsky.

434
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,573
And I wore a stained dress.

435
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:45,610
The year before that,
I also came as Monica Lewinsky.

436
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,845
And before that,
I was O.J.

437
00:20:47,847 --> 00:20:49,747
It was pretty funny.

438
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:51,649
Oh, I wish you were here
last year.

439
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,193
Trick or treat!

440
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:03,628
Hey!

441
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,996
How you doin'? Wow!

442
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,631
You guys look great.

443
00:21:06,633 --> 00:21:08,132
I'm a bumblebee.

444
00:21:08,134 --> 00:21:10,034
You look great.

445
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:11,602
And you're a princess?

446
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,271
A fairy princess.

447
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,273
You're very...
I'm a lion.

448
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:16,941
You're a lion.
Wow, I want to hear your...

449
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,676
Oh, okay, that's all yours.
That's all yours.

450
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:20,211
Grab it, grab it.
You know what?

451
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,747
You guys are getting
all of these.
