1
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:05,861
Okay.

2
00:00:05,937 --> 00:00:07,336
Breathe.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:09,004
Work your core!

4
00:00:09,074 --> 00:00:10,439
Come on.

5
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:12,600
How many is that?

6
00:00:12,677 --> 00:00:14,269
Not counting
the last one, 25.

7
00:00:14,346 --> 00:00:15,335
Count the last one.

8
00:00:15,414 --> 00:00:17,041
Okay, 25 and
one girl pushup.

9
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:18,707
Oh, new record!

10
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:20,217
Okay.
Oh!

11
00:00:20,285 --> 00:00:21,513
What did you do today?

12
00:00:21,586 --> 00:00:22,610
I made a sale.

13
00:00:22,687 --> 00:00:25,656
Oh, yeah,
sitting on your big fat butt.

14
00:00:25,724 --> 00:00:27,692
All right, that is
the number to beat.

15
00:00:28,293 --> 00:00:29,692
What do we get
if we do them?

16
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:31,126
My respect.

17
00:00:34,099 --> 00:00:35,726
Okay, I'll make it
a little more interesting.

18
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:37,632
Anyone who does
more than 25 pushups...

19
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:38,794
And one girl pushup.

20
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,497
...gets to go home.

21
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:46,911
I say "dance,"
they say "how high?"

22
00:00:46,978 --> 00:00:48,445
Three, four...

23
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:51,676
Here we go.
No, no, no, butt too high.

24
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,842
Disqualified!

25
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:54,044
What do we got?
Creed, disqualified.

26
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,552
Oh, come on!

27
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,882
Nineteen.

28
00:01:00,225 --> 00:01:02,159
I had a really hard
workout this morning.

29
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:07,222
Oh, wow!
That is adorable!

30
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,424
- Ten.
- Yeah!

31
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,596
I'm betting one more.

32
00:01:13,672 --> 00:01:14,764
Eleven.

33
00:01:16,575 --> 00:01:18,702
Wow!
Good.

34
00:01:18,777 --> 00:01:23,043
Stanley! Stanley!
Stanley! Stanley! Stanley!

35
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,479
All right.
All right.

36
00:01:24,549 --> 00:01:26,176
Stanley!
Stanley! Stanley!

37
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,414
Essentially what we have
here is one of those stories

38
00:01:29,488 --> 00:01:32,582
where a mother lifts
a car to save her baby.

39
00:01:33,091 --> 00:01:34,683
Well, it's not exactly fair.

40
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,887
He's got all this weight
that's helping him go down.

41
00:01:37,963 --> 00:01:39,954
- Twenty-five!
- Come on!

42
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,828
One more! One more, Stanley!
Yeah, come on! You can do it.

43
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,889
Come on, Stanley!
Let's do it. Come on.

44
00:01:42,968 --> 00:01:43,957
Go!

45
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:45,161
Yes!

46
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,005
Yes!
- Yeah!

47
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,201
- Are you okay?
- Very nicely done.

48
00:01:54,279 --> 00:01:56,144
Are you okay, Stanley?

49
00:01:57,415 --> 00:01:58,746
Excuse me.

50
00:02:03,088 --> 00:02:04,146
Wow.

51
00:02:07,092 --> 00:02:08,889
All right,
Papa Bear.

52
00:02:34,286 --> 00:02:35,344
Hey!

53
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,245
Matt, right?

54
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,313
Hey, Oscar.
You're here early.

55
00:02:39,824 --> 00:02:42,315
No.
I always come in at 7:00.

56
00:02:42,394 --> 00:02:43,383
No you don't.

57
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:44,450
Well...

58
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:47,529
Hey, are you doing
anything later tonight?

59
00:02:47,732 --> 00:02:48,926
I don't know. I'm free.

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,366
If you hear of anything
going on, let me know.

61
00:02:51,436 --> 00:02:52,460
Yeah.

62
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:53,799
Yeah, we talked this morning,

63
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,931
and we talked at Christmas,

64
00:02:56,007 --> 00:02:58,032
so a little momentum there.

65
00:03:04,015 --> 00:03:06,540
Couple hours to kill
before work.

66
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,485
Hey, what's up?
Hey.

67
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:12,979
Nice office.

68
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,889
Thanks. It's cool.

69
00:03:20,899 --> 00:03:22,025
So...

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,559
You know what we haven't
done in a while?

71
00:03:25,136 --> 00:03:26,330
Happy hour.

72
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:30,938
Upstairs, the warehouse, everybody
just going out for a drink.

73
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:34,376
Has that ever
happened? Ever?

74
00:03:34,446 --> 00:03:35,743
Didn't we?
I think we did.

75
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:38,507
Want me to invite Matt?

76
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:40,983
Yeah, the whole gang.
Matt included.

77
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:44,051
Look, just be straight
with me, man.

78
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:47,182
You can be gay with Matt,
just be straight with me.

79
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,158
So, happy hour.
Happy hour.

80
00:03:49,227 --> 00:03:50,592
Just invite everybody.

81
00:03:50,662 --> 00:03:51,686
My pleasure.

82
00:03:51,763 --> 00:03:53,094
All right.

83
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,998
So, what do you think?
- Hmm.

84
00:03:57,135 --> 00:03:59,433
I saw a new drink
on TV I'd like to try.

85
00:03:59,504 --> 00:04:00,630
I'll ask Bob.

86
00:04:00,705 --> 00:04:02,730
Yeah. I love going to bars with Bob.

87
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:04,502
I tend to wear
something low-cut,

88
00:04:04,576 --> 00:04:07,670
get men to flirt with
me, and Bob beats them up.

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,069
What?

90
00:04:10,448 --> 00:04:11,915
A bunch of us are talking
about happy hour.

91
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:15,248
I would love,
love, love to go.

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,412
Only problem is,

93
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:18,615
Pam's at home with the baby and
I think she wants a night in.

94
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,715
Oh, baloney.
Good one.

95
00:04:20,792 --> 00:04:22,054
Ring her up.

96
00:04:22,127 --> 00:04:23,719
Absolutely.
I'll do that right now.

97
00:04:23,795 --> 00:04:26,662
I gotta tell you,
this baby is amazing.

98
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:28,790
She gets me
out of everything.

99
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,901
And I love her.
I also love her very much.

100
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,938
So, some of
the coworkers

101
00:04:35,006 --> 00:04:36,837
were thinking of going out
tonight, but I told them...

102
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:38,967
<i>Yes! Yes,
I would love to!</i>

103
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,875
Knew it!

104
00:04:40,945 --> 00:04:42,879
<i>It's been so long since
I've been with adults.</i>

105
00:04:42,947 --> 00:04:44,938
<i>I'm so excited
to see everybody.</i>

106
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,382
<i>Creed, Ryan.
Oh, my God, Stanley!</i>

107
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:48,714
<i>Stanley's gonna be there.
Yes! Oh, my God...</i>

108
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,812
I did not
see this coming.

109
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:54,881
Erin, I need you to fax this and
get me a confirmation, pronto.

110
00:04:56,227 --> 00:04:57,660
Are you going later?

111
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,424
Sure, if you are.
Yes.

112
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:01,829
Talk to me that way again
and I'll cut your face off.

113
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,992
Whoa!

114
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:07,568
We recently struck up a
romantic relationship, and...

115
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,304
But we're kind of
keeping it quiet for now,

116
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,470
'cause it's still kind of a new
thing, it's a little delicate,

117
00:05:14,546 --> 00:05:17,481
and we just don't want
all the drama. Exactly.

118
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:20,575
Yeah, 'cause when everyone
knows, it...

119
00:05:32,731 --> 00:05:36,497
That's actually pretty funny,
but in general, you know...

120
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:39,963
Quiet.

121
00:05:40,171 --> 00:05:41,695
Hey, boss man.
- Yes.

122
00:05:41,773 --> 00:05:44,469
A bunch of us are going
to get some drinks. You in?

123
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:46,908
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is quitting time.

124
00:05:46,978 --> 00:05:48,809
I'm sorry,
I meant later.

125
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:50,439
Okay. Yes.
For happy hour?

126
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:51,607
Sure. No, I got that.

127
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:52,707
Trying to
get a head count.

128
00:05:52,784 --> 00:05:53,773
I am in!

129
00:05:53,852 --> 00:05:54,841
All right.

130
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,287
Yes. It's a deal.

131
00:05:57,355 --> 00:05:58,379
It's a deal.

132
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:01,889
Hey, I invited my friend Julie. Okay.

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,984
I want her
to meet Michael.

134
00:06:03,061 --> 00:06:04,085
Why?

135
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:05,561
They're both single. I
have a sense they might...

136
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,619
You've been
gone for a long time.

137
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,189
It is not that... Kevin!

138
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:11,098
Yeah!

139
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:12,492
How are you?

140
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,731
Oh, I missed you so much.
Oh!

141
00:06:14,806 --> 00:06:16,364
Yeah.

142
00:06:16,441 --> 00:06:17,465
Yeah.

143
00:06:26,084 --> 00:06:28,712
Well, when a new mom
hears a baby cry,

144
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,812
her you-know-whats
fill up with you know what,

145
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,983
and then her shirt gets,
you know...

146
00:06:34,058 --> 00:06:36,686
That would be funny.

147
00:06:38,196 --> 00:06:43,224
Oh, wow. I cannot believe this is
happening. This is everything I dreamed.

148
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:45,593
Oh, my God!

149
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,959
Hey!

150
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,630
Easy.

151
00:06:48,706 --> 00:06:51,402
It's not a birthday,
it's not a goodbye party.

152
00:06:51,476 --> 00:06:52,534
Hey, Pam and I
are gonna go play pool

153
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,078
with one of her friends,
and we need a fourth.

154
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,738
Sucks to be you.

155
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:00,715
Would you like
to be our fourth?

156
00:07:03,421 --> 00:07:04,615
That would be sublime.

157
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:05,849
All right.

158
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:10,120
So, the guy shows me
the deck he's built,

159
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:12,186
and I'm like, "I'll call this
a deck if it'll make you happy,

160
00:07:12,263 --> 00:07:14,697
"but this is just
a porch without a roof."

161
00:07:17,435 --> 00:07:18,697
It was
ridiculous, man.

162
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:22,069
It was, like, you could maybe
get two chairs on the thing.

163
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,698
Two lawn chairs.

164
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:26,201
Hey, Michael.
Yes?

165
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:27,266
This is my friend Julie.

166
00:07:27,345 --> 00:07:29,040
Hello. How are you?
Hi.

167
00:07:29,113 --> 00:07:31,911
What is a nice girl like you
hanging out with these bums for?

168
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:33,007
There you go.

169
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,416
Julie laughs
at everything.

170
00:07:36,554 --> 00:07:37,987
So you work
with Pam and Jim?

171
00:07:38,056 --> 00:07:40,820
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me,

172
00:07:40,892 --> 00:07:43,520
and if they win,
they are fired.

173
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,392
I should hope not.

174
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:49,797
No. No. Not really. Not
really. But they better not win.

175
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,263
Hey.
- Hey, Isabel, you made it.

176
00:07:52,337 --> 00:07:53,463
Oh, my goodness!
Of course.

177
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:55,233
You want to play pool?

178
00:07:55,306 --> 00:07:58,173
I'm gonna do a lap, see
if I know anyone. Okay.

179
00:07:58,243 --> 00:08:02,077
And then they said the most
ridiculous thing about Anderson Cooper,

180
00:08:02,146 --> 00:08:04,671
which I do not have
the decency to repeat,

181
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:06,341
but trust me when
I tell you that it...

182
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:08,078
Hold that thought.

183
00:08:09,153 --> 00:08:10,780
Well, well, well.

184
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,387
If it isn't Isabel.
Mmm-hmm.

185
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:16,427
What's a girl like you
doing in a place like this?

186
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:19,429
A girl like me is why a guy like
you comes to a place like this.

187
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:21,192
Ooh. I love repartee.

188
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:22,290
Do you?

189
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:24,426
Usually means there's
a battle scene coming.

190
00:08:27,171 --> 00:08:28,160
So what do you do?

191
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:29,797
I am an ESL teacher.

192
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:30,898
Really?
Yeah.

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,738
See, I didn't think
you could teach that.

194
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,278
I thought that was
something you were born with.

195
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:36,574
What am I thinking
right now?

196
00:08:36,648 --> 00:08:38,809
Are you thinking
that I said ESP?

197
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:43,451
Yes. I feel like
an idiot. Awesome.

198
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:47,285
I was a little nervous when
Pam told me he was her boss,

199
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,259
but he doesn't act
like a boss at all.

200
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,728
If I had a boss like that,
we'd never get anything done.

201
00:08:54,132 --> 00:08:55,224
So what do you think?

202
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,494
About what?

203
00:08:56,567 --> 00:08:57,864
About Julie?

204
00:08:57,936 --> 00:08:59,164
She seems nice.

205
00:08:59,237 --> 00:09:00,295
Yeah?
Yeah.

206
00:09:00,371 --> 00:09:02,737
So you like her?
Uh, yeah, sure.

207
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:04,001
So Pam was right.

208
00:09:04,075 --> 00:09:05,099
About what?

209
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:06,768
About you two
hitting it off.

210
00:09:15,887 --> 00:09:21,450
Well, apparently Michael
Scott is on a date,

211
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:26,195
and that... That, my
friend, changes everything.

212
00:09:30,068 --> 00:09:35,335
My brother, good head, bad
heart. Good head, bad heart.

213
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,634
I know.

214
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,268
Yeah, you told me
about him. JULIE: Yeah.

215
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:40,868
- Oh, boy!
- He's all right.

216
00:09:40,945 --> 00:09:43,379
Hey, Michael,
where have you been?

217
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,017
Hey, you're supposed to hit
the white ball first, buddy.

218
00:09:47,085 --> 00:09:48,177
Hey!
Nice one.

219
00:09:48,252 --> 00:09:50,186
Can I talk to you
for a second? Mmm-hmm.

220
00:09:52,023 --> 00:09:53,718
Everything okay? Why are
you wearing a hat now?

221
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,691
Guys, come on.
I'm on a date.

222
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,022
Let me do my thing.

223
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,928
Hi, I'm Date Mike.
Nice to meet me.

224
00:09:59,998 --> 00:10:02,159
How do you like
your eggs in the morning?

225
00:10:05,136 --> 00:10:06,296
Do you want to
just make a run for it?

226
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:07,531
Maybe.

227
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:15,174
Mommy!

228
00:10:20,918 --> 00:10:22,442
What is happening?

229
00:10:26,858 --> 00:10:27,950
Whoa!

230
00:10:29,527 --> 00:10:30,926
What is cracking?
One second.

231
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:32,326
Guys, we're focusing.
We can't talk.

232
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:33,625
What's this game?
One second.

233
00:10:33,698 --> 00:10:35,029
Yeah. How do you play?

234
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:37,067
Guys, guys, guys,
please. Okay.

235
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,330
All right, it's all yours.
Only three tickets.

236
00:10:39,404 --> 00:10:41,338
If we save them up, we can get
more than a sticker this time.

237
00:10:41,406 --> 00:10:42,634
Stop telling me how
to spend my tickets.

238
00:10:42,707 --> 00:10:43,731
I know,
but you wanted...

239
00:10:43,808 --> 00:10:45,537
Wow! Can you imagine
what people would say

240
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,407
if they saw us
dancing together?

241
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,502
Oh, I know.

242
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:50,774
They'd be like,
"What's up with those two?"

243
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:52,713
"Hey, guys, get
a bedroom already."

244
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:54,581
"Did we miss the wedding?"

245
00:10:55,186 --> 00:10:57,984
I got it. I'll do this and
you play the racing game

246
00:10:58,056 --> 00:10:59,683
and then we'll switch.

247
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:02,683
Yes. Okay.
Yeah, that's smart.

248
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,227
No drama. Okay.

249
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,528
Oh, air hockey, basketball.

250
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,932
We could play that.

251
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,561
Oh, Whac-A-Mole.

252
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:14,730
Any brothers or sisters?

253
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:16,239
Three brothers.
Really?

254
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:18,673
Mmm-hmm. Two are in
the Marines, one's a cop.

255
00:11:18,743 --> 00:11:20,267
Vegetarian?

256
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:21,902
No. I love meat.

257
00:11:23,414 --> 00:11:24,574
What's your blood type?

258
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,378
O negative.
Universal donor.

259
00:11:26,451 --> 00:11:28,282
Universal donor!
Mmm-hmm.

260
00:11:31,422 --> 00:11:35,290
Angela versus Isabel.
Height, advantage Isabel.

261
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,126
Birthing hips,
advantage Isabel.

262
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,924
Remaining childbearing years,
advantage Isabel.

263
00:11:42,633 --> 00:11:46,433
Legal obligation,
advantage Angela.

264
00:11:47,371 --> 00:11:49,100
<i>Hey, guys, guys,
guys. Excusez-moi. Hey.</i>

265
00:11:49,173 --> 00:11:50,834
Watch this. Ready?

266
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:54,802
What are you doing?

267
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:57,279
I'm tying a knot in
the stem with my tongue.

268
00:11:57,348 --> 00:11:59,179
Michael, you don't have
to do this.

269
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,284
Wow. That was close.

270
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,722
I would say I kind of
have an unfair advantage,

271
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:10,955
<i>because I watch reality
dating shows like a hawk.</i>

272
00:12:11,162 --> 00:12:13,528
<i>And I learn.
I absorb information</i>

273
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:16,533
<i>from the strategies of
the winners and the losers.</i>

274
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,997
Actually, I probably
learn more from the losers.

275
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,501
Hey, you two having fun?

276
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,569
Did you tell them?

277
00:12:24,642 --> 00:12:25,631
No.

278
00:12:26,811 --> 00:12:29,075
This is exactly
what I don't want.

279
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,136
The drama.

280
00:12:30,648 --> 00:12:34,744
I don't want the drama!

281
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:38,611
Oh.

282
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:42,121
You are amazing at this.
How did you get so good?

283
00:12:42,193 --> 00:12:44,627
Whacking moles.
Hit him on the head. Whack!

284
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:45,821
Whack!
Whack! Say it with me.

285
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:46,955
Whack!
Extend the fingers more.

286
00:12:47,031 --> 00:12:48,055
Whack!
Good.

287
00:12:48,132 --> 00:12:50,123
This looks like a hoot.

288
00:12:50,201 --> 00:12:51,998
Hey, monkey, how you doing? Whack.

289
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:53,764
Listen, can I talk
to you for a second?

290
00:12:53,838 --> 00:12:55,135
Okay.

291
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:59,370
You know, I've been
thinking, we had a good run,

292
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,678
we really did,
but you don't need to worry

293
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:03,304
about this whole
contract thing anymore.

294
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:04,507
It's no worry.

295
00:13:04,582 --> 00:13:07,847
It's just that we both...
We want different things.

296
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:10,215
You know,
I want a big family.

297
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:11,879
I could see enjoying that.

298
00:13:11,956 --> 00:13:14,288
No, no, no, no, no.
I want a big family.

299
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:18,454
Tall, thick. A big,
physically big family.

300
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,964
Listen, you go have fun.

301
00:13:21,566 --> 00:13:22,794
You're off the hook.

302
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:23,925
But we signed the contract.

303
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:25,468
It's dissolved.
Don't worry. You're free.

304
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:26,525
Okay? Okay.
We'll see you later.

305
00:13:26,604 --> 00:13:28,868
But we both...
And you didn't do...

306
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:36,044
Wow! Maybe we should tell her
he's not normally like this.

307
00:13:36,113 --> 00:13:37,705
Maybe it should
come from a man.

308
00:13:37,782 --> 00:13:40,182
Maybe it should
come from a note.

309
00:13:40,484 --> 00:13:42,179
With flowers. Tomorrow.

310
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:43,981
Hello.
Hello.

311
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:45,317
Hi.
Hi.

312
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,256
You want to pay 400 bucks
to re-felt this table?

313
00:13:48,326 --> 00:13:49,725
Yeah! Why don't
you send the bill

314
00:13:49,794 --> 00:13:52,592
to 23 I Don't Care Lane,
Scranton, Pennsylvania?

315
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:54,324
Hey, Michael, why
don't you just get down?

316
00:13:54,398 --> 00:13:56,798
Hey, she can tell
I'm on a date, right?

317
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:58,698
Right? We're just having fun.

318
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:00,134
Ted, we having fun?

319
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,538
Really? You told on me.
That's lame.

320
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:06,674
We got a problem?
Yes. Homelessness.

321
00:14:09,013 --> 00:14:10,810
What?
All right, go.

322
00:14:11,148 --> 00:14:12,445
Where?

323
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:13,744
Get out. Now.

324
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:15,945
Okay. All right, okay. Whoa!

325
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:23,820
I'm just kidding
around. I'm sorry.

326
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:33,403
Okay, why don't we
just finish the game?

327
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,200
Michael, it's your shot.

328
00:14:35,273 --> 00:14:36,706
She can't talk
to us that way.

329
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,207
You guys are stripes,
I think.

330
00:14:38,276 --> 00:14:40,403
You let somebody
talk to you like that,

331
00:14:40,478 --> 00:14:41,502
where does it stop?

332
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,603
It stopped.

333
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,511
Well, I am starting it again!

334
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:52,452
Do you guys
want some food?

335
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,354
The wings are
really good here.

336
00:15:05,002 --> 00:15:06,060
Hey!

337
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:09,798
You embarrassed my friends in
front of me, and I am gonna need you

338
00:15:09,874 --> 00:15:11,967
to go back over to the table
and apologize.

339
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,207
Then I am sorry that
I didn't kick you out.

340
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:20,382
I'm here with my employees.
I am here on a date.

341
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:21,475
Hello.

342
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:23,816
Well, I'm the
manager here, sir.

343
00:15:23,888 --> 00:15:25,856
Well, it just so happens
that I'm a manager, too,

344
00:15:25,923 --> 00:15:30,223
and the way I manage people is
that I touch their hearts and souls

345
00:15:30,294 --> 00:15:33,821
with humor, with love and
maybe a dash of razzle-dazzle,

346
00:15:33,931 --> 00:15:35,262
and I don't see that from you.

347
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:36,994
Is that how you do it?

348
00:15:37,068 --> 00:15:39,434
Yes, it is.
I'm writing a book about it.

349
00:15:39,637 --> 00:15:40,934
Really? How much
have you written?

350
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:42,768
I've written all of it.

351
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:46,074
In my head.

352
00:15:47,411 --> 00:15:50,346
<i>If you're really interested,
it is called Somehow I Manage,</i>

353
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:52,814
and there's going to be a picture
of me on the cover shrugging

354
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,908
with my sleeves rolled up.

355
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,421
Have you read Lee
lacocca's? It's classic.

356
00:15:58,489 --> 00:15:59,820
Read it? I own it.

357
00:16:00,391 --> 00:16:01,824
But no, I have not read it.

358
00:16:01,892 --> 00:16:03,587
Dude, tonight.

359
00:16:03,661 --> 00:16:05,492
You're not gonna want to put it
down. It's gonna make you want

360
00:16:05,563 --> 00:16:06,723
to go out and buy
a Chrysler tomorrow.

361
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,059
I own a Chrysler.

362
00:16:08,132 --> 00:16:09,156
Shut up.

363
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:10,257
No, you shut up.

364
00:16:11,669 --> 00:16:12,829
What's your drink?

365
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:14,793
Grenadine.

366
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:15,896
What?

367
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:20,933
We just have to throw everyone off
the scent a little, so follow my lead.

368
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,111
Hi.
Hi.

369
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:29,950
I don't normally do
this, but... Do what?

370
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,148
Go, go. Just sit down
next to a beautiful woman

371
00:16:33,224 --> 00:16:36,193
and start talking to myself
to confuse other people.

372
00:16:37,428 --> 00:16:40,727
Hey, big boy. Do you
like it when I do that?

373
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:45,032
What are you doing?

374
00:16:45,102 --> 00:16:46,399
What we said to do.

375
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:49,165
We didn't say we were gonna,
like, start groping strangers.

376
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,231
I was flirting with a man.

377
00:16:51,308 --> 00:16:52,605
Get in here.

378
00:16:53,711 --> 00:16:55,372
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

379
00:16:55,446 --> 00:16:57,004
The movies.
I don't know.

380
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,276
<i>What movie?
Black Snake Moan?</i>

381
00:16:59,683 --> 00:17:02,709
I manage a paper company.
Dunder Mifflin-Sabre.

382
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,809
Do you have a card?

383
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:06,015
I did. I actually
put it in your bowl.

384
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:10,386
Stanley Hudson?

385
00:17:10,461 --> 00:17:11,519
No. No.

386
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:14,488
Whoa! A lot of Stanley Hudsons in here.

387
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:15,862
No, it's Michael Scott.

388
00:17:15,933 --> 00:17:16,991
Michael Scott?

389
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,125
He is I.

390
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:19,726
You just won
yourself a lunch.

391
00:17:19,804 --> 00:17:21,237
Oh. Hey, guys!

392
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:25,871
I think I'm gonna go.

393
00:17:25,943 --> 00:17:27,137
Really?

394
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:30,079
I'm sorry.
He's not usually like that.

395
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:31,580
What's he usually like?

396
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,975
He's more just...

397
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:40,548
Like... You can go.
Yeah.

398
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:41,955
All right.

399
00:17:42,393 --> 00:17:44,190
Bye.
See you.

400
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,888
Nice girl.
Yeah.

401
00:17:47,164 --> 00:17:49,655
Hey! Julie, having fun?

402
00:17:56,407 --> 00:18:00,241
So, when are you
coming in for that free lunch?

403
00:18:00,878 --> 00:18:03,847
You're gonna want to come
in on a day that I'm working.

404
00:18:04,682 --> 00:18:07,048
Maybe I can hear
more about that book, too.

405
00:18:11,322 --> 00:18:15,053
Hey, man. You put together a
pretty fun night for everybody.

406
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:19,526
I saw you talking to Hide. Did
you hear that dude's life story?

407
00:18:19,597 --> 00:18:20,621
It's amazing, right?

408
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,529
I couldn't understand
a word he said.

409
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,194
Let me tell you something,
Oscar, all right?

410
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:28,597
Matt's an okay dude,
but he's a dummy.

411
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,137
You guys got
nothing in common.

412
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,904
Maybe you're right. I
should count myself lucky.

413
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:34,967
Hey, what's up?

414
00:18:35,045 --> 00:18:36,706
There he is! Hey!

415
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,941
Anyone up for some hoops?
Yeah. Hoops!

416
00:18:39,016 --> 00:18:41,177
Let's do it.
- Hoop it. Yeah.

417
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:57,265
This is not what I want
my relationship to look like.

418
00:19:01,739 --> 00:19:03,366
<i>Hi, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

419
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,035
<i>My name is Andrew Bernard and I've
been on two dates with Erin Hannon</i>

420
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:10,672
<i>and they went well, and
there will probably be more.</i>

421
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:12,946
<i>Thank you.</i>

422
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,510
You know,
it got to the point

423
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:17,213
where keeping it a secret
was just too much drama.

424
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:20,553
And I hate drama,
so... There you go.

425
00:19:20,624 --> 00:19:21,613
You love drama.

426
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:22,681
I know, I do, right?

427
00:19:23,861 --> 00:19:25,829
I'm a total drama queen.

428
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,562
This move?
He can't get you.

429
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:29,462
I think that he could counter that move.

430
00:19:29,533 --> 00:19:31,933
The Scranton Strangler
is a professional strangler.

431
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,765
Oh, please. I wish he'd come
after me. I would be like...

432
00:19:33,837 --> 00:19:35,134
Dwight Schrute!

433
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,638
Dwight Kurt Schrute.
Shut up, what?

434
00:19:36,707 --> 00:19:38,231
You are hereby served
with this summons

435
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,640
to appear in
Lackawanna County court...

436
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,836
No, no, no.
...for breach of contract

437
00:19:40,911 --> 00:19:42,811
against Angela Noelle Martin.

438
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,575
What are you talking
about? What are you...

439
00:19:44,648 --> 00:19:48,015
Dwight recently entered into a
contract with me, establishing intent

440
00:19:48,085 --> 00:19:50,280
to conceive and raise
a child with me. Angela.

441
00:19:50,354 --> 00:19:51,787
Did he not tell you that?
What?

442
00:19:51,855 --> 00:19:54,085
You're really putting me
in an awkward position here.

443
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,023
Do you plan on
raising a child with me,

444
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:57,754
or do you plan on
breaking this contract?

445
00:19:57,828 --> 00:19:59,455
Angela! Not here!

446
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,724
Dwight.

447
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:03,126
Whack.

448
00:20:04,435 --> 00:20:07,063
You will see me in
small claims court!

449
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:10,202
You are an
impressive specimen.

450
00:20:10,274 --> 00:20:11,332
Thank you.

451
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,608
And I spilled my drink and
they wouldn't give me a refill.

452
00:20:20,684 --> 00:20:23,482
Oh, my gosh. Okay, yeah,
we have to get home.

453
00:20:23,554 --> 00:20:24,782
Okay.
Yes!

454
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:27,050
Halperts, wait up!
What a great night!

455
00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:28,716
Got to hang out
with my peeps.

456
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:31,317
Sort of did okay
with a new young lady.

457
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:32,555
Actually you didn't.
Not at all.

458
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:35,190
I think I did, but I
can't take all the credit.

459
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:39,224
Some of the credit is due, in
fact, to my good friend Date Mike.

460
00:20:40,237 --> 00:20:41,829
Nice to meet me.

461
00:20:47,277 --> 00:20:48,642
Tell me your story, Hide.
