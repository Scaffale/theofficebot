1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,002
Ho-ho

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,254
Look who's back reporting
for duty Hey, guys

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:07,256
Hey
Hi

4
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:08,924
Pam! Ha

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,884
Look what I can do now that
she's no longer pregnant

6
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:12,344
Bam! Bam! Bam! Pam

7
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,929
Are you glad
to be back?

8
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:17,057
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I could have
used another week, or three

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:19,268
You still had eight
weeks more than we did.

10
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,770
Well, it's not
exactly a vacation

11
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:25,315
Hello, everyone! Remember?
Little old me. Hi

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,234
What are you doing here?
You just had our baby.

13
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:32,614
Our collective Dunder Mifflin
family baby four days ago.

14
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,199
I wanted to come
back to work.

15
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,579
Not everybody needs some long,
luxurious, Parisian maternity leave

16
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,998
Damn, girl! Your body!
What?

17
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:42,875
Angela, you
look amazing

18
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:46,503
Really? I feel like
this big rhinoceros

19
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,466
Anyway, I wanted to thank you guys for
covering for me, so I made some treats

20
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,384
I've got brownies
and magic cookie bars

21
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:53,969
Mm-mm-mm

22
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,682
Angela, those brownies have walnuts in them
and I think Kevin's allergic to walnuts.

23
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,309
You're allergic to
walnuts right, Kevin?

24
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,644
Extremely, but I'm going
to fight through it

25
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,689
It's okay, Angela. I have mommy brain, too

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,441
what that is, Pam

27
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,152
special for you,
Kevin. Right here.

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,029
When did you find time
to do all this?

29
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,323
Babies sleep a lot, Pam
if you feed them enough

30
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,992
Brownie, Pam?

31
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,207
Thank you

32
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:27,169
Oh, my gosh
It's really good

33
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,546
I'm watching my weight

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,762
Say, guys, you know what's an even
more useful treat is cash. So

35
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,681
Nope. It's over. No. Okay
We wanted to say thank you

36
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,360
Dwight, I have exciting
news for you What?

37
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,238
Going to like it

38
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,656
You can't tantalize me

39
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,033
Oh, maybe I can

40
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,285
I got an e-mail
from corporate

41
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,412
that told me
Okay.

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,456
...that you got
a promotion

43
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,836
Right? I mean, that's not the kind of thing
you want to read quietly at your desk

44
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,255
If you make me head of sales
one more time, I swear

45
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:12,339
No. This is legit

46
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,135
You will be assembling a team to
go to Tallahassee for three weeks

47
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,721
to develop and launch
a chain of Sabre stores

48
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:23,267
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes

49
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,561
Yes! Yes! Yes!

50
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,565
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes

51
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,441
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah
Yeah! Yeah!

52
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,818
The Schrutes
have a word for when

53
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,988
everything in a man's life
comes together perfectly

54
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,990
"Perfektenschlag.'

55
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,825
Right now, I'm in it

56
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,119
I finally get a chance to
prove myself to corporate

57
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,414
a competent team
I am likely a father

58
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:50,377
I am so deep inside of
perfektenschlag right now

59
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,338
And just to be clear,
there is a second definition

60
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,841
"perfect pork anus, '
which I don't mean

61
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,218
And here's
the fax for you

62
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,512
And here's
some facts for you

63
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,098
Did you know frogs can
hear with their lungs?

64
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,935
And that flamingos can have
orgasms that last 30 minutes

65
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,772
Love to learn. Yeah, it's weird
that I said that last one.

66
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,608
So

67
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,860
Yeah, look at that
We're pin twins.

68
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,278
Pin twins

69
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:18,864
This is a gift from Jessica
Kind of a gag gift, really

70
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:19,990
Real gifts come later

71
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,326
Yeah. That's cute

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,078
When I saw it at CVS
it made me gag, too. Just

73
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,546
For a while there, I thought
something would change, but nope.

74
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,881
Andy's still with Jessica

75
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,050
They even carpool
together most days.

76
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,509
I don't know.

77
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,554
I wouldn't mind carpooling
every day with Andy,

78
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,265
but I wouldn't want to spend
that much time with Jessica

79
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,936
What do we have here?

80
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,816
Val knit me a beanie.

81
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,985
But I can't tell if it's a
"We're just friends" beanie

82
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,030
or a "I'm hot, you're hot,
let's get it popping" beanie

83
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,950
So I'm going
to up the ante

84
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:05,661
Give her a clearly
romantic gift.

85
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,330
And we'll get to the
meaning of the beanie.

86
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,083
Pam, pack up your
post-natal swimwear

87
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,793
make it a one piece or
this offer is rescinded

88
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,755
and join me for a fantastic barbeque one
week from today in Tallahassee, Florida

89
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,632
where I'm going to be living
for the next three weeks.

90
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,592
Really?
Mm-hmm

91
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,427
I'll fly anywhere
for some good barbeque

92
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,512
Ooh, me three

93
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,516
No plus ones. This is for
competent workers only.

94
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,143
And don't worry about the cost.
Sabre is footing the bill

95
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,604
Does this have anything to do with
what you were talking to Andy about?

96
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,064
God, you're
such a spy.

97
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,695
Notice anything
different about me?

98
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,822
You're wearing the beanie.
You like it?

99
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,658
Super comfortable Like
sweatpants for my head.

100
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,703
It's really itchy

101
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,373
uh, but to be fair, my
head is constantly itching

102
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,042
so I can't really
peg it on the hat

103
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,213
Wow. It's like the Nation
of Islam down here.

104
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,799
Don't hate.

105
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,385
Who's that for?

106
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:08,140
Oh. This is a gift for
my man Nate here.

107
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,433
What?
Yeah

108
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,851
Darryl, you
shouldn't have

109
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,479
Can I open it? No, no,
no maybe just later

110
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,732
Ah, I can't wait I'm sorry.
I'm too excited.

111
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,654
Darryl

112
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,531
Wow. Those
are really nice

113
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,283
They're so elegant

114
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,243
Cashmere
How did you know?

115
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,245
Just a hunch

116
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,748
Your gift is on the way

117
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,082
Can't wait

118
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:38,337
"I'm glad you're in my life
Happy Valentine's Day."

119
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,090
Darryl, I am glad
to be in your life, too

120
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,261
Your card is more
beautiful than the gloves

121
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:52,017
My first task as special project
manager Dwight Schrute,

122
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:53,977
assembling a crack team.

123
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:56,813
I need people who are loyal,

124
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,942
people who will help me get an inroad
with the gay Hispanic community.

125
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,195
People who won't be missed.

126
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,323
We don't need idiots.

127
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,034
Good for nothings.

128
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:10,952
Meth heads.

129
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,455
Or...

130
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,956
What's your name?

131
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,167
Cathy
Cathy.

132
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:24,841
I just got a text from
Robert California that says

133
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,468
"Bring your clubs
to Florida."

134
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,804
Why? Does he think you're
going to Florida?

135
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,515
I hope not. Because
I am not going.

136
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,725
Two question marks?

137
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,396
No, just do one. Two question
marks is kind of aggressive

138
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,272
You know, it's like
"Well, what?"

139
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:41,274
Just do one

140
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,986
You want to take Darryl Phyllis,
Toby, Angela and Oscar?

141
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,071
Yes

142
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,615
Can I interest you
in someone less essential?

143
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:50,992
Like a Creed or a
Meredith perhaps?

144
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,161
Oh, my God They're not
expendable exactly

145
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,747
I can't think of the word
I'm trying to find

146
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:56,998
Are you kidding me?

147
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,959
I'm supposed to get on an
airplane with those nincompoops?

148
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,127
We'd never make it
off the runway

149
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,630
All right, look, I got to keep
this office functioning somehow

150
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:06,383
so I have put
together a list

151
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,926
Here's your team

152
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,553
Darryl and Phyllis
you can have

153
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,013
You're also taking Cathy
Kelly and Kevin.

154
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,182
Oh, God.
You have your team

155
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,686
Kevin? Kelly? Cathy?

156
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,147
Andy just gave me a chain
with three weak links

157
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,316
Have you ever tried to use a chain
with three weak links? I have

158
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,861
And now I no longer
own an Arctic Wolf

159
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,197
Well, let's hear it

160
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,950
"Robert, hey,"
exclamation point I like it so far

161
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,618
"Got your text
Awesome idea

162
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:37,080
"Let's hit the links the next
time you're in PA. -J.H.'

163
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:42,043
It's perfect. You emphasize the
golf, completely omit the Florida

164
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,378
Yeah, it's a golf text

165
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,422
Total golf text. Send it

166
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:50,469
Done. Wait, I just feel weird
I should just call him

167
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,639
You want to call someone that texted you?
Do you want to drive them away? I mean

168
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,603
This is Darryl

169
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,980
Sorry, I asked for
the main shipment number.

170
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,607
I just need the address
for the warehouse.

171
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,275
My girlfriend
some flowers.

172
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:09,070
Your girlfriend?
Is your girlfriend Val?

173
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,072
Yeah. Do you know her?

174
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,160
We're friends
We're friends

175
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,830
Cool. So can I get
that address or...

176
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,167
Yeah, yeah. Sorry I'm
just looking for a pen

177
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,293
Why do you
need a pen?

178
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,212
Back off I got my reasons

179
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,172
May I have your
attention, please?

180
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,007
Could Cathy, Phyllis,
Darryl, Kevin and Kelly

181
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,092
please join me in the
conference room immediately?

182
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,636
Why?
No big deal

183
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,931
It's just that you five have been
deemed most deserving of a three-week

184
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,433
all expenses paid business
trip to Tallahassee, Florida

185
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,560
Hell, yeah
What?

186
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:43,855
I'm sorry, Stanley. I can't
share any more details with you

187
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,024
You see
Andy rejected you

188
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,109
Wait
Cathy gets to go?

189
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,403
Why does she even still work here?
Pam is back.

190
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,863
It just feels like
a slap in the face

191
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,698
I can understand your pain.
And your rage.

192
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,951
But you know what?
Andy is an honorable man

193
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,246
Let us not question his choices.
I'm sure he had his reasons.

194
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,790
We're not questioning his reasons.
I just want to know what they are

195
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,124
I know. You and me
both, brother.

196
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,376
It seemed kind
of random to me

197
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,338
but he was pretty clear on who he thought
truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.

198
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:13,093
Well, he nailed it because
I do deserve a vacation

199
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,554
Sometimes Batman's
got to take off his cape

200
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,848
Good point. But we're going to be
working pretty hard until 5:00 p.m

201
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,811
After that, it's going to be beach
volleyball trips to Cape Canaveral

202
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,813
and sea kayaking
with Gloria Estefan

203
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,565
What were the
criteria for going?

204
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,985
It might be innate goodness
versus innate badness

205
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:32,153
But there's an easy
way to find out

206
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,992
Oh, Andy, got a few
questions for you

207
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,661
Moshi moshi.

208
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,372
Uh, the Florida
picks got out,

209
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,417
and people were just kind of curious
as to why they weren't picked,

210
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:47,419
and maybe you
could just clarify

211
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:48,503
Uh.

212
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:55,093
Well, the deliberations were confidential,
so I feel like we should respect that.

213
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,053
Respect it? You're
trying to tell me

214
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,347
Kevin Malone deserves more
than Stanley Hudson?

215
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,600
Hey
Okay, it's obvious

216
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,936
that Andy picked the people that
are least important to the office.

217
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,606
Important? Because you and
your enormous monster baby

218
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,773
are so important
to the branch?

219
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:10,692
My baby is
not a monster

220
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,153
Hey, be proud of your
enormous monster baby

221
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,946
an enormous
monster baby

222
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:18,325
Guys! Guys! Guys

223
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:23,413
Come on, seriously, we cannot let this
trip cause this kind of rift, guys

224
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,789
Stop calling us "guys"

225
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:28,877
when I'm nervous, guys

226
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,171
Guys, guys, guys. Guys.
- Stop it

227
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,131
Stop! Stop it! Andy

228
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,592
Dudes

229
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:39,971
The dudes who are going to Florida
were picked by Dwight and me

230
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,973
Okay, hey, I
specifically remember

231
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,267
that there were a lot of other people
I thought should be considered.

232
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,393
Uh.

233
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,395
If anybody's going to
Florida, it should be me.

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,649
Every shirt that I have that isn't
a work shirt is a Tommy Bahama.

235
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,401
I'm the only person in this
office who watches Burn Notice.

236
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:56,655
Okay. I did not realize that so
many of you wanted to go so badly

237
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,824
so if you feel like you have a
very good reason to go to Florida,

238
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,409
I'm happy to hear you out.
Great idea

239
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,495
So why doesn't everyone just
take the next five to six hours

240
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,955
come up with a statement on why you
feel you deserve to go to Florida,

241
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
and Andy and I
will listen to it.

242
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,793
No, that is a ridiculous waste of time.
For you maybe

243
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,711
Five to six hours?
Three to four hours

244
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:14,005
No, no, no, no. No.
Just two to three hours

245
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,508
Come up with a statement
over the next hour.

246
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:17,592
Thirty minutes

247
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,427
I'm out

248
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,970
Okay, read it
back to me

249
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,515
"Robert, great offer. Wish I could
hit the links with you in Florida,

250
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,768
"but a father of a newborn really should be
helping out his wife any chance he gets.'

251
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,397
Good. Doesn't sound pushy
You're just stating a fact

252
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,440
Absolutely
Works for me

253
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,068
Okay. Sending.

254
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,570
Well done. And we managed
to kill the entire morning

255
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,280
We really did

256
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,955
He responded, "L.O.L.'

257
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,550
I am already...

258
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:02,345
I already picked my team, Darryl,
Oscar, Angela, Phyllis and Toby.

259
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,305
And that is the team
that I am taking.

260
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:07,726
What's that? It's not up to me?
I only have influence?

261
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,603
Well, that's all
Baltzer Glattfuelder had

262
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:13,356
and now no one eats
owls for Thanksgiving

263
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,025
You have two young dynamic
people in this office

264
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,819
who know trends
who know youth.

265
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:20,905
That's myself and Kelly Kapoor
you need one of us there

266
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,826
Or both? Not both. Just one. Me

267
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,370
Or if not me, Kelly
Ideally me

268
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,788
Again, youth knowledge

269
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,499
that's what you get when you put Ryan
Howard on your special project team

270
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:35,170
Or Kelly Kapoor.
Again, not both. Thanks

271
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,131
Very impressive

272
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,675
He put a lot of work into that.
Mm-hmm

273
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,761
PowerPoints are the peacocks
of the business world

274
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,387
All show, no meat

275
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,600
Because I feel like that I am in
a place with my gambling rehab

276
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:52,020
that I can finally start
going to dog racing again

277
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:57,108
You know, just sitting
watching, enjoying the sport

278
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:01,446
Maybe putting down a few dollars if there's
like a crazy mismatch or something

279
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,615
Okay. Thank you Kevin,
we'll let you know.

280
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,366
Thank you.
When do we leave?

281
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,035
Thank you

282
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,371
It really has been
a long, lonely winter

283
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:14,417
Wow. Seasonal affective
disorder, a.k.a. SAD.

284
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,878
That sounds like
a very real thing, Toby

285
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,714
It is real. Thank you
for saying that

286
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,592
Yeah, wow,
it's almost like

287
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,638
we're not all experiencing
the same winter

288
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:30,391
Florida Stanley smiles Florida
Stanley is happy to go to work

289
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,228
Florida Stanley is who you
want on your Florida team

290
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,941
It's still... Well
...she does here

291
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,901
Hey, guys.
Any spots left?

292
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:41,903
Erin, you want to go
to Tallahassee?

293
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,199
I think it would be a
nice way to clear my head

294
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,744
You know, I don't think it's a good
idea for you to clear your head

295
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,663
any more than it
has been already

296
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,414
a workplace where

297
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,960
the burdens of everyday life
keep you tethered to reality

298
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,461
Either or

299
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,214
But if you can find someone to
fill in, I would love to go

300
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,424
Well, it wouldn't be hard
to find someone to fill in

301
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,804
Really? Oh, great. Good

302
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:11,099
Now, is it too dark to say that
Cece's having an operation?

303
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,101
I think you need
to go to Florida.

304
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,689
It's only for three weeks

305
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,858
You know, with my mom and
sister at the house, it'll be

306
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:20,984
A total nightmare

307
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,070
because I'll have
all the help I need

308
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:25,738
Yeah, that's what I'm saying
They're incredibly helpful.

309
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,073
You're lucky
to have them

310
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:28,741
With them there, you probably
won't even know I'm gone

311
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,076
Exactly

312
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,788
Well

313
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:39,127
No. No! Absolutely not You are not going!
Over my dead body, no. Andy

314
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,421
Toons, I'm really sorry

315
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,715
You're too essential to the
operation here I can't let you go.

316
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,259
I wouldn't say that
That's a bit much

317
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,677
You know, Dwight if you
didn't want me to go

318
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,847
the smart move would be to tell Andy that
I actually am essential to the operation

319
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,098
That way, I couldn't go

320
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,393
Jim is essential Hold on. I
just want to get it on camera.

321
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,940
Andy, Jim is just too

322
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,150
Essential

323
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,943
This is stupid! Cut

324
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,320
All right. I'm going
to pack my trunks

325
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:06,446
He doesn't even
want to go.

326
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:07,947
Well, I got a text
from R.C.

327
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,618
inviting me to come down so I think
that's going to make us roommates.

328
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,870
Oh, my God

329
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,081
Hey, quick question, do you shower at
night? Or do you shower in the morning?

330
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,667
Because I want to shower when
you're showering to save some water

331
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,672
Okay, listen up, everyone
Here's who's going to Florida

332
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,382
Cathy
What?

333
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,592
Stanley.
No

334
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:28,801
Ryan.
No

335
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,011
Erin.

336
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,346
And Jim

337
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,681
You got to be *
kidding me. Okay

338
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,017
Okay

339
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,853
Florida group,
welcome to the team

340
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,281
Let's go

341
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,618
Step it up, you runts.
You infants. Let's move

342
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,119
Why is it so
hot in here?

343
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,248
Hot? What are you talking about? This
is a nice, temperate Florida morning

344
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,376
Eighty-five degrees
73% humidity.

345
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,003
This is the exact environment
that you will be facing

346
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,130
for the next three
weeks of your life.

347
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,634
Welcome to Special
Projects orientation.

348
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,761
The next three weeks
of your life

349
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:15,223
are going to be the most
miserable you've ever faced.

350
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,017
They're going to be hard
They're going to be dirty

351
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,395
You're going to
wish you were dead

352
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,313
But?

353
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,107
"But?" There's no "buts.'

354
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,068
That's it. You'll wish you were dead.
You seem a little disturbed

355
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,861
Do you want to stay here?
No. No. I want to go.

356
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,156
Because if any of you
would prefer to stay here

357
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,367
all you need to do
is ring this bell

358
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,244
Is that the buzzer
from Taboo?

359
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,621
Shut up, maggot
It is.

360
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,373
You don't want to go
ring the be

361
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,417
Ring it. Ring it

362
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,753
How many of you have seen the
documentary Deliverance?

363
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:48,965
How did a mosquito
get in here?

364
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,843
I released 300 mosquitoes
into the conference room.

365
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,177
Just temporarily

366
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,055
When I'm done, the frogs will
take care of the mosquitoes.

367
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,478
Yes. And then he brushes
your soft supple cheeks

368
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:05,815
with his worn leathery
hands and says

369
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,027
"I'm going to make you
the seventh Mrs. Rosenblat!'

370
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:10,778
Unless you ring
the bell. Ring it

371
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,946
No.
Ring the bell

372
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,866
You want to spend the rest of your life
changing your husband's colostomy bags?

373
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,285
Huh? Do you? Ring it
What? Ah.

374
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,288
What was that?
Mosquito

375
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,047
Orientation's over

376
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,467
Darryl, hey

377
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:33,634
Hey, what's up?
You called?

378
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,928
Yeah, you know,
I felt really terrible

379
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,473
that you got me these lovely gloves,
and I didn't get you anything

380
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,599
It's cool, really

381
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,517
No, it's anything
but cool.

382
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:46,731
Now, I haven't really had time to
go out and buy you anything, but

383
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,232
here goes

384
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:51,944
"This coupon entitles you to one
free tickle monster attack."

385
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:55,531
Yeah. They're Nate coupons or
Nate-pons And they're all different

386
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:58,367
Cash that one in and I will
bring you a stick of gum

387
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:01,913
any time, any place
I'll find you.

388
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,290
Thanks

389
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,251
Nice flowers

390
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,878
Thanks. They're
from my mom.

391
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,756
Your mom?

392
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,092
Yeah

393
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,384
Oh

394
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:19,222
So I guess that was your mom who called
me earlier looking for the address.

395
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,515
Real deep-voiced woman

396
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,183
Yeah, that's her

397
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,186
She said her name
was Brandon, I think

398
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,813
Your mom's name
is Brandon?

399
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:31,984
Yeah, Darryl. My mom's
name is Brandon

400
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:38,908
out where I stand

401
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,036
This is a love beanie

402
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,292
Okay, Florida team
let's reconvene.

403
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm going to Florida
And I'm not coming back

404
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,813
So Sabre has set up a conference room
for our use while we're at corporate.

405
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,731
So what is this
special project?

406
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,525
Basically, Sabre has
tasked us with

407
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,527
helping them branch into
the retail market place

408
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,404
They want to set up their own
version of an Apple store.

409
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:17,738
That sounds awesome

410
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,699
It did. It did

411
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:20,825
You know what
might be great?

412
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,703
Is if instead of a genius
bar, we have a lounge area

413
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,997
where people can ask
questions about the product

414
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,582
with other customers
who liked it

415
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:31,586
Yeah, and they should have a place where
people can check their computers or printers

416
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,130
before they see you, so you don't
have to carry it around like a dope

417
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,756
Like a coat check

418
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,680
Oh, don't write it down
unless you like it

419
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:43,764
Oh, I like it

420
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,851
It seems to me that the Apple
store is kind of like a party

421
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,770
so I think our question is how
do we make this a better party?

422
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,524
No. We sell business tools and
the stores need to reflect that.

423
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,944
They need to be all business Let all the
other stores look like a toy store.

424
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,364
Right. Think different
From Apple.

425
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,286
Dwight, is now a good time to
go over what you expect of us?

426
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,420
Yes

427
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,339
What are my expectations
for the group?

428
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:19,884
I have been given the responsibility
to manage Stanley, a solid player.

429
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,094
Ryan, who is capable
of surprises.

430
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,013
Erin, an excellent
follower.

431
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:27,475
And Cathy, a probably not
totally useless enigma.

432
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:29,977
And, well, Jim.

433
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,315
Under the right manager
that's not a bad team.

434
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,151
Perfektenschlag

435
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,493
I'm going to live here
without you

436
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,246
Me neither. Hey, will you
put this coat on my chair?

437
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,664
I just realized I'm not
going to need it down there

438
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,374
Yes, I will take
your coat.

439
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,792
And I will keep it
with me

440
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,585
and I will sleep with it
because it smells like you

441
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,003
No, no, no, no, no.
Just put it on my chair

442
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,215
All right
Bye

443
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,717
Bye. Call me when
you land I will.

444
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,011
Safe travels

445
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,181
Goodbye for a very
very long time.

446
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,350
Okay

447
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,185
It's only three weeks

448
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,191
All expenses paid

449
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,735
Yeah. Jim's going
to be there.

450
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,197
That marriage is not good
Nobody knows better than me

451
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,033
Definitely, we will

452
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,328
It's three weeks in Tallahassee.
What else is there to do?
